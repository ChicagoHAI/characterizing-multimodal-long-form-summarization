Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following presents management's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nCaution About Forward-Looking Statements\nWe make certain forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals. The words \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including:\n\u2022 the risks of changes in interest rates on levels, composition and costs of deposits, loan demand, and the values and liquidity of loan collateral, securities, and interest sensitive assets and liabilities;\n\u2022 changes in assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible loan losses, reserves for repurchases of mortgage loans sold and other estimates;\n\u2022 changes in market conditions, specifically declines in the residential and commercial real estate market, volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, soundness of other financial institutions we do business with;\n\u2022 decrease in the volume of loan originations at our mortgage banking subsidiary as a result of the cyclical nature of mortgage banking, changes in interest rates, economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market which would negatively impact the income recorded on the sales of loans held for sale.\n\u2022 risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values;\n\u2022 declines in the prices of assets and market illiquidity may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment or other losses, specifically in our pooled trust preferred\nsecurities portfolio resulting from increases in underlying issuers' defaulting or deferring payments;\n\u2022 changes in operations within the wealth management services segment, its customer base and assets under management;\n\u2022 changes in operations of George Mason Mortgage, LLC as a result of the activity in the residential real estate market and any associated impact on the fair value of goodwill in the future;\n\u2022 legislative and regulatory changes, including the Financial Reform Act and implementation of the Volcker Rule, and other changes in banking, securities, and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators, and changes in scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverages;\n\u2022 exposure to repurchase loans sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor;\n\u2022 the risks of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including, without limitation, the related time and costs of implementing such transactions, integrating operations as part of these transactions and possible failures to achieve expected gains, revenue growth and/or expense savings from such transactions;\n\u2022 the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies as we implement new or change internal operating systems or if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future;\n\u2022 the effects of future economic, business and market conditions;\n\u2022 governmental monetary and fiscal policies;\n\u2022 changes in accounting policies, rules and practices;\n\u2022 maintaining cost controls and asset quality as we open or acquire new branches;\n\u2022 maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth;\n\u2022 reliance on our management team, including our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022 competition with other banks and financial institutions, and companies outside of the banking industry, including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources;\n\u2022 demand, development and acceptance of new products and services;\n\u2022 problems with technology utilized by us;\n\u2022 changing trends in customer profiles and behavior; and\n\u2022 other factors described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC.\nBecause of these uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results.\nIn addition, this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A above.\nOverview\nWe are a financial holding company formed in 1997 and headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia. We were formed principally in response to opportunities resulting from the consolidation of several Virginia-based banks. These bank consolidations were typically accompanied by the dissolution of local boards of directors and relocation or termination of management and customer service professionals and a general deterioration of personalized customer service.\nOn January 16, 2014, we announced the completion of our acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. (\"UFBC\"), the holding company of The Business Bank (\"TBB\"), pursuant to a previously announced definitive merger agreement. The merger of UFBC into Cardinal was effective January 16, 2014. Under the terms of the merger agreement, UFBC shareholders received $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our common stock in exchange for each share of UFBC common stock they owned immediately prior to the merger. TBB, which was headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, merged into Cardinal Bank effective March 8, 2014.\nWe own Cardinal Bank (the \"Bank\"), a Virginia state-chartered community bank with 31 banking offices located in Northern Virginia and the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers. Our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors, commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals, such as physicians, accountants and attorneys.\nAdditionally, we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries, including mortgage banking through George Mason Mortgage, LLC (\"George Mason\") and retail securities brokerage though Cardinal Wealth Services, Inc. (\"CWS\").\nPrior to June 30, 2013, the Bank had a trust division, Cardinal Trust and Investment Services. This division merged its remaining operations as of June 30, 2013 into CWS. In addition, as of June 30, 2013, Wilson/Bennett Capital Management, Inc., formerly the Company's second nonbank subsidiary, merged its operations into CWS. During the second quarter of 2013, we exited the third party institutional custody and trustee component of our trust services division due to our limited opportunity to leverage this platform. As a result of our reorganization of the wealth management business segment, the remaining personal and commercial trust area of this business consolidated into CWS. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries.\nWe had a second mortgage subsidiary, Cardinal First Mortgage, LLC (\"Cardinal First\") based in Fairfax, Virginia, but as of June 30, 2013, this subsidiary merged into George Mason to improve operational efficiency. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries.\nGeorge Mason, based in Fairfax, Virginia, engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through 17 offices located throughout the metropolitan Washington region. George Mason does business in eight states, primarily Virginia and Maryland, and the District of Columbia. George Mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, generating originations of approximately $3.6 billion in 2015 and $3.0 billion in 2014. George Mason's primary sources of revenue include loan origination fees, net interest income earned on loans held for sale, and gains on sales of loans. At the time we enter into an interest rate lock arrangement with the borrower, we enter into a loan forward sale commitment with a third party. Our mortgage loans are then sold servicing released.\nGeorge Mason also offers a construction-to-permanent loan program. This program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences. Once the home has been completed, the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market. These\nconstruction-to-permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for George Mason and are classified as loans held for sale.\nThe mortgage banking segment's business is both cyclical and seasonal. The cyclical nature of its business is influenced by, among other factors, the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates, national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy. Historically, the mortgage banking segment has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year. However, the decrease in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2015 increased refinancing activity for George Mason as it did for other mortgage banking entities, and contributed to our increased loan origination activity for the full 2015 year as compared to 2014.\nWilson/Bennett provided asset management services to certain of our customers. Wilson/Bennett's primary source of revenue was management fees earned on the assets it managed for its customers. These management fees were generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets. As part of our reorganization of the wealth management services business segment, we merged Wilson/Bennett operations into CWS as of June 30, 2013.\nWe formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Cardinal Statutory Trust I, for the purpose of issuing $20.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (\"trust preferred securities\"). These trust preferred securities are due in 2034 and pay interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 2.40%, which adjusts quarterly. These securities are redeemable at par. The interest rate on this debt was 2.91% at December 31, 2015. We have guaranteed payment of these securities. The $20.6 million payable by us to Cardinal Statutory Trust I is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity. We utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the Bank.\nIn connection with the UFBC acquisition, we acquired all of the voting and common shares of UFBC Capital Trust I (the \"UFBC Trust\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary established for the sole purpose of issuing $5.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. These trust preferred securities are due in 2035 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.10%, which adjusts quarterly. At December 31, 2015, the interest rate on trust preferred securities was 2.61%. The UFBC Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary since we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity. The additional $155,000 that is payable by us to the UFBC Trust represents the unfunded capital investment in the UFBC Trust.\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue. We define revenue as net interest income plus non-interest income. As discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section, we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize, and concurrently stabilize, net interest income. We do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but are unable to eliminate it entirely. In addition to managing interest rate risk, we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk. Loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry, and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit. In addition to net interest income, non-interest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes, among other things, service charges on deposits and loans, investment fee income, gains and losses on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and gains on sales of mortgage loans.\nNet interest income and non-interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue, which is calculated as net interest income plus non-interest income, for the three years ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Net Interest\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Non-Interest\nIncome </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest income represented a larger portion of our total revenue for 2015 relative to 2014 as a result of a significant increase in gains realized and unrealized on mortgage loans held for sale. In addition to an increase in originations in 2015 compared to 2014, we also experienced an increase in gain on sale margins of approximately 20 basis points which was result of implementing our mandatory delivery loan sale program during the last six months of 2015. For 2014, non-interest income was a larger portion of our total revenue base compared to 2013 as the rate compression we experienced on gain on sale margins for loans sold during 2013 subsided during 2014 as the interest rate environment was not as volatile during 2014 as compared to 2013.\n2015 Economic Environment\nThe banking environment and the markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. and global economies, as well as the continued implementation of rulemaking from recent financial reforms. The U.S. economy grew during 2015 for the seventh consecutive year. While economic growth struggled to reach 2% during 2015, the labor market continued to improve. Employment gains were generally steady as the national unemployment rate fell to 5.0% by year end. With steady employment gains and continued low oil prices, consumer spending increased at a strong pace for most of 2015 and residential construction gained momentum. Nationally, home prices continued to rise by more than 5% during 2015 as equity markets remained fairly unchanged. U.S. Treasury yields were unstable during 2015 but began to rise modestly over the year as a Federal Reserve rate increase was expected. At its final meeting in 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee raised its targeted Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, its first rate increase in over nine years.\nAlthough global economic conditions remain unsettled, the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, the region we operate in, continued to perform relatively well, compared to other regions. As we believe that our region has weathered the recession better than most over the past several years, a protracted low interest rate environment, and the burden of regulatory requirements enacted in response to the recent financial crisis made for a challenging 2015. The housing industry and unemployment indicators improved during 2015 compared to 2014, where the effect of federal sequestration and spending cuts dampened economic growth and employment in defense-related professional and business service sectors. Progress in the near future for employment and the housing industry is uncertain given the prospect for higher long-term interest rates. We continue to consider future economic events and their impact on our performance.\nThe unemployment rate in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area decreased in tandem to the national unemployment rate to 3.8%, and commercial and residential real estate values held up well compared to other regions.\nOur credit quality continues to remain strong despite the challenging economic environment. At December 31, 2015, we had nonaccrual loans totaling $451,000 and no loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing. We recorded annualized net recoveries of 0.07% of our average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of a decrease in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2015, refinancing originations from our mortgage\nbanking segment increased significantly during 2015 to 31% of total originations for the full year 2015 compared to 21% of total originations for 2014.\nMarket illiquidity and concerns over credit risk continue to impact the ratings of our pooled trust preferred securities. We hold investments of $3.8 million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities, which are significantly below book value as of December 31, 2015 due to the lack of liquidity in the market, deferrals and defaults of issuers, and continued investor apprehension for investing in these types of investments.\nWe expect challenging economic and operating conditions and an evolving regulatory regime to continue for the foreseeable future. These conditions could continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results for 2016. The degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions and the nature of new banking regulations.\nWhile our loan growth has continued to be strong, continued uncertainty and sluggish economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which would adversely impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in real estate values and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially. The systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries also may not function as we have anticipated.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The primary sources of funding for our Bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects a third party or us. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events. While we believe we have a healthy liquidity position, any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future.\nThe U.S. government continues to enact legislation and develop various programs and initiatives designed to stabilize the financial services industry, stabilize the housing markets and stimulate the economy. The banking industry is awaiting many of the regulations resulting from the implementation of the Financial Reform Act. We remain unsure of the full impact this legislation will have on our business, operations or our financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. Management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. These policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such judgments, assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Actual results, in fact, could differ from initial estimates.\nThe accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses, accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans, the fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities, accounting for economic hedging activities, accounting for impairment testing of goodwill, accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management's best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers. Unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, may impact our assessment of possible credit losses. As a part of its analysis, we use our historical losses, loss emergence experience and qualitative factors, such as levels of and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charged-off loans, changes in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience and ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of credit, competition, and loan review results to support estimates.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of the loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments. For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on class segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For purposes of this analysis, we categorize loans into one of five categories: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate (including construction), home equity lines of credit, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. We also maintain an allowance for loan losses for acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded at the time of acquisition.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we transitioned to using its historical loss experience and trends in losses for each category which were then adjusted for portfolio trends and economical and environmental factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. The indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied to each of the five categories of loans. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the allowance model used the average loss rates of similar institutions based on its custom peer group as a baseline, which was adjusted for its particular loan portfolio characteristics and environmental factors. These changes did not have an impact to the overall allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment. We individually assigns loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes, as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent. In certain cases, we apply, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, a 5% loss factor to all loans classified as special mention, a 15% loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a 50% loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful. Loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged-off. However, in most instances, we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis for those loans that are adversely risk rated. For these loans, we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and considers estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis. If the net collateral value is less than the loan balance (including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan) we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan. Because of the limited number of impaired loans within the portfolio, we are able to evaluate each impaired loan individually and therefore specific reserves for impaired loans are generally less than those recommended by the listed regulatory guidelines above.\nThe general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. To arrive at the general component, the loan portfolio is grouped by loan type. A weighted average historical loss rate is computed for each group of loans over the trailing seven year period. We selected a seven year evaluation period as a result of the limited historical loss experience we have incurred, even during the recent economic downturn. We also believe that a seven year time horizon represents a full economic cycle. The historical loss factors are updated at least annually, unless a more frequent review of such factors is warranted. In addition to the use of historical loss factors, a qualitative adjustment factor is applied. This qualitative adjustment factor, which may be favorable or unfavorable, represents management's judgment that inherent losses in a given group of loans are different from historical loss rates due to environmental factors unique to that specific group of loans. These factors may relate to growth rate factors within the particular loan group; whether the recent loss history for a particular group of loans differs from its historical loss rate; the amount of loans in a particular group that have recently been designated as impaired and that may be indicative of future trends for this group; reported or observed difficulties that other banks are having with loans in the particular group; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending personnel; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans; and changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and adversely classified loans. The sum of the historical loss rate and the qualitative adjustment factor comprise the estimated annual loss rate. To adjust for inherent loss levels within the loan portfolio, a loss emergence factor is estimated based on an evaluation of the period of time it takes for a loan within each of our loan segments to deteriorate to the point an impairment loss is recorded within the allowance. The loss emergence factor is applied to the estimated annual loss rate to determine the expected annual loss amount.\nCredit losses are an inherent part of our business and, although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are appropriate, it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment. Additional provisions for such losses, if necessary, would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments, as appropriate, and would negatively impact earnings.\nAllowance for Loan Losses-Acquired Loans\nAcquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30\nFor our acquired loans, to the extent that we experience a deterioration in borrower credit quality resulting in a decrease in our expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition of the loans, an allowance for loan losses would be established based on our estimate of future credit losses over the remaining life of the loans.\nAcquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-20\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, we establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation process that is similar to our evaluation process used for originated loans. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, carrying value of the loans, which includes the remaining net purchase discount or premium, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses.\nPurchased Credit-Impaired Loans\nPurchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which are the loans acquired in our acquisition of UFBC, are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). These loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no allowance for loan losses. We account for interest income on all loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality) based on the acquired loans' expected cash flows. The acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flow. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loans, or the \"accretable yield,\" is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses on these impaired pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (representing the present value of all cash flows that were expected at acquisition but currently are not expected to be received). At December 31, 2015, there was no reserve for impairment of PCI loans within our allowance for loan losses.\nWe periodically evaluate the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Changes in the contractual required payments due and estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and non-accretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. On an aggregate basis, if the acquired pools of PCI loans perform better than originally expected, we would expect to receive more future cash flows than originally modeled at the acquisition date. For the pools with better than expected cash flows, the forecasted increase would be recorded as an additional accretable yield that is recognized as a prospective increase to our interest income on loans.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Our investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry-wide valuation service. This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. For certain of our held-to-maturity investment securities where there is minimal observable trading activity, we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value based on internal calculations and compare our results to information provided by external pricing sources.\nWe also fair value our interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales commitments. The fair value of our interest rate lock commitments considers the expected premium (discount) to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan. In addition, we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination, and then period end, using applicable published mortgage-backed investment security prices. The fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date. At loan closing, the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is included in the cost basis of loans held for sale, which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.\nAccounting for Economic Hedging Activities\nWe record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For derivatives designated as hedges, we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness. We evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective. In situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contractual commitments, including rate lock commitments, to finance residential mortgage loans. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings.\nTo mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments, we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts. During the rate lock commitment period, these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value elements of the rate lock commitment related to servicing and the wholesale and retail rate spread, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. At the closing of the loan, the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract. The forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale. Loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.\nAccounting for Impairment Testing of Goodwill\nWe have adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-08 (\"ASU 2011-08\"), Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This ASU permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform the two-step impairment test. We perform our annual review of the goodwill during the third quarter.\nIn the event we are required to perform a Step 1 fair value evaluation of the reporting unit, we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit. This discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including: estimated future\ncash flows from operations; an estimate of a terminal value; a discount rate; and other inputs. Our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows. If the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nAccounting for the Impairment of Amortizing Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe continually review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable. We evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows, before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis, with the net book value of long-term assets, including amortizable intangible assets. If undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets, further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment.\nAn impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values. Fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods. When substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset, the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered. Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes.\nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-04, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure (\"ASU No. 2014-04\"), which clarifies when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. An in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs upon either the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Additionally, this ASU requires interim and annual disclosure of both the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. ASU No. 2014-04 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-04 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-01, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects (\"ASU No. 2014-01\"), which amends existing guidance to permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their\ninvestments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense or benefit. For those investments in qualified affordable housing projects not accounted for using the proportional amortization method, the investment should be accounted for as an equity method investment or a cost method investment in accordance with Subtopic 970-323. ASU No. 2014-01 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-01 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a framework that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, for public entities. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. This ASU changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. Additionally, for repurchase financing arrangements, the amendments of this ASU require separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. The requirements are effective for public entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2014. The disclosure of certain transactions accounted for as a sale is required to be presented for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and the disclosure for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as securities borrowings is required to be presented for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-01 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides an acquired entity an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. This ASU is effective for public business entities on November 18, 2014. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this guidance.\nFinancial Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $47.3 million on a consolidated basis. The commercial banking segment recorded net income of $39.2 million and our mortgage banking segment recorded net income of $9.2 million. The wealth management services business segment reported net income of $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income of $32.7 million on a consolidated basis. The commercial banking segment recorded net income of $34.4 million and our mortgage banking segment recorded a net loss of $2.7 million. The wealth management services business segment reported net income of $135,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nAt December 31, 2015, total assets were $4.03 billion, an increase of 18.6%, or $630.8 million, from $3.40 billion at December 31, 2014. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 18.4%, or $475.2 million, to $3.06 billion at December 31, 2015, from $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014. Total investment securities increased by $75.6 million, or 21.7%, to $423.8 million\nat December 31, 2015, from $348.2 million at December 31, 2014. Total deposits increased 19.6%, or $497.4 million, to $3.03 billion at December 31, 2015, from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014. Other borrowed funds, which primarily include customer repurchase agreements, federal funds sold and Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances, increased $100.0 million to $538.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $438.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $413.1 million, an increase of $35.8 million from $377.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $47.3 million less dividends paid to shareholders totaling $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased shareholders' equity $3.1 million during 2015. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively. Book value per share at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12.76 and $11.76, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.37% at December 31, 2015 compared to 11.78% at December 31, 2014. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded net income of $47.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $32.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, in 2014. Net interest income increased $8.7 million to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a result of increase in interest earning assets. Provision for loan losses was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.9 million for 2014. Non-interest income increased $13.5 million to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $39.2 million for 2014 due primarily to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking business segment. Non-interest expense was $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase in salaries and benefits expense during 2015 was offset by a decrease in merger and acquisition expense as we added to the sales and operational staffing areas of the Company over the past year as a result of our continued growth and increased regulatory environment in addition to an increase in the variable component of compensation expense.\nThe return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 1.29% and 1.02%, respectively. The return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 11.76% and 8.82%, respectively.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nAt December 31, 2014, total assets were $3.40 billion, an increase of 17.5%, or $504.9 million, from $2.89 billion at December 31, 2013. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 26.5%, or $540.9 million, to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.04 billion at December 31, 2013. Total investment securities decreased by $11.5 million, or 3.2%, to $348.2 million at December 31, 2014, from $359.7 million at December 31, 2013. Total deposits increased 23.1%, or $476.5 million, to $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2013. Other borrowed funds decreased $37.2 million to $438.0 million at December 31, 2014, from $475.2 million at December 31, 2013.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 was $377.3 million, an increase of $56.8 million from $320.5 million at December 31, 2013. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the shares issued as a result of our acquisition of UFBC. For each share of UFBC common stock outstanding, the shareholders of UFBC received a fixed exchange ratio of $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our\ncommon stock. We issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and added $25.2 million in additional paid in capital for a total of $26.8 million in additional capital. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income added $5.3 million in capital offset by dividends paid to common shareholders of $10.9 million during 2014. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11.1%. Book value per share at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.76 and $10.57, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.78% at December 31, 2014 compared to 12.89% at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2014.\nWe recorded net income of $32.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net income of $25.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, in 2013. Net interest income increased $15.4 million to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a result of increase in interest earning assets and strategically decreasing the rates we pay on our deposits. Provision for loan losses was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a benefit of $32,000 for 2013. Non-interest income increased $9.3 million to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $29.9 million for 2013 due primarily to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking business segment. Non-interest expense was $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.6 million, or 13.7%, compared to $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expense, occupancy expense, and expenses attributable to our acquisition of UFBC.\nThe return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 1.02% and 0.92% , respectively. The return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 8.82% and 7.96%, respectively.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. It represents non-interest expense as a percentage of net interest income and non-interest income. The lower the percentage, the more efficient we are operating. We believe use of the efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides additional clarity in assessing our operating results.\nSee the table below for the components of our calculation of our efficiency ratio as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Our efficiency ratio decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014 because of a combined increase in net interest income and non-interest income, specifically income related to our mortgage banking business segment, while maintaining non-interest expense during 2015 at the same level as for 2014.\nEfficiency Ratio Calculation\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Calculation of efficiency ratio(1):\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>116,394 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>107,700 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>92,345 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,911 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net interest income and non-interest income for efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>65.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>69.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Efficiency ratio is calculated as total non-interest expense divided by the total of net interest income and non-interest income\nStatements of Income\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue, representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates. Interest rates have remained at historic lows for the last several years as the Federal Reserve has had an extremely accommodative policy. We expect this low interest rate environment to discontinue during 2016 as the Federal Reserve has begun to gradually increase the targeted federal funds rate with its first rate increase of 0.25% in nearly a decade in December 2015.

</tr>\n</table>\n(1)Non-accrual loans are included in average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield. Interest income on non-accruing loans was not material for the years presented.\n(2)Interest income for loans receivable and investment securities available-for-sale is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis at a rate of 34% for 2015 and 33% for 2014.\n(3)Changes attributable to rate/volume have been allocated to volume.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $116.4 million, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $8.7 million, or 8.1%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase in the volume of interest-earning assets during 2015 compared to 2014. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 23 basis points to 4.06% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 4.29% for the same period of 2014. To offset this decrease in yield, during the first quarter of 2015, we reduced our wholesale funding costs related to other borrowed funds by 30 basis points as we restructured a portion of our fixed rate FHLB advance portfolio. This restructuring reduced our FHLB advance funding costs from 3.33% to 2.80%.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 3.37% and 3.59%, respectively. The decrease in our net interest margin was primarily a result\nof a decrease in the yields on our interest-earning assets partially offset by a slight decrease in the costs related to our interest-bearing liabilities during 2015. Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, is a financial measure that we believe provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use our federal statutory tax rates for the periods presented. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.06% in 2015 from 4.29% in 2014. Total average earning assets increased by 15.5% to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.04 billion at December 31, 2014 which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $12.1 million to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $130.3 million 2014. The increase in our earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in average loans receivable of $397.3 million, which contributed to an additional $17.5 million in interest income on a tax equivalent basis for 2015. This increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio which decreased interest income $6.4 million on a tax equivalent basis. The increase in loans receivable during 2015 was attributable to organic growth. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2015 and 2014. Additional interest income of approximately $201,000 for 2015 and $866,000 for 2014 would have been realized had all nonperforming loans performed as originally expected. Nonperforming loans exclude those loans that are both past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest due to an assessment of collectibility.\nAs a result of the significant increase in loan origination activity that occurred at George Mason during 2015, average balances for loans held for sale increased $56.2 million to $344.5 million and resulted in an increase in interest income from loans held for sale of $1.1 million to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 201. The increase in outstanding balances in the loans held for sale portfolio during 2015 contributed to the increase in other borrowed funds as we use wholesale funding in the form of brokered certificates of deposits and FHLB advances to help fund this loan portfolio.\nTotal average interest-bearing deposits increased $361.7 million to $2.21 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.85 billion at December 31, 2014. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $65.1 million to $619.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $553.9 million at December 31, 2014. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our certificates of deposit, which increased $261.2 million compared to 2014. Average brokered certificates of deposit increased $120.9 million during 2015. This change in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities increased our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.73% in 2015 from 0.66% in 2014. The cost of other borrowed funds, which generally are shorter term fundings used to help fund our balance sheet growth and support our loans held for sale portfolio, decreased 30 basis points to 2.00% in 2015 from 2.30% in 2014, a result of the aforementioned FHLB advance restructuring we completed during the first quarter of 2015. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 3 basis points to 0.92% in 2015 from 0.95% in 2014 as a result of the aforementioned changes in funding sources.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $107.7 million, compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $15.4 million, or 16.6%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of the interest-earning assets we acquired from UFBC in addition to the organic growth that occurred during 2014. We also continued to strategically decrease rates on our deposit products as a result of the low interest rate environment during 2014.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 3.59% and 3.52%, respectively. The increase in our net interest margin was primarily a result of a decrease in the yields on our interest-bearing liabilities offset partially by a slight decrease in the yields over our interest-earning assets.\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.29% in 2014 from 4.33% in 2013. Total average earning assets increased by 14.4% to $3.04 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $2.66 billion at December 31, 2013 which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $15.1 million to $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $115.2 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in our earnings assets was primarily driven by an increase in average loans receivable of $516.7 million, which contributed to an additional $23.3 million in interest income on a tax equivalent basis for 2014. This increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio which decreased interest income $5.2 million on a tax equivalent basis. The increase in loans receivable during 2014 was a combination of loans acquired of $238.3 million during the year with the remaining increase in loans attributable to organic growth. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2014 and 2013. Additional interest income of approximately $866,000 for 2014 and $626,000 for 2013 would have been realized had all nonperforming loans performed as originally expected.\nAs a result of the significant decrease in loan origination activity that occurred at George Mason during 2014, average balances for loans held for sale decreased $118.4 million to $288.3 million and resulted in a decrease in interest income from loans held for sale of $4.5 million to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result of the decrease in our loans held for sale portfolio, we invested the excess cash (which was earning 0.25% in federal funds sold) through purchases of $47.7 million in investment securities during 2014. The decrease in outstanding balances in the loans held for sale portfolio during 2014 contributed to the decrease in other borrowed funds.\nTotal average interest-bearing deposits increased $142.4 million to $1.85 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $1.71 billion at December 31, 2013. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $139.8 million to $553.9 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $414.2 million at December 31, 2013. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our interest checking, which increased $52.8 million compared to 2013. Average brokered certificates of deposit decreased $27.3 million during 2014. These changes in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities assisted in us decreasing our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.66% in 2014 from 0.76% in 2013. The cost of other borrowed funds, decreased 68 basis points to 2.30% in 2014 from 2.98% in 2013, a result of our paying off certain FHLB advances at maturity as the loans held for sale portfolio decreased. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 14 basis points to 0.95% in 2014 from 1.09% in 2013 as a result of the aforementioned changes in funding sources.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk. Our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk. Management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain. We manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee (\"ALCO\"). ALCO is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management.\nWe employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity. We use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity. Many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are\ndeveloped for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the current balance sheet, the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions, the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged. This is considered the base case. Next, the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down 100 basis points and up 200 basis points. The down 200 basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates. In the ramped down rate change, the model moves rates gradually down 100 basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year.\nFor the up 200 basis point scenario, rates are gradually moved up 200 basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year. In both the up and down scenarios, the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case.\nAt December 31, 2015, our asset/liability position was slightly asset sensitive based on our interest rate sensitivity model. Our net interest income would decrease by less than 1.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 2.0% in an up 200 basis point scenario over a one-year time frame. In the two-year time horizon, our net interest income would decrease by less than 2.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 2.9% in an up 200 basis point scenario.\nProvision Expense and Allowance for Loan Losses\nOur policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers.\nWe recorded a provision of $1.4 million for our loan loss provisioning for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was $31.7 million compared to $28.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our allowance for loan loss ratio as a percent of total loans at December 31, 2015 was 1.04% compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2014. The decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is a result of improved credit quality during 2015.\nDuring 2015 the credit quality in our loan portfolio remained strong, as we have experienced decreases in our nonperforming assets as compared to historical periods and net recoveries as we work out our problem credits. During 2014, our level of nonperforming assets increased as we acquired several impaired loans that were held within the UFBC loan portfolio. These impaired loans had been on nonaccrual status prior to the acquisition date or had demonstrated that there was with limited possibility for improvement and therefore we placed such loans on nonaccrual. The decrease in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 was a result of three nonperforming loans paying off in total and selling three nonperforming loan relationships. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded charge-offs of $291,000 related to commercial, residential and consumer loans. Recoveries from previously charged-off loans totaled $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, most of which were related to commercial loans. Of the recoveries recorded, one was previously a troubled debt restructuring.\nAnnualized net loan recoveries was 0.07% of average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to annualized net loan charge-offs of 0.06% of average loans receivable\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014. Nonaccrual loans (less interest and credit marks assigned to PCI loans) totaled $451,000 at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nA sluggish job market and declining home values could adversely affect our home equity lines of credit, credit card and other loan portfolios, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. At December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate portfolio (including construction lending) portfolio was 67.8% of our total loan portfolio. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our business, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level or our credit exposure to individual entities and industries, may not function as we have anticipated.\nThe provision for loan losses was a benefit of $32,000 for 2013. We recorded net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaling $496,000.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Policies\" above for more information on our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nThe following tables present additional information pertaining to the activity in and allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type and the percentage of the loan type to the total loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities, investment fee income, and gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and continues to be an important factor in our operating results. Non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $52.7 million and $39.2 million, respectively.\nThe increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014, is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking segment. Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased $11.4 million to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $32.1 million for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $43.5 million, which was comprised of $39.7 million in realized gains and a $3.8 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $32.1 million, which was comprised of $28.7 million in realized gains and a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. In addition to the increase in origination activity, the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities was impacted by an increase in gain on sale margins during 2015 as compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed $3.6 billion in mortgage originations compared to $3.0 billion in 2014. Refinance activity represented approximately 31% of the originations during 2015, an increase from 21% experienced during 2014.\nIn accordance with GAAP, if a lender enters into a mortgage loan commitment with a customer and intends to sell the mortgage loan after it is funded, the written loan commitment is to be accounted for as a derivative instrument and is to be recorded at fair value through earnings. George Mason enters into commitments where individual loans are \"locked in\" at a specified interest rate for a\nfixed period. At the time of commitment, George Mason also enters into a \"best efforts\" forward contract with an investor to sell the loan at an agreed upon price if, and after, the loan is closed. This price represents the fair value of the \"interest rate lock commitment\" (IRLC) and is an unrealized gain that is included in earnings during the period of the IRLC. This gain is also recognized earlier in earnings than the expenses associated with originating, underwriting and closing the loan, which, under GAAP, are recognized and deferred by the Company at the time of loan sale to the investor. When the loan actually closes, the unrealized gain is added to the basis of the ensuing loan held for sale (LHFS). At any point in time (e.g. quarter end) the fair value of the existing IRLCs (not yet closed) and the premium to the basis of existing LHFS (loans closed but not yet purchased by investors) represent unrealized gains that have been recognized in income, either in the current period or prior periods. At the time the loan is sold to investors, the \"investor buy price\" is equal to the basis of the loan held for sale, and there is no gain or loss recognized. This accounting creates a mismatch between the income recognition on loan production and the expense recognition for those same loans. Direct costs associated with the loan origination, such as commissions and salaries, are recorded as a reduction to realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities.\nMaintaining our revenue stream in the mortgage banking segment is dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors at or near current volumes. Over the last several years, we have increased our mortgage banking presence to include the Richmond and Virginia Beach areas of the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by less refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our net income.\nInvestment fee income decreased $227,000 to $489,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $716,000 for 2014. Investment fee income includes net commissions earned at CWS during 2015 and 2014.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $124,000 to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Service charges on deposit accounts include insufficient funds fee income, service charges on deposit accounts, other fee income on deposit accounts and ATM transaction fees as shown in the table above. Loan fees totaled $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $399,000, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in loan fee income is a result of a decrease in prepayment penalties during 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, income from bank-owned life insurance was $433,000, a decrease of $50,000 when compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease is a result of the decrease in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank-owned life insurance.\nWe recorded trading gains of $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to trading gains of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have purchased investments to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability. These investments are designated as trading securities, and as such, the changes in fair value are reflected in earnings. These trading gains were primarily the result of increased stock prices and were mostly offset by a compensation expense associated with this benefit plan.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded gains on the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million.\nDuring 2015, we recorded a litigation settlement of $3.0 million which also contributed to the increase in noninterest income for 2015.\nNon-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $39.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively. The increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the same period of 2013, is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking segment. Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased $10.4 million to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $21.6 million for 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $32.1 million, which was comprised of $28.7 million in realized gains and a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $21.6 million, which was comprised of $36.7 million in realized gains and a $15.1 million decrease in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we closed $3.0 billion in mortgage originations compared to $5.8 billion in 2013. Refinance activity represented approximately 21% of the originations during 2014, a decrease from 33% experienced during 2013.\nThe increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is a result of the increase in gain on sale margins we experienced during 2014 as compared to 2013. In addition, the change in the unrealized portion of our gains on loan sales was an increase of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a decrease of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nManagement fee income, which represented the income earned for services George Mason provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders and generally fluctuated based on the volume of loan sales, decreased to $21,000 during 2014 compared to $2.0 million in 2013. The decrease in management fee income is a result of the discontinuation of all of our remaining managed company relationships within the last year.\nInvestment fee income decreased $621,000 to $716,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1.3 million for 2013. Investment fee income includes net commissions earned at CWS during 2014 and for 2013, income earned at Wilson/Bennett and from our trust division prior to the completion of the aforementioned wealth management reorganization as of June 30, 2013.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $178,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Loan fees totaled $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $548,000, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Title insurance and other income totaled $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $987,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in title insurance and other income is primarily a result of our closing George Mason's title company as new regulations impaired our ability to maintain a level of profitability within this subsidiary.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, income from bank-owned life insurance was $483,000, an decrease of $72,000 when compared to the same period of 2013. The increase is a result of the increase in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank-owned life insurance.\nWe recorded trading gains of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to trading gains of $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded gains on the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table reflects the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salary and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>51,844 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>45,963 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing and communications\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance assessments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loan repurchases and settlements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank franchise taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of pooled trust preferred securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger and acquisition expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premises and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stationary and supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Travel and entertainment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Miscellaneous\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,283 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>96,298 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>96,228 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>84,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest expense includes, among other things, salaries and benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, depreciation, data processing, telecommunications and miscellaneous expenses. Non-interest expense was $96.3 million and $96.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $5.8 million to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $46.0 million for 2014. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily related to increases in our business development personnel in our commercial banking and mortgage banking segments. We added commercial lenders at the Bank and increased back office staffing levels due to our increased regulatory environment. In addition, the variable component of our compensation expense increased during 2015 as a result of our 2015 performance.\nOccupancy expense decreased $480,000 to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $10.3 million for 2014. The decrease in occupancy expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the closing of several branch office locations during 2014 and one in 2015. As a result of our UFBC acquisition, we had five branch offices that overlapped existing markets. Decreases in depreciation expense of $324,000, data processing and communications of $840,000, and merger and acquisitions expense of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 can be attributed to the acquisition of UFBC during 2014 and the cost savings we received post acquisition.\nProfessional fees increased $1.5 million to $4.6 million for 2015 compared to $3.1 million for 2014. The increase in professional fees during 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees as a result of litigation which was settled during the second quarter of 2015 and an increase in external audit and accounting fees from prior year's engagement.\nAdvertising and marketing expense decreased $906,000 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5.1 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease in marketing and advertising expense was a result of the branch expansion that occurred during 2014 as a result of branch acquisitions and de novo growth. No similar expansion occurred during 2015.\nMortgage loan repurchases and settlements for 2015 was $397,000 compared to $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to one settlement related to the previous financial crisis. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to limit our exposure to loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors. Given the steps that have been taken to limit our exposure coupled with the passage of time and the expiration of the statute of limitations for loans originated in certain prior years, our current expectation is that future putback claims will be limited in number. We evaluate the individual merits of each claim, and recognize an expense when settlement is deemed probable and the amount of such a settlement is estimable.\nNon-interest expense was $96.2 million and $84.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $11.6 million, or 13.7%. The increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily the result of increases in salary and benefits costs, occupancy expense, and expenses related to the acquisition of UFBC during 2014.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $4.4 million to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $41.5 million for 2013. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily related to increases in our business development personnel in our commercial banking and mortgage banking segments. We added commercial lenders at the Bank and opened one de novo banking offices during 2014. In addition, the variable component of our compensation expense increased during 2014 as a result of our 2014 performance.\nOccupancy expense increased $1.9 million to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $8.4 million for 2013. The increase in occupancy expense during 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage origination offices and acquired and de novo banking offices as we strategically increase our market share. Data processing and communications expense increased $1.7 million to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.7 million, a result of the aforementioned increase in locations.\nProfessional fees decreased $643,000 to $3.1 million for 2014 compared to $3.8 million for 2013. The decrease in professional fees during 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to a decrease in temporary staffing that was allocated to George Mason to handle the increase in loan origination volume during the 2013 refinance boom. The level of temporary staffing was maintained at George Mason until the beginning of the third quarter of 2013 when loan origination volume dropped significantly due to the current mortgage market conditions.\nAdvertising and marketing expense increased slightly by $376,000 to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $4.7 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in marketing and advertising expense was a result of the branch expansion that occurred during 2014 as a result of branch acquisitions and de novo growth.\nMortgage loan repurchases and settlements for 2014 was $83,000 compared to a benefit of $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nMerger and acquisition expense was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $464,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of our acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. Merger and acquisition related expenses primarily include expenses related to staff reductions, branch office consolidations, contract termination payments and back office systems consolidations.\nWe recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment of $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of the issuance of the Final Rules required by the Financial Reform Act which were released by federal banking agencies in late 2013. The impairment recorded brought the book value of these investments in line with their fair value as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we have recorded in full the impairment loss recorded in 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2015 was 33.7%, compared to 32.9% for 2014. Our effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate because of income we receive on tax-exempt investments and tax credits we have related to low income housing investments.\nWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2013 was 32.3%. See also \"Critical Accounting Policies-Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\".\nStatements of Condition\nLoans Receivable, Net\nTotal loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $3.06 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $475.2 million, or 18.4%, compared to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014. Loans held for sale increased $68.4 million to $383.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $315.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in our inventory of loans held for sale during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the significant increase in loan origination and sales volume, a result of increases in loan originators during 2015 in addition to preferential market conditions during 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (less interest and credit marks for PCI loans) totaling $451,000. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014 totaled $3.4 million. We had no accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. During 2015, our level of nonperforming loans decreased as a result of three nonperforming loans paying off in total and selling three nonperforming loan relationships. Loans that are classified as \"troubled debt restructurings\" at December 31, 2015 totaled $365,000 compared to $289,000 at December 31, 2014.\nInterest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded when cash is received. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income if it was accrued in the current year and is charged to the allowance for loan losses if it was accrued in prior years. While on nonaccrual, the collection of interest is recorded as interest income only after all past-due principal has been collected. When all past contractual obligations are collected and, in our opinion, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to remain current, the loan is returned to an accruing status. At December 31, 2015, the loans on nonaccrual status did not have a valuation allowance. Gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonaccrual loans had been current with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $201,000 and $8666,000, respectively. The interest income realized prior to loans being placed on nonaccrual status for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6,000 and $80,000, respectively.\nTotal loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $540.9 million, or 26.5%, compared to $2.04 billion at December 31, 2013. Loans held for sale decreased $58.7 million to $315.3 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $374.0 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease in our inventory of loans held for sale during 2014 compared to 2013\nis primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination and sales volume, as mortgage rates have increased as a result of market concerns over the ending of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, which had kept interest rate at historic lows.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis totaling $3.4 million (less interest and credit marks for PCI loans). Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2013 totaled $2.3 million. We had no accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. During 2014, our level of nonperforming loans increased as we acquired several impaired loans that were held within the UFBC loan portfolio. These impaired loans had been on nonaccrual status prior to the acquisition date or had demonstrated that there was limited possibility for improvement and therefore we placed such loans on nonaccrual during 2014. Loans that are classified as \"troubled debt restructurings\" at December 31, 2014 totaled $289,000 compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2012.\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.02%, 0.17%, and 0.11% at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe following tables present the composition of our loans receivable portfolio at the end of each of the five years ended December 31, 2015 and additional information on nonperforming loans receivable.\nLoans Receivable\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

Securities\nOur investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity. The investment portfolio consists of investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities held-to-maturity and trading securities. Investment securities available-for-sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability strategy, liquidity management or regulatory capital management. Investment securities held-to-maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Investment securities-trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability. These securities include cash equivalents, equities and mutual funds. Investment securities were $423.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $75.6 million or 21.7%, from $348.2 million at December 31, 2014. We purchased $144.0 million in investment securities during 2015 as a result of an excess cash position we had at the Bank and to help enhance our net interest margin by investing in higher yielding earning assets.\nOf the $423.8 million in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, $3.8 million were classified as held-to-maturity, $414.1 million were classified as available-for-sale, and $5.9 million were\nclassified as trading securities. At December 31, 2015, the yield on the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 3.20% and the yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.19%.\nWe complete reviews for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2015, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency. Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk. At December 31, 2015, 99% of our mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).\nWe have $947,000 in non-government non-agency mortgage-backed securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. The various protective elements on the non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes, which could impact the ratings of these securities.\nAt December 31, 2015, certain of our investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position. Investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. Contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government. Other mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due. We do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.\nAt December 31, 2015, we owned two pooled trust preferred securities classified as held-to-maturity. The par and carrying values of these securities were each $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. The collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions. We own the A-3 tranches in each issuance. Each of the bonds is rated by more than one rating agency. One security has a composite rating of AA and the other security has a composite rating of A. Observable trading activity remains limited for these types of securities. We have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services. Given the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches, and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral, we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the securities, and concluded that these securities are not other-than-temporarily impaired. We continuously monitor the financial condition of the underlying issues and the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches. We also utilize a multi-scenario model which assumes varying levels of additional defaults and deferrals and the effects of such adverse developments on the contractual cash flows for the A-3 tranches. In each of the adverse scenarios, there was no indication of a break to the A-3 contractual cash flows.\nNo other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized for the securities in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe hold $18.1 million in FHLB stock at December 31, 2015 which is included in other investments on the statement of condition.\nInvestment securities were $348.2 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.5 million or 3.2%, from $359.7 million at December 31, 2013. We purchased $48.0 million in investment securities during 2014 as a result of an excess cash position we had at the Bank due to the decrease in our loans held for sale portfolio.\nOf the $348.2 million in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2014, $4.0 million were classified as held-to-maturity, $339.1 million were classified as available-for-sale, and $5.1 million were classified as trading securities. At December 31, 2014, the yield on the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 3.44% and the yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.13%.\nThe following table reflects the composition of the

Funds\nTotal deposits were $3.03 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $497.4 million, or 19.6%, from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in total deposits during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to our deposit gathering efforts and in increase in wholesale deposit fundings during 2015. We have had success in attracting deposit balances from customers seeking to deposit their money with smaller, local banks and depositors are increasing balances held with financial institutions as a result of the increased protection of their money by the FDIC.\nWe use short term brokered CDs to assist us in funding our loans held for sale portfolio. Brokered certificates of deposit increased to $407.0 million at December 31, 2015, of which $67.0 million were placed in the CDARS program. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service (\"CDARS\"). CDARS allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit. When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, funds are placed into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. Brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2014 were $310.4 million, of which $32.3 million were in the CDARS program.\nOther borrowed funds, which primarily include federal funds purchased, customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and our payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, were $538.0 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $100.0 million, from $438.0 million at December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the increase in other borrowed funds at December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $115.0 million to $355.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $240.0 million at December 31, 2013. These advances were primarily used to assist in funding loans receivable originations at the Bank during 2015.\nOther borrowed funds at each of December 31, 2015 and 2014, included $20.6 million payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, the issuer of our trust preferred securities. This debt had an interest rate of 2.91% and 2.64% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated entity as we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust.\nIn connection with the UFBC acquisition, we acquired all of the voting and common shares of UFBC Capital Trust I (the \"UFBC Trust\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary established for the sole purpose of issuing $5.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. These trust preferred securities are due in 2035 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.10%, which adjusts quarterly. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the interest rate on trust preferred securities was 2.61% and 2.34%, respectively. The UFBC Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary since we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity.\nAt December 31, 2015, other borrowed funds also included $113.6 million in customer repurchase agreements compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2014. Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2015 was $45.0 million compared to $70.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table reflects the short-term borrowings and other borrowed funds outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Other Borrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2015\n(In thousands)\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Advance\nDate </th> <th> </th> <th>Term of\nAdvance </th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity or\nCall Date </th> <th> </th> <th>Interest\nRate </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount\nOutstanding </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Dec-15 </td> <td> </td> <td>1 month </td> <td> </td> <td>Jan-16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total short-term FHLB advances and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other short-term borrowed funds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer repurchase agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Funds Purchased\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other short-term borrowed funds and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>158,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowed funds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust preferred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances-long term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>330,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowed funds and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>354,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other borrowed funds and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>537,965 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits were $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $476.5 million, or 23.1%, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase in total deposits during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due the deposits we acquired in our acquisition of UFBC of $295.2 million, and $64.6 million in deposits from a branch office acquisition in Gainesville, Virginia, in addition to organic growth that occurred during the year.

performance. Our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence.\nRegulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution. The guidelines define capital as both Tier 1 (which includes common shareholders' equity, defined to include certain debt obligations) and Tier 2 (to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and 45% of unrealized gains in equity securities).\nOn January 1, 2015, the new Basel III regulatory risk-based capital rules became effective. Basel III includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refines the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, which is increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the current rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.\nThis new regulatory standard also provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets related to temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.\nBasel III prescribes a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $413.1 million, an increase of $35.8 million, compared to $377.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $47.3 million less dividends paid to shareholders of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3.1 million during 2015. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively. Book value per share at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12.76 and $11.76, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.37% at December 31, 2015 compared to 11.78% at December 31, 2014 (which was calculated under the previous regulatory capital rules). Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 was $377.3 million, an increase of $56.8 million, compared to $320.5 million at December 31, 2013. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the shares issued as a result of our acquisition of UFBC. For each share of UFBC common stock outstanding, the shareholders of UFBC received a fixed exchange ratio of $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our common stock. We issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and added $25.2 million in additional paid in capital for a total of $26.8 million in additional capital. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income added $5.3 million in capital offset by dividends paid to common shareholders of $10.9 million during 2014. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11.1%. Book value per share at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.76 and $10.57, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.78% at\nDecember 31, 2014 compared to 12.89% at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2014.\nAs noted above, regulatory capital levels for the bank and bank holding company meet those established for \"well-capitalized\" institutions. While we are currently considered \"well-capitalized,\" we may from time-to-time find it necessary to access the capital markets to meet our growth objectives or capitalize on specific business opportunities.\nThe following table shows the minimum capital requirement and our capital position at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 for the Company and for the Bank.\nCapital Components\nAt

We must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non-cash items into cash. The objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations, personal service and pricing.\nIn addition to deposits, we have access to the different wholesale funding markets. These markets include the brokered CD market, the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Services (\"CDARS\"). CDARS allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit through our Bank. When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, we place their funds into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. We also maintain secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged. Having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding.\nCash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers.\nWe have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management. For our liquidity management program, we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion. We also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. We believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled $453.4 million at December 31, 2015, or 11.3% of total assets. We held investments that are classified as held-to-maturity in the amount of $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. To maintain ready access to the Bank's secured lines of credit, the Bank has pledged roughly half of its investment securities and a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial & industrial loan portfolios pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at December 31, 2015 was approximately $678.5 million. Borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was approximately $164.8 million at December 31, 2015. These facilities are subject to the FHLB and the Federal Reserve approving disbursement to us. In addition, we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of $315 million available to us. We anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors, provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into a number of long-term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities. These contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us and exclude contractual interest costs, where applicable.\nThe required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2015\n(In thousands)\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due by Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>776,413 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>356,056 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>334,361 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>57,297 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,699 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust preferred securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,889 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,599,026 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>629,400 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>690,765 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>154,889 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>123,972 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Credit Risk\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.\nThe Bank's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include deposits\nheld by us, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business.\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. We hold certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.\nA summary of the contract amount of the Bank's exposure to off-balance-sheet risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, is as follows:\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,480,407 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,517,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments to extend credit of $247.4 million as of December 31, 2015 were related to George Mason's mortgage loan funding commitments and were of a short-term nature. Commitments to extend credit of $1.2 billion primarily have floating rates as of December 31, 2015. It is uncertain as to the amount that we will be required to fund on these commitments as many such arrangements expire with no amount drawn.\nWe have counter-party risk which may arise from the possible inability of George Mason's third-party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts. George Mason works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk. We do not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation. We continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties. We do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations.\nGeorge Mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities. We evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims. We have taken steps to limit our exposure to such loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors. As a result, we received a limited number of additional claims.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, George Mason settled with investors on such loans for a total of $0 and $194,000, respectively. This reserve had a balance of $500,000 and $150,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expense (benefit) related to this reserve for the years ended December 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $397,000, $83,000, and ($49,000), respectively.\nQuarterly Data\nThe following table provides quarterly data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following presents management's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nCaution About Forward-Looking Statements\nWe make certain forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals. The words \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including:\n\u2022 the risks of changes in interest rates on levels, composition and costs of deposits, loan demand, and the values and liquidity of loan collateral, securities, and interest sensitive assets and liabilities;\n\u2022 changes in assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible loan losses, reserves for repurchases of mortgage loans sold and other estimates;\n\u2022 changes in market conditions, specifically declines in the residential and commercial real estate market, volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, soundness of other financial institutions we do business with;\n\u2022 decrease in the volume of loan originations at our mortgage banking subsidiary as a result of the cyclical nature of mortgage banking, changes in interest rates, economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market which would negatively impact the income recorded on the sales of loans held for sale.\n\u2022 risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values;\n\u2022 declines in the prices of assets and market illiquidity may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment or other losses, specifically in our pooled trust preferred\nsecurities portfolio resulting from increases in underlying issuers' defaulting or deferring payments;\n\u2022 changes in operations within the wealth management services segment, its customer base and assets under management;\n\u2022 changes in operations of George Mason Mortgage, LLC as a result of the activity in the residential real estate market and any associated impact on the fair value of goodwill in the future;\n\u2022 legislative and regulatory changes, including the Financial Reform Act and implementation of the Volcker Rule, and other changes in banking, securities, and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators, and changes in scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverages;\n\u2022 exposure to repurchase loans sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor;\n\u2022 the risks of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including, without limitation, the related time and costs of implementing such transactions, integrating operations as part of these transactions and possible failures to achieve expected gains, revenue growth and/or expense savings from such transactions;\n\u2022 the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies as we implement new or change internal operating systems or if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future;\n\u2022 the effects of future economic, business and market conditions;\n\u2022 governmental monetary and fiscal policies;\n\u2022 changes in accounting policies, rules and practices;\n\u2022 maintaining cost controls and asset quality as we open or acquire new branches;\n\u2022 maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth;\n\u2022 reliance on our management team, including our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022 competition with other banks and financial institutions, and companies outside of the banking industry, including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources;\n\u2022 demand, development and acceptance of new products and services;\n\u2022 problems with technology utilized by us;\n\u2022 changing trends in customer profiles and behavior; and\n\u2022 other factors described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC.\nBecause of these uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results.\nIn addition, this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A above.\nOverview\nWe are a financial holding company formed in 1997 and headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia. We were formed principally in response to opportunities resulting from the consolidation of several Virginia-based banks. These bank consolidations were typically accompanied by the dissolution of local boards of directors and relocation or termination of management and customer service professionals and a general deterioration of personalized customer service.\nOn January 16, 2014, we announced the completion of our acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. (\"UFBC\"), the holding company of The Business Bank (\"TBB\"), pursuant to a previously announced definitive merger agreement. The merger of UFBC into Cardinal was effective January 16, 2014. Under the terms of the merger agreement, UFBC shareholders received $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our common stock in exchange for each share of UFBC common stock they owned immediately prior to the merger. TBB, which was headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, merged into Cardinal Bank effective March 8, 2014.\nWe own Cardinal Bank (the \"Bank\"), a Virginia state-chartered community bank with 31 banking offices located in Northern Virginia and the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers. Our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors, commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals, such as physicians, accountants and attorneys.\nAdditionally, we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries, including mortgage banking through George Mason Mortgage, LLC (\"George Mason\") and retail securities brokerage though Cardinal Wealth Services, Inc. (\"CWS\").\nPrior to June 30, 2013, the Bank had a trust division, Cardinal Trust and Investment Services. This division merged its remaining operations as of June 30, 2013 into CWS. In addition, as of June 30, 2013, Wilson/Bennett Capital Management, Inc., formerly the Company's second nonbank subsidiary, merged its operations into CWS. During the second quarter of 2013, we exited the third party institutional custody and trustee component of our trust services division due to our limited opportunity to leverage this platform. As a result of our reorganization of the wealth management business segment, the remaining personal and commercial trust area of this business consolidated into CWS. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries.\nWe had a second mortgage subsidiary, Cardinal First Mortgage, LLC (\"Cardinal First\") based in Fairfax, Virginia, but as of June 30, 2013, this subsidiary merged into George Mason to improve operational efficiency. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries.\nGeorge Mason, based in Fairfax, Virginia, engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through 17 offices located throughout the metropolitan Washington region. George Mason does business in eight states, primarily Virginia and Maryland, and the District of Columbia. George Mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, generating originations of approximately $3.6 billion in 2015 and $3.0 billion in 2014. George Mason's primary sources of revenue include loan origination fees, net interest income earned on loans held for sale, and gains on sales of loans. At the time we enter into an interest rate lock arrangement with the borrower, we enter into a loan forward sale commitment with a third party. Our mortgage loans are then sold servicing released.\nGeorge Mason also offers a construction-to-permanent loan program. This program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences. Once the home has been completed, the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market. These\nconstruction-to-permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for George Mason and are classified as loans held for sale.\nThe mortgage banking segment's business is both cyclical and seasonal. The cyclical nature of its business is influenced by, among other factors, the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates, national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy. Historically, the mortgage banking segment has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year. However, the decrease in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2015 increased refinancing activity for George Mason as it did for other mortgage banking entities, and contributed to our increased loan origination activity for the full 2015 year as compared to 2014.\nWilson/Bennett provided asset management services to certain of our customers. Wilson/Bennett's primary source of revenue was management fees earned on the assets it managed for its customers. These management fees were generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets. As part of our reorganization of the wealth management services business segment, we merged Wilson/Bennett operations into CWS as of June 30, 2013.\nWe formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Cardinal Statutory Trust I, for the purpose of issuing $20.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (\"trust preferred securities\"). These trust preferred securities are due in 2034 and pay interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 2.40%, which adjusts quarterly. These securities are redeemable at par. The interest rate on this debt was 2.91% at December 31, 2015. We have guaranteed payment of these securities. The $20.6 million payable by us to Cardinal Statutory Trust I is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity. We utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the Bank.\nIn connection with the UFBC acquisition, we acquired all of the voting and common shares of UFBC Capital Trust I (the \"UFBC Trust\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary established for the sole purpose of issuing $5.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. These trust preferred securities are due in 2035 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.10%, which adjusts quarterly. At December 31, 2015, the interest rate on trust preferred securities was 2.61%. The UFBC Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary since we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity. The additional $155,000 that is payable by us to the UFBC Trust represents the unfunded capital investment in the UFBC Trust.\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue. We define revenue as net interest income plus non-interest income. As discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section, we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize, and concurrently stabilize, net interest income. We do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but are unable to eliminate it entirely. In addition to managing interest rate risk, we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk. Loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry, and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit. In addition to net interest income, non-interest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes, among other things, service charges on deposits and loans, investment fee income, gains and losses on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and gains on sales of mortgage loans.\nNet interest income and non-interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue, which is calculated as net interest income plus non-interest income, for the three years ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Net Interest\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Non-Interest\nIncome </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest income represented a larger portion of our total revenue for 2015 relative to 2014 as a result of a significant increase in gains realized and unrealized on mortgage loans held for sale. In addition to an increase in originations in 2015 compared to 2014, we also experienced an increase in gain on sale margins of approximately 20 basis points which was result of implementing our mandatory delivery loan sale program during the last six months of 2015. For 2014, non-interest income was a larger portion of our total revenue base compared to 2013 as the rate compression we experienced on gain on sale margins for loans sold during 2013 subsided during 2014 as the interest rate environment was not as volatile during 2014 as compared to 2013.\n2015 Economic Environment\nThe banking environment and the markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. and global economies, as well as the continued implementation of rulemaking from recent financial reforms. The U.S. economy grew during 2015 for the seventh consecutive year. While economic growth struggled to reach 2% during 2015, the labor market continued to improve. Employment gains were generally steady as the national unemployment rate fell to 5.0% by year end. With steady employment gains and continued low oil prices, consumer spending increased at a strong pace for most of 2015 and residential construction gained momentum. Nationally, home prices continued to rise by more than 5% during 2015 as equity markets remained fairly unchanged. U.S. Treasury yields were unstable during 2015 but began to rise modestly over the year as a Federal Reserve rate increase was expected. At its final meeting in 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee raised its targeted Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, its first rate increase in over nine years.\nAlthough global economic conditions remain unsettled, the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, the region we operate in, continued to perform relatively well, compared to other regions. As we believe that our region has weathered the recession better than most over the past several years, a protracted low interest rate environment, and the burden of regulatory requirements enacted in response to the recent financial crisis made for a challenging 2015. The housing industry and unemployment indicators improved during 2015 compared to 2014, where the effect of federal sequestration and spending cuts dampened economic growth and employment in defense-related professional and business service sectors. Progress in the near future for employment and the housing industry is uncertain given the prospect for higher long-term interest rates. We continue to consider future economic events and their impact on our performance.\nThe unemployment rate in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area decreased in tandem to the national unemployment rate to 3.8%, and commercial and residential real estate values held up well compared to other regions.\nOur credit quality continues to remain strong despite the challenging economic environment. At December 31, 2015, we had nonaccrual loans totaling $451,000 and no loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing. We recorded annualized net recoveries of 0.07% of our average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of a decrease in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2015, refinancing originations from our mortgage\nbanking segment increased significantly during 2015 to 31% of total originations for the full year 2015 compared to 21% of total originations for 2014.\nMarket illiquidity and concerns over credit risk continue to impact the ratings of our pooled trust preferred securities. We hold investments of $3.8 million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities, which are significantly below book value as of December 31, 2015 due to the lack of liquidity in the market, deferrals and defaults of issuers, and continued investor apprehension for investing in these types of investments.\nWe expect challenging economic and operating conditions and an evolving regulatory regime to continue for the foreseeable future. These conditions could continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results for 2016. The degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions and the nature of new banking regulations.\nWhile our loan growth has continued to be strong, continued uncertainty and sluggish economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which would adversely impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in real estate values and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially. The systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries also may not function as we have anticipated.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The primary sources of funding for our Bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects a third party or us. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events. While we believe we have a healthy liquidity position, any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future.\nThe U.S. government continues to enact legislation and develop various programs and initiatives designed to stabilize the financial services industry, stabilize the housing markets and stimulate the economy. The banking industry is awaiting many of the regulations resulting from the implementation of the Financial Reform Act. We remain unsure of the full impact this legislation will have on our business, operations or our financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. Management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. These policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such judgments, assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Actual results, in fact, could differ from initial estimates.\nThe accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses, accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans, the fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities, accounting for economic hedging activities, accounting for impairment testing of goodwill, accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management's best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers. Unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, may impact our assessment of possible credit losses. As a part of its analysis, we use our historical losses, loss emergence experience and qualitative factors, such as levels of and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charged-off loans, changes in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience and ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of credit, competition, and loan review results to support estimates.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of the loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments. For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on class segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For purposes of this analysis, we categorize loans into one of five categories: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate (including construction), home equity lines of credit, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. We also maintain an allowance for loan losses for acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded at the time of acquisition.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we transitioned to using its historical loss experience and trends in losses for each category which were then adjusted for portfolio trends and economical and environmental factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. The indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied to each of the five categories of loans. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the allowance model used the average loss rates of similar institutions based on its custom peer group as a baseline, which was adjusted for its particular loan portfolio characteristics and environmental factors. These changes did not have an impact to the overall allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment. We individually assigns loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes, as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent. In certain cases, we apply, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, a 5% loss factor to all loans classified as special mention, a 15% loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a 50% loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful. Loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged-off. However, in most instances, we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis for those loans that are adversely risk rated. For these loans, we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and considers estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis. If the net collateral value is less than the loan balance (including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan) we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan. Because of the limited number of impaired loans within the portfolio, we are able to evaluate each impaired loan individually and therefore specific reserves for impaired loans are generally less than those recommended by the listed regulatory guidelines above.\nThe general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. To arrive at the general component, the loan portfolio is grouped by loan type. A weighted average historical loss rate is computed for each group of loans over the trailing seven year period. We selected a seven year evaluation period as a result of the limited historical loss experience we have incurred, even during the recent economic downturn. We also believe that a seven year time horizon represents a full economic cycle. The historical loss factors are updated at least annually, unless a more frequent review of such factors is warranted. In addition to the use of historical loss factors, a qualitative adjustment factor is applied. This qualitative adjustment factor, which may be favorable or unfavorable, represents management's judgment that inherent losses in a given group of loans are different from historical loss rates due to environmental factors unique to that specific group of loans. These factors may relate to growth rate factors within the particular loan group; whether the recent loss history for a particular group of loans differs from its historical loss rate; the amount of loans in a particular group that have recently been designated as impaired and that may be indicative of future trends for this group; reported or observed difficulties that other banks are having with loans in the particular group; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending personnel; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans; and changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and adversely classified loans. The sum of the historical loss rate and the qualitative adjustment factor comprise the estimated annual loss rate. To adjust for inherent loss levels within the loan portfolio, a loss emergence factor is estimated based on an evaluation of the period of time it takes for a loan within each of our loan segments to deteriorate to the point an impairment loss is recorded within the allowance. The loss emergence factor is applied to the estimated annual loss rate to determine the expected annual loss amount.\nCredit losses are an inherent part of our business and, although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are appropriate, it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment. Additional provisions for such losses, if necessary, would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments, as appropriate, and would negatively impact earnings.\nAllowance for Loan Losses-Acquired Loans\nAcquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30\nFor our acquired loans, to the extent that we experience a deterioration in borrower credit quality resulting in a decrease in our expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition of the loans, an allowance for loan losses would be established based on our estimate of future credit losses over the remaining life of the loans.\nAcquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-20\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, we establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation process that is similar to our evaluation process used for originated loans. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, carrying value of the loans, which includes the remaining net purchase discount or premium, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses.\nPurchased Credit-Impaired Loans\nPurchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which are the loans acquired in our acquisition of UFBC, are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). These loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no allowance for loan losses. We account for interest income on all loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality) based on the acquired loans' expected cash flows. The acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flow. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loans, or the \"accretable yield,\" is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses on these impaired pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (representing the present value of all cash flows that were expected at acquisition but currently are not expected to be received). At December 31, 2015, there was no reserve for impairment of PCI loans within our allowance for loan losses.\nWe periodically evaluate the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Changes in the contractual required payments due and estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and non-accretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. On an aggregate basis, if the acquired pools of PCI loans perform better than originally expected, we would expect to receive more future cash flows than originally modeled at the acquisition date. For the pools with better than expected cash flows, the forecasted increase would be recorded as an additional accretable yield that is recognized as a prospective increase to our interest income on loans.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Our investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry-wide valuation service. This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. For certain of our held-to-maturity investment securities where there is minimal observable trading activity, we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value based on internal calculations and compare our results to information provided by external pricing sources.\nWe also fair value our interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales commitments. The fair value of our interest rate lock commitments considers the expected premium (discount) to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan. In addition, we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination, and then period end, using applicable published mortgage-backed investment security prices. The fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date. At loan closing, the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is included in the cost basis of loans held for sale, which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.\nAccounting for Economic Hedging Activities\nWe record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For derivatives designated as hedges, we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness. We evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective. In situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contractual commitments, including rate lock commitments, to finance residential mortgage loans. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings.\nTo mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments, we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts. During the rate lock commitment period, these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value elements of the rate lock commitment related to servicing and the wholesale and retail rate spread, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. At the closing of the loan, the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract. The forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale. Loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.\nAccounting for Impairment Testing of Goodwill\nWe have adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-08 (\"ASU 2011-08\"), Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This ASU permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform the two-step impairment test. We perform our annual review of the goodwill during the third quarter.\nIn the event we are required to perform a Step 1 fair value evaluation of the reporting unit, we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit. This discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including: estimated future\ncash flows from operations; an estimate of a terminal value; a discount rate; and other inputs. Our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows. If the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nAccounting for the Impairment of Amortizing Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe continually review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable. We evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows, before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis, with the net book value of long-term assets, including amortizable intangible assets. If undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets, further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment.\nAn impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values. Fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods. When substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset, the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered. Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes.\nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-04, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure (\"ASU No. 2014-04\"), which clarifies when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. An in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs upon either the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Additionally, this ASU requires interim and annual disclosure of both the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. ASU No. 2014-04 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-04 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-01, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects (\"ASU No. 2014-01\"), which amends existing guidance to permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their\ninvestments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense or benefit. For those investments in qualified affordable housing projects not accounted for using the proportional amortization method, the investment should be accounted for as an equity method investment or a cost method investment in accordance with Subtopic 970-323. ASU No. 2014-01 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-01 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a framework that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, for public entities. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. This ASU changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. Additionally, for repurchase financing arrangements, the amendments of this ASU require separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. The requirements are effective for public entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2014. The disclosure of certain transactions accounted for as a sale is required to be presented for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and the disclosure for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as securities borrowings is required to be presented for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-01 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides an acquired entity an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. This ASU is effective for public business entities on November 18, 2014. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this guidance.\nFinancial Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $47.3 million on a consolidated basis. The commercial banking segment recorded net income of $39.2 million and our mortgage banking segment recorded net income of $9.2 million. The wealth management services business segment reported net income of $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income of $32.7 million on a consolidated basis. The commercial banking segment recorded net income of $34.4 million and our mortgage banking segment recorded a net loss of $2.7 million. The wealth management services business segment reported net income of $135,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nAt December 31, 2015, total assets were $4.03 billion, an increase of 18.6%, or $630.8 million, from $3.40 billion at December 31, 2014. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 18.4%, or $475.2 million, to $3.06 billion at December 31, 2015, from $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014. Total investment securities increased by $75.6 million, or 21.7%, to $423.8 million\nat December 31, 2015, from $348.2 million at December 31, 2014. Total deposits increased 19.6%, or $497.4 million, to $3.03 billion at December 31, 2015, from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014. Other borrowed funds, which primarily include customer repurchase agreements, federal funds sold and Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances, increased $100.0 million to $538.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $438.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $413.1 million, an increase of $35.8 million from $377.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $47.3 million less dividends paid to shareholders totaling $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased shareholders' equity $3.1 million during 2015. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively. Book value per share at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12.76 and $11.76, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.37% at December 31, 2015 compared to 11.78% at December 31, 2014. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded net income of $47.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $32.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, in 2014. Net interest income increased $8.7 million to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a result of increase in interest earning assets. Provision for loan losses was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.9 million for 2014. Non-interest income increased $13.5 million to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $39.2 million for 2014 due primarily to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking business segment. Non-interest expense was $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase in salaries and benefits expense during 2015 was offset by a decrease in merger and acquisition expense as we added to the sales and operational staffing areas of the Company over the past year as a result of our continued growth and increased regulatory environment in addition to an increase in the variable component of compensation expense.\nThe return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 1.29% and 1.02%, respectively. The return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 11.76% and 8.82%, respectively.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nAt December 31, 2014, total assets were $3.40 billion, an increase of 17.5%, or $504.9 million, from $2.89 billion at December 31, 2013. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 26.5%, or $540.9 million, to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.04 billion at December 31, 2013. Total investment securities decreased by $11.5 million, or 3.2%, to $348.2 million at December 31, 2014, from $359.7 million at December 31, 2013. Total deposits increased 23.1%, or $476.5 million, to $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2013. Other borrowed funds decreased $37.2 million to $438.0 million at December 31, 2014, from $475.2 million at December 31, 2013.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 was $377.3 million, an increase of $56.8 million from $320.5 million at December 31, 2013. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the shares issued as a result of our acquisition of UFBC. For each share of UFBC common stock outstanding, the shareholders of UFBC received a fixed exchange ratio of $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our\ncommon stock. We issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and added $25.2 million in additional paid in capital for a total of $26.8 million in additional capital. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income added $5.3 million in capital offset by dividends paid to common shareholders of $10.9 million during 2014. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11.1%. Book value per share at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.76 and $10.57, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.78% at December 31, 2014 compared to 12.89% at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2014.\nWe recorded net income of $32.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net income of $25.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, in 2013. Net interest income increased $15.4 million to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a result of increase in interest earning assets and strategically decreasing the rates we pay on our deposits. Provision for loan losses was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a benefit of $32,000 for 2013. Non-interest income increased $9.3 million to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $29.9 million for 2013 due primarily to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking business segment. Non-interest expense was $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.6 million, or 13.7%, compared to $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expense, occupancy expense, and expenses attributable to our acquisition of UFBC.\nThe return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 1.02% and 0.92%, respectively. The return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 8.82% and 7.96%, respectively.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. It represents non-interest expense as a percentage of net interest income and non-interest income. The lower the percentage, the more efficient we are operating. We believe use of the efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides additional clarity in assessing our operating results.\nSee the table below for the components of our calculation of our efficiency ratio as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Our efficiency ratio decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014 because of a combined increase in net interest income and non-interest income, specifically income related to our mortgage banking business segment, while maintaining non-interest expense during 2015 at the same level as for 2014.\nEfficiency Ratio Calculation\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Calculation of efficiency ratio(1):\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>116,394 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>107,700 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>92,345 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,911 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net interest income and non-interest income for efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>65.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>69.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Efficiency ratio is calculated as total non-interest expense divided by the total of net interest income and non-interest income\nStatements of Income\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue, representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates. Interest rates have remained at historic lows for the last several years as the Federal Reserve has had an extremely accommodative policy. We expect this low interest rate environment to discontinue during 2016 as the Federal Reserve has begun to gradually increase the targeted federal funds rate with its first rate increase of 0.25% in nearly a decade in December 2015.

</tr>\n</table>\n(1)Non-accrual loans are included in average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield. Interest income on non-accruing loans was not material for the years presented.\n(2)Interest income for loans receivable and investment securities available-for-sale is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis at a rate of 34% for 2015 and 33% for 2014.\n(3)Changes attributable to rate/volume have been allocated to volume.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $116.4 million, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $8.7 million, or 8.1%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase in the volume of interest-earning assets during 2015 compared to 2014. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 23 basis points to 4.06% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 4.29% for the same period of 2014. To offset this decrease in yield, during the first quarter of 2015, we reduced our wholesale funding costs related to other borrowed funds by 30 basis points as we restructured a portion of our fixed rate FHLB advance portfolio. This restructuring reduced our FHLB advance funding costs from 3.33% to 2.80%.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 3.37% and 3.59%, respectively. The decrease in our net interest margin was primarily a result\nof a decrease in the yields on our interest-earning assets partially offset by a slight decrease in the costs related to our interest-bearing liabilities during 2015. Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, is a financial measure that we believe provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use our federal statutory tax rates for the periods presented. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.06% in 2015 from 4.29% in 2014. Total average earning assets increased by 15.5% to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.04 billion at December 31, 2014 which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $12.1 million to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $130.3 million 2014. The increase in our earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in average loans receivable of $397.3 million, which contributed to an additional $17.5 million in interest income on a tax equivalent basis for 2015. This increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio which decreased interest income $6.4 million on a tax equivalent basis. The increase in loans receivable during 2015 was attributable to organic growth. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2015 and 2014. Additional interest income of approximately $201,000 for 2015 and $866,000 for 2014 would have been realized had all nonperforming loans performed as originally expected. Nonperforming loans exclude those loans that are both past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest due to an assessment of collectibility.\nAs a result of the significant increase in loan origination activity that occurred at George Mason during 2015, average balances for loans held for sale increased $56.2 million to $344.5 million and resulted in an increase in interest income from loans held for sale of $1.1 million to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 201. The increase in outstanding balances in the loans held for sale portfolio during 2015 contributed to the increase in other borrowed funds as we use wholesale funding in the form of brokered certificates of deposits and FHLB advances to help fund this loan portfolio.\nTotal average interest-bearing deposits increased $361.7 million to $2.21 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.85 billion at December 31, 2014. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $65.1 million to $619.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $553.9 million at December 31, 2014. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our certificates of deposit, which increased $261.2 million compared to 2014. Average brokered certificates of deposit increased $120.9 million during 2015. This change in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities increased our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.73% in 2015 from 0.66% in 2014. The cost of other borrowed funds, which generally are shorter term fundings used to help fund our balance sheet growth and support our loans held for sale portfolio, decreased 30 basis points to 2.00% in 2015 from 2.30% in 2014, a result of the aforementioned FHLB advance restructuring we completed during the first quarter of 2015. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 3 basis points to 0.92% in 2015 from 0.95% in 2014 as a result of the aforementioned changes in funding sources.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $107.7 million, compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $15.4 million, or 16.6%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of the interest-earning assets we acquired from UFBC in addition to the organic growth that occurred during 2014. We also continued to strategically decrease rates on our deposit products as a result of the low interest rate environment during 2014.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 3.59% and 3.52%, respectively. The increase in our net interest margin was primarily a result of a decrease in the yields on our interest-bearing liabilities offset partially by a slight decrease in the yields over our interest-earning assets.\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.29% in 2014 from 4.33% in 2013. Total average earning assets increased by 14.4% to $3.04 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $2.66 billion at December 31, 2013 which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $15.1 million to $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $115.2 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in our earnings assets was primarily driven by an increase in average loans receivable of $516.7 million, which contributed to an additional $23.3 million in interest income on a tax equivalent basis for 2014. This increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio which decreased interest income $5.2 million on a tax equivalent basis. The increase in loans receivable during 2014 was a combination of loans acquired of $238.3 million during the year with the remaining increase in loans attributable to organic growth. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2014 and 2013. Additional interest income of approximately $866,000 for 2014 and $626,000 for 2013 would have been realized had all nonperforming loans performed as originally expected.\nAs a result of the significant decrease in loan origination activity that occurred at George Mason during 2014, average balances for loans held for sale decreased $118.4 million to $288.3 million and resulted in a decrease in interest income from loans held for sale of $4.5 million to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result of the decrease in our loans held for sale portfolio, we invested the excess cash (which was earning 0.25% in federal funds sold) through purchases of $47.7 million in investment securities during 2014. The decrease in outstanding balances in the loans held for sale portfolio during 2014 contributed to the decrease in other borrowed funds.\nTotal average interest-bearing deposits increased $142.4 million to $1.85 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $1.71 billion at December 31, 2013. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $139.8 million to $553.9 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $414.2 million at December 31, 2013. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our interest checking, which increased $52.8 million compared to 2013. Average brokered certificates of deposit decreased $27.3 million during 2014. These changes in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities assisted in us decreasing our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.66% in 2014 from 0.76% in 2013. The cost of other borrowed funds, decreased 68 basis points to 2.30% in 2014 from 2.98% in 2013, a result of our paying off certain FHLB advances at maturity as the loans held for sale portfolio decreased. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 14 basis points to 0.95% in 2014 from 1.09% in 2013 as a result of the aforementioned changes in funding sources.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk. Our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk. Management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain. We manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee (\"ALCO\"). ALCO is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management.\nWe employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity. We use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity. Many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are\ndeveloped for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the current balance sheet, the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions, the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged. This is considered the base case. Next, the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down 100 basis points and up 200 basis points. The down 200 basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates. In the ramped down rate change, the model moves rates gradually down 100 basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year.\nFor the up 200 basis point scenario, rates are gradually moved up 200 basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year. In both the up and down scenarios, the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case.\nAt December 31, 2015, our asset/liability position was slightly asset sensitive based on our interest rate sensitivity model. Our net interest income would decrease by less than 1.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 2.0% in an up 200 basis point scenario over a one-year time frame. In the two-year time horizon, our net interest income would decrease by less than 2.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 2.9% in an up 200 basis point scenario.\nProvision Expense and Allowance for Loan Losses\nOur policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers.\nWe recorded a provision of $1.4 million for our loan loss provisioning for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was $31.7 million compared to $28.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our allowance for loan loss ratio as a percent of total loans at December 31, 2015 was 1.04% compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2014. The decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is a result of improved credit quality during 2015.\nDuring 2015 the credit quality in our loan portfolio remained strong, as we have experienced decreases in our nonperforming assets as compared to historical periods and net recoveries as we work out our problem credits. During 2014, our level of nonperforming assets increased as we acquired several impaired loans that were held within the UFBC loan portfolio. These impaired loans had been on nonaccrual status prior to the acquisition date or had demonstrated that there was with limited possibility for improvement and therefore we placed such loans on nonaccrual. The decrease in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 was a result of three nonperforming loans paying off in total and selling three nonperforming loan relationships. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded charge-offs of $291,000 related to commercial, residential and consumer loans. Recoveries from previously charged-off loans totaled $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, most of which were related to commercial loans. Of the recoveries recorded, one was previously a troubled debt restructuring.\nAnnualized net loan recoveries was 0.07% of average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to annualized net loan charge-offs of 0.06% of average loans receivable\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014. Nonaccrual loans (less interest and credit marks assigned to PCI loans) totaled $451,000 at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nA sluggish job market and declining home values could adversely affect our home equity lines of credit, credit card and other loan portfolios, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. At December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate portfolio (including construction lending) portfolio was 67.8% of our total loan portfolio. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our business, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level or our credit exposure to individual entities and industries, may not function as we have anticipated.\nThe provision for loan losses was a benefit of $32,000 for 2013. We recorded net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaling $496,000.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Policies\" above for more information on our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nThe following tables present additional information pertaining to the activity in and allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type and the percentage of the loan type to the total loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities, investment fee income, and gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and continues to be an important factor in our operating results. Non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $52.7 million and $39.2 million, respectively.\nThe increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014, is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking segment. Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased $11.4 million to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $32.1 million for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $43.5 million, which was comprised of $39.7 million in realized gains and a $3.8 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $32.1 million, which was comprised of $28.7 million in realized gains and a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. In addition to the increase in origination activity, the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities was impacted by an increase in gain on sale margins during 2015 as compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed $3.6 billion in mortgage originations compared to $3.0 billion in 2014. Refinance activity represented approximately 31% of the originations during 2015, an increase from 21% experienced during 2014.\nIn accordance with GAAP, if a lender enters into a mortgage loan commitment with a customer and intends to sell the mortgage loan after it is funded, the written loan commitment is to be accounted for as a derivative instrument and is to be recorded at fair value through earnings. George Mason enters into commitments where individual loans are \"locked in\" at a specified interest rate for a\nfixed period. At the time of commitment, George Mason also enters into a \"best efforts\" forward contract with an investor to sell the loan at an agreed upon price if, and after, the loan is closed. This price represents the fair value of the \"interest rate lock commitment\" (IRLC) and is an unrealized gain that is included in earnings during the period of the IRLC. This gain is also recognized earlier in earnings than the expenses associated with originating, underwriting and closing the loan, which, under GAAP, are recognized and deferred by the Company at the time of loan sale to the investor. When the loan actually closes, the unrealized gain is added to the basis of the ensuing loan held for sale (LHFS). At any point in time (e.g. quarter end) the fair value of the existing IRLCs (not yet closed) and the premium to the basis of existing LHFS (loans closed but not yet purchased by investors) represent unrealized gains that have been recognized in income, either in the current period or prior periods. At the time the loan is sold to investors, the \"investor buy price\" is equal to the basis of the loan held for sale, and there is no gain or loss recognized. This accounting creates a mismatch between the income recognition on loan production and the expense recognition for those same loans. Direct costs associated with the loan origination, such as commissions and salaries, are recorded as a reduction to realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities.\nMaintaining our revenue stream in the mortgage banking segment is dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors at or near current volumes. Over the last several years, we have increased our mortgage banking presence to include the Richmond and Virginia Beach areas of the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by less refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our net income.\nInvestment fee income decreased $227,000 to $489,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $716,000 for 2014. Investment fee income includes net commissions earned at CWS during 2015 and 2014.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $124,000 to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Service charges on deposit accounts include insufficient funds fee income, service charges on deposit accounts, other fee income on deposit accounts and ATM transaction fees as shown in the table above. Loan fees totaled $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $399,000, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in loan fee income is a result of a decrease in prepayment penalties during 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, income from bank-owned life insurance was $433,000, a decrease of $50,000 when compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease is a result of the decrease in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank-owned life insurance.\nWe recorded trading gains of $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to trading gains of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have purchased investments to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability. These investments are designated as trading securities, and as such, the changes in fair value are reflected in earnings. These trading gains were primarily the result of increased stock prices and were mostly offset by a compensation expense associated with this benefit plan.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded gains on the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million.\nDuring 2015, we recorded a litigation settlement of $3.0 million which also contributed to the increase in noninterest income for 2015.\nNon-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $39.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively. The increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the same period of 2013, is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking segment. Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased $10.4 million to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $21.6 million for 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $32.1 million, which was comprised of $28.7 million in realized gains and a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $21.6 million, which was comprised of $36.7 million in realized gains and a $15.1 million decrease in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we closed $3.0 billion in mortgage originations compared to $5.8 billion in 2013. Refinance activity represented approximately 21% of the originations during 2014, a decrease from 33% experienced during 2013.\nThe increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is a result of the increase in gain on sale margins we experienced during 2014 as compared to 2013. In addition, the change in the unrealized portion of our gains on loan sales was an increase of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a decrease of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nManagement fee income, which represented the income earned for services George Mason provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders and generally fluctuated based on the volume of loan sales, decreased to $21,000 during 2014 compared to $2.0 million in 2013. The decrease in management fee income is a result of the discontinuation of all of our remaining managed company relationships within the last year.\nInvestment fee income decreased $621,000 to $716,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1.3 million for 2013. Investment fee income includes net commissions earned at CWS during 2014 and for 2013, income earned at Wilson/Bennett and from our trust division prior to the completion of the aforementioned wealth management reorganization as of June 30, 2013.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $178,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Loan fees totaled $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $548,000, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Title insurance and other income totaled $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $987,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in title insurance and other income is primarily a result of our closing George Mason's title company as new regulations impaired our ability to maintain a level of profitability within this subsidiary.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, income from bank-owned life insurance was $483,000, an decrease of $72,000 when compared to the same period of 2013. The increase is a result of the increase in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank-owned life insurance.\nWe recorded trading gains of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to trading gains of $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded gains on the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table reflects the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salary and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>51,844 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>45,963 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing and communications\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance assessments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loan repurchases and settlements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank franchise taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of pooled trust preferred securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger and acquisition expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premises and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stationary and supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Travel and entertainment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Miscellaneous\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,283 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>96,298 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>96,228 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>84,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest expense includes, among other things, salaries and benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, depreciation, data processing, telecommunications and miscellaneous expenses. Non-interest expense was $96.3 million and $96.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $5.8 million to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $46.0 million for 2014. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily related to increases in our business development personnel in our commercial banking and mortgage banking segments. We added commercial lenders at the Bank and increased back office staffing levels due to our increased regulatory environment. In addition, the variable component of our compensation expense increased during 2015 as a result of our 2015 performance.\nOccupancy expense decreased $480,000 to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $10.3 million for 2014. The decrease in occupancy expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the closing of several branch office locations during 2014 and one in 2015. As a result of our UFBC acquisition, we had five branch offices that overlapped existing markets. Decreases in depreciation expense of $324,000, data processing and communications of $840,000, and merger and acquisitions expense of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 can be attributed to the acquisition of UFBC during 2014 and the cost savings we received post acquisition.\nProfessional fees increased $1.5 million to $4.6 million for 2015 compared to $3.1 million for 2014. The increase in professional fees during 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees as a result of litigation which was settled during the second quarter of 2015 and an increase in external audit and accounting fees from prior year's engagement.\nAdvertising and marketing expense decreased $906,000 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5.1 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease in marketing and advertising expense was a result of the branch expansion that occurred during 2014 as a result of branch acquisitions and de novo growth. No similar expansion occurred during 2015.\nMortgage loan repurchases and settlements for 2015 was $397,000 compared to $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to one settlement related to the previous financial crisis. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to limit our exposure to loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors. Given the steps that have been taken to limit our exposure coupled with the passage of time and the expiration of the statute of limitations for loans originated in certain prior years, our current expectation is that future putback claims will be limited in number. We evaluate the individual merits of each claim, and recognize an expense when settlement is deemed probable and the amount of such a settlement is estimable.\nNon-interest expense was $96.2 million and $84.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $11.6 million, or 13.7%. The increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily the result of increases in salary and benefits costs, occupancy expense, and expenses related to the acquisition of UFBC during 2014.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $4.4 million to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $41.5 million for 2013. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily related to increases in our business development personnel in our commercial banking and mortgage banking segments. We added commercial lenders at the Bank and opened one de novo banking offices during 2014. In addition, the variable component of our compensation expense increased during 2014 as a result of our 2014 performance.\nOccupancy expense increased $1.9 million to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $8.4 million for 2013. The increase in occupancy expense during 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage origination offices and acquired and de novo banking offices as we strategically increase our market share. Data processing and communications expense increased $1.7 million to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.7 million, a result of the aforementioned increase in locations.\nProfessional fees decreased $643,000 to $3.1 million for 2014 compared to $3.8 million for 2013. The decrease in professional fees during 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to a decrease in temporary staffing that was allocated to George Mason to handle the increase in loan origination volume during the 2013 refinance boom. The level of temporary staffing was maintained at George Mason until the beginning of the third quarter of 2013 when loan origination volume dropped significantly due to the current mortgage market conditions.\nAdvertising and marketing expense increased slightly by $376,000 to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $4.7 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in marketing and advertising expense was a result of the branch expansion that occurred during 2014 as a result of branch acquisitions and de novo growth.\nMortgage loan repurchases and settlements for 2014 was $83,000 compared to a benefit of $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nMerger and acquisition expense was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $464,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of our acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. Merger and acquisition related expenses primarily include expenses related to staff reductions, branch office consolidations, contract termination payments and back office systems consolidations.\nWe recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment of $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of the issuance of the Final Rules required by the Financial Reform Act which were released by federal banking agencies in late 2013. The impairment recorded brought the book value of these investments in line with their fair value as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we have recorded in full the impairment loss recorded in 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2015 was 33.7%, compared to 32.9% for 2014. Our effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate because of income we receive on tax-exempt investments and tax credits we have related to low income housing investments.\nWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2013 was 32.3%. See also \"Critical Accounting Policies-Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\".\nStatements of Condition\nLoans Receivable, Net\nTotal loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $3.06 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $475.2 million, or 18.4%, compared to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014. Loans held for sale increased $68.4 million to $383.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $315.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in our inventory of loans held for sale during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the significant increase in loan origination and sales volume, a result of increases in loan originators during 2015 in addition to preferential market conditions during 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (less interest and credit marks for PCI loans) totaling $451,000. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014 totaled $3.4 million. We had no accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. During 2015, our level of nonperforming loans decreased as a result of three nonperforming loans paying off in total and selling three nonperforming loan relationships. Loans that are classified as \"troubled debt restructurings\" at December 31, 2015 totaled $365,000 compared to $289,000 at December 31, 2014.\nInterest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded when cash is received. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income if it was accrued in the current year and is charged to the allowance for loan losses if it was accrued in prior years. While on nonaccrual, the collection of interest is recorded as interest income only after all past-due principal has been collected. When all past contractual obligations are collected and, in our opinion, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to remain current, the loan is returned to an accruing status. At December 31, 2015, the loans on nonaccrual status did not have a valuation allowance. Gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonaccrual loans had been current with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $201,000 and $8666,000, respectively. The interest income realized prior to loans being placed on nonaccrual status for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6,000 and $80,000, respectively.\nTotal loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $540.9 million, or 26.5%, compared to $2.04 billion at December 31, 2013. Loans held for sale decreased $58.7 million to $315.3 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $374.0 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease in our inventory of loans held for sale during 2014 compared to 2013\nis primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination and sales volume, as mortgage rates have increased as a result of market concerns over the ending of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, which had kept interest rate at historic lows.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis totaling $3.4 million (less interest and credit marks for PCI loans). Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2013 totaled $2.3 million. We had no accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. During 2014, our level of nonperforming loans increased as we acquired several impaired loans that were held within the UFBC loan portfolio. These impaired loans had been on nonaccrual status prior to the acquisition date or had demonstrated that there was limited possibility for improvement and therefore we placed such loans on nonaccrual during 2014. Loans that are classified as \"troubled debt restructurings\" at December 31, 2014 totaled $289,000 compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2012.\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.02%, 0.17%, and 0.11% at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe following tables present the composition of our loans receivable portfolio at the end of each of the five years ended December 31, 2015 and additional information on nonperforming loans receivable.\nLoans Receivable\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

Securities\nOur investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity. The investment portfolio consists of investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities held-to-maturity and trading securities. Investment securities available-for-sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability strategy, liquidity management or regulatory capital management. Investment securities held-to-maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Investment securities-trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability. These securities include cash equivalents, equities and mutual funds. Investment securities were $423.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $75.6 million or 21.7%, from $348.2 million at December 31, 2014. We purchased $144.0 million in investment securities during 2015 as a result of an excess cash position we had at the Bank and to help enhance our net interest margin by investing in higher yielding earning assets.\nOf the $423.8 million in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, $3.8 million were classified as held-to-maturity, $414.1 million were classified as available-for-sale, and $5.9 million were\nclassified as trading securities. At December 31, 2015, the yield on the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 3.20% and the yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.19%.\nWe complete reviews for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2015, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency. Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk. At December 31, 2015, 99% of our mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).\nWe have $947,000 in non-government non-agency mortgage-backed securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. The various protective elements on the non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes, which could impact the ratings of these securities.\nAt December 31, 2015, certain of our investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position. Investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. Contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government. Other mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due. We do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.\nAt December 31, 2015, we owned two pooled trust preferred securities classified as held-to-maturity. The par and carrying values of these securities were each $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. The collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions. We own the A-3 tranches in each issuance. Each of the bonds is rated by more than one rating agency. One security has a composite rating of AA and the other security has a composite rating of A. Observable trading activity remains limited for these types of securities. We have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services. Given the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches, and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral, we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the securities, and concluded that these securities are not other-than-temporarily impaired. We continuously monitor the financial condition of the underlying issues and the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches. We also utilize a multi-scenario model which assumes varying levels of additional defaults and deferrals and the effects of such adverse developments on the contractual cash flows for the A-3 tranches. In each of the adverse scenarios, there was no indication of a break to the A-3 contractual cash flows.\nNo other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized for the securities in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe hold $18.1 million in FHLB stock at December 31, 2015 which is included in other investments on the statement of condition.\nInvestment securities were $348.2 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.5 million or 3.2%, from $359.7 million at December 31, 2013. We purchased $48.0 million in investment securities during 2014 as a result of an excess cash position we had at the Bank due to the decrease in our loans held for sale portfolio.\nOf the $348.2 million in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2014, $4.0 million were classified as held-to-maturity, $339.1 million were classified as available-for-sale, and $5.1 million were classified as trading securities. At December 31, 2014, the yield on the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 3.44% and the yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.13%.\nThe following table reflects the composition of the

Funds\nTotal deposits were $3.03 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $497.4 million, or 19.6%, from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in total deposits during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to our deposit gathering efforts and in increase in wholesale deposit fundings during 2015. We have had success in attracting deposit balances from customers seeking to deposit their money with smaller, local banks and depositors are increasing balances held with financial institutions as a result of the increased protection of their money by the FDIC.\nWe use short term brokered CDs to assist us in funding our loans held for sale portfolio. Brokered certificates of deposit increased to $407.0 million at December 31, 2015, of which $67.0 million were placed in the CDARS program. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service (\"CDARS\"). CDARS allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit. When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, funds are placed into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. Brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2014 were $310.4 million, of which $32.3 million were in the CDARS program.\nOther borrowed funds, which primarily include federal funds purchased, customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and our payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, were $538.0 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $100.0 million, from $438.0 million at December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the increase in other borrowed funds at December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $115.0 million to $355.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $240.0 million at December 31, 2013. These advances were primarily used to assist in funding loans receivable originations at the Bank during 2015.\nOther borrowed funds at each of December 31, 2015 and 2014, included $20.6 million payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, the issuer of our trust preferred securities. This debt had an interest rate of 2.91% and 2.64% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated entity as we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust.\nIn connection with the UFBC acquisition, we acquired all of the voting and common shares of UFBC Capital Trust I (the \"UFBC Trust\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary established for the sole purpose of issuing $5.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. These trust preferred securities are due in 2035 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.10%, which adjusts quarterly. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the interest rate on trust preferred securities was 2.61% and 2.34%, respectively. The UFBC Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary since we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity.\nAt December 31, 2015, other borrowed funds also included $113.6 million in customer repurchase agreements compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2014. Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2015 was $45.0 million compared to $70.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table reflects the short-term borrowings and other borrowed funds outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Other Borrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2015\n(In thousands)\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Advance\nDate </th> <th> </th> <th>Term of\nAdvance </th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity or\nCall Date </th> <th> </th> <th>Interest\nRate </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount\nOutstanding </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Dec-15 </td> <td> </td> <td>1 month </td> <td> </td> <td>Jan-16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total short-term FHLB advances and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other short-term borrowed funds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer repurchase agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Funds Purchased\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other short-term borrowed funds and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>158,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowed funds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust preferred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances-long term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>330,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowed funds and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>354,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other borrowed funds and weighted average rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>537,965 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits were $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $476.5 million, or 23.1%, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase in total deposits during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due the deposits we acquired in our acquisition of UFBC of $295.2 million, and $64.6 million in deposits from a branch office acquisition in Gainesville, Virginia, in addition to organic growth that occurred during the year.

performance. Our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence.\nRegulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution. The guidelines define capital as both Tier 1 (which includes common shareholders' equity, defined to include certain debt obligations) and Tier 2 (to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and 45% of unrealized gains in equity securities).\nOn January 1, 2015, the new Basel III regulatory risk-based capital rules became effective. Basel III includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refines the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, which is increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the current rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.\nThis new regulatory standard also provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets related to temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.\nBasel III prescribes a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $413.1 million, an increase of $35.8 million, compared to $377.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $47.3 million less dividends paid to shareholders of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3.1 million during 2015. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively. Book value per share at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12.76 and $11.76, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.37% at December 31, 2015 compared to 11.78% at December 31, 2014 (which was calculated under the previous regulatory capital rules). Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 was $377.3 million, an increase of $56.8 million, compared to $320.5 million at December 31, 2013. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the shares issued as a result of our acquisition of UFBC. For each share of UFBC common stock outstanding, the shareholders of UFBC received a fixed exchange ratio of $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our common stock. We issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and added $25.2 million in additional paid in capital for a total of $26.8 million in additional capital. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income added $5.3 million in capital offset by dividends paid to common shareholders of $10.9 million during 2014. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11.1%. Book value per share at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.76 and $10.57, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.78% at\nDecember 31, 2014 compared to 12.89% at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2014.\nAs noted above, regulatory capital levels for the bank and bank holding company meet those established for \"well-capitalized\" institutions. While we are currently considered \"well-capitalized,\" we may from time-to-time find it necessary to access the capital markets to meet our growth objectives or capitalize on specific business opportunities.\nThe following table shows the minimum capital requirement and our capital position at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 for the Company and for the Bank.\nCapital Components\nAt

We must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non-cash items into cash. The objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations, personal service and pricing.\nIn addition to deposits, we have access to the different wholesale funding markets. These markets include the brokered CD market, the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Services (\"CDARS\"). CDARS allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit through our Bank. When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, we place their funds into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. We also maintain secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged. Having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding.\nCash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers.\nWe have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management. For our liquidity management program, we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion. We also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. We believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled $453.4 million at December 31, 2015, or 11.3% of total assets. We held investments that are classified as held-to-maturity in the amount of $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. To maintain ready access to the Bank's secured lines of credit, the Bank has pledged roughly half of its investment securities and a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial & industrial loan portfolios pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at December 31, 2015 was approximately $678.5 million. Borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was approximately $164.8 million at December 31, 2015. These facilities are subject to the FHLB and the Federal Reserve approving disbursement to us. In addition, we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of $315 million available to us. We anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors, provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into a number of long-term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities. These contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us and exclude contractual interest costs, where applicable.\nThe required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2015\n(In thousands)\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due by Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>776,413 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>356,056 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>334,361 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>57,297 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,699 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust preferred securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,889 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,599,026 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>629,400 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>690,765 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>154,889 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>123,972 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Credit Risk\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.\nThe Bank's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include deposits\nheld by us, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business.\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. We hold certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.\nA summary of the contract amount of the Bank's exposure to off-balance-sheet risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, is as follows:\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,480,407 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,517,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments to extend credit of $247.4 million as of December 31, 2015 were related to George Mason's mortgage loan funding commitments and were of a short-term nature. Commitments to extend credit of $1.2 billion primarily have floating rates as of December 31, 2015. It is uncertain as to the amount that we will be required to fund on these commitments as many such arrangements expire with no amount drawn.\nWe have counter-party risk which may arise from the possible inability of George Mason's third-party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts. George Mason works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk. We do not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation. We continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties. We do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations.\nGeorge Mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities. We evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims. We have taken steps to limit our exposure to such loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors. As a result, we received a limited number of additional claims.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, George Mason settled with investors on such loans for a total of $0 and $194,000, respectively. This reserve had a balance of $500,000 and $150,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expense (benefit) related to this reserve for the years ended December 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $397,000, $83,000, and ($49,000), respectively.\nQuarterly Data\nThe following table provides quarterly data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following presents management's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nCaution About Forward-Looking Statements\nWe make certain forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals. The words \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including:\n\u2022 the risks of changes in interest rates on levels, composition and costs of deposits, loan demand, and the values and liquidity of loan collateral, securities, and interest sensitive assets and liabilities;\n\u2022 changes in assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible loan losses, reserves for repurchases of mortgage loans sold and other estimates;\n\u2022 changes in market conditions, specifically declines in the residential and commercial real estate market, volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, soundness of other financial institutions we do business with;\n\u2022 decrease in the volume of loan originations at our mortgage banking subsidiary as a result of the cyclical nature of mortgage banking, changes in interest rates, economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market which would negatively impact the income recorded on the sales of loans held for sale.\n\u2022 risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values;\n\u2022 declines in the prices of assets and market illiquidity may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment or other losses, specifically in our pooled trust preferred\nsecurities portfolio resulting from increases in underlying issuers' defaulting or deferring payments;\n\u2022 changes in operations within the wealth management services segment, its customer base and assets under management;\n\u2022 changes in operations of George Mason Mortgage, LLC as a result of the activity in the residential real estate market and any associated impact on the fair value of goodwill in the future;\n\u2022 legislative and regulatory changes, including the Financial Reform Act and implementation of the Volcker Rule, and other changes in banking, securities, and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators, and changes in scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverages;\n\u2022 exposure to repurchase loans sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor;\n\u2022 the risks of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including, without limitation, the related time and costs of implementing such transactions, integrating operations as part of these transactions and possible failures to achieve expected gains, revenue growth and/or expense savings from such transactions;\n\u2022 the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies as we implement new or change internal operating systems or if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future;\n\u2022 the effects of future economic, business and market conditions;\n\u2022 governmental monetary and fiscal policies;\n\u2022 changes in accounting policies, rules and practices;\n\u2022 maintaining cost controls and asset quality as we open or acquire new branches;\n\u2022 maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth;\n\u2022 reliance on our management team, including our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022 competition with other banks and financial institutions, and companies outside of the banking industry, including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources;\n\u2022 demand, development and acceptance of new products and services;\n\u2022 problems with technology utilized by us;\n\u2022 changing trends in customer profiles and behavior; and\n\u2022 other factors described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC.\nBecause of these uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results.\nIn addition, this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A above.\nOverview\nWe are a financial holding company formed in 1997 and headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia. We were formed principally in response to opportunities resulting from the consolidation of several Virginia-based banks. These bank consolidations were typically accompanied by the dissolution of local boards of directors and relocation or termination of management and customer service professionals and a general deterioration of personalized customer service.\nOn January 16, 2014, we announced the completion of our acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. (\"UFBC\"), the holding company of The Business Bank (\"TBB\"), pursuant to a previously announced definitive merger agreement. The merger of UFBC into Cardinal was effective January 16, 2014. Under the terms of the merger agreement, UFBC shareholders received $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our common stock in exchange for each share of UFBC common stock they owned immediately prior to the merger. TBB, which was headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, merged into Cardinal Bank effective March 8, 2014.\nWe own Cardinal Bank (the \"Bank\"), a Virginia state-chartered community bank with 31 banking offices located in Northern Virginia and the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers. Our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors, commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals, such as physicians, accountants and attorneys.\nAdditionally, we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries, including mortgage banking through George Mason Mortgage, LLC (\"George Mason\") and retail securities brokerage though Cardinal Wealth Services, Inc. (\"CWS\").\nPrior to June 30, 2013, the Bank had a trust division, Cardinal Trust and Investment Services. This division merged its remaining operations as of June 30, 2013 into CWS. In addition, as of June 30, 2013, Wilson/Bennett Capital Management, Inc., formerly the Company's second nonbank subsidiary, merged its operations into CWS. During the second quarter of 2013, we exited the third party institutional custody and trustee component of our trust services division due to our limited opportunity to leverage this platform. As a result of our reorganization of the wealth management business segment, the remaining personal and commercial trust area of this business consolidated into CWS. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries.\nWe had a second mortgage subsidiary, Cardinal First Mortgage, LLC (\"Cardinal First\") based in Fairfax, Virginia, but as of June 30, 2013, this subsidiary merged into George Mason to improve operational efficiency. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries.\nGeorge Mason, based in Fairfax, Virginia, engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through 17 offices located throughout the metropolitan Washington region. George Mason does business in eight states, primarily Virginia and Maryland, and the District of Columbia. George Mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, generating originations of approximately $3.6 billion in 2015 and $3.0 billion in 2014. George Mason's primary sources of revenue include loan origination fees, net interest income earned on loans held for sale, and gains on sales of loans. At the time we enter into an interest rate lock arrangement with the borrower, we enter into a loan forward sale commitment with a third party. Our mortgage loans are then sold servicing released.\nGeorge Mason also offers a construction-to-permanent loan program. This program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences. Once the home has been completed, the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market. These\nconstruction-to-permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for George Mason and are classified as loans held for sale.\nThe mortgage banking segment's business is both cyclical and seasonal. The cyclical nature of its business is influenced by, among other factors, the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates, national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy. Historically, the mortgage banking segment has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year. However, the decrease in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2015 increased refinancing activity for George Mason as it did for other mortgage banking entities, and contributed to our increased loan origination activity for the full 2015 year as compared to 2014.\nWilson/Bennett provided asset management services to certain of our customers. Wilson/Bennett's primary source of revenue was management fees earned on the assets it managed for its customers. These management fees were generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets. As part of our reorganization of the wealth management services business segment, we merged Wilson/Bennett operations into CWS as of June 30, 2013.\nWe formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Cardinal Statutory Trust I, for the purpose of issuing $20.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (\"trust preferred securities\"). These trust preferred securities are due in 2034 and pay interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 2.40%, which adjusts quarterly. These securities are redeemable at par. The interest rate on this debt was 2.91% at December 31, 2015. We have guaranteed payment of these securities. The $20.6 million payable by us to Cardinal Statutory Trust I is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity. We utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the Bank.\nIn connection with the UFBC acquisition, we acquired all of the voting and common shares of UFBC Capital Trust I (the \"UFBC Trust\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary established for the sole purpose of issuing $5.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. These trust preferred securities are due in 2035 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.10%, which adjusts quarterly. At December 31, 2015, the interest rate on trust preferred securities was 2.61%. The UFBC Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary since we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity. The additional $155,000 that is payable by us to the UFBC Trust represents the unfunded capital investment in the UFBC Trust.\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue. We define revenue as net interest income plus non-interest income. As discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section, we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize, and concurrently stabilize, net interest income. We do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but are unable to eliminate it entirely. In addition to managing interest rate risk, we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk. Loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry, and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit. In addition to net interest income, non-interest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes, among other things, service charges on deposits and loans, investment fee income, gains and losses on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and gains on sales of mortgage loans.\nNet interest income and non-interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue, which is calculated as net interest income plus non-interest income, for the three years ended December 31, 2015:\n\nNon-interest income represented a larger portion of our total revenue for 2015 relative to 2014 as a result of a significant increase in gains realized and unrealized on mortgage loans held for sale. In addition to an increase in originations in 2015 compared to 2014, we also experienced an increase in gain on sale margins of approximately 20 basis points which was result of implementing our mandatory delivery loan sale program during the last six months of 2015. For 2014, non-interest income was a larger portion of our total revenue base compared to 2013 as the rate compression we experienced on gain on sale margins for loans sold during 2013 subsided during 2014 as the interest rate environment was not as volatile during 2014 as compared to 2013.\n2015 Economic Environment\nThe banking environment and the markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. and global economies, as well as the continued implementation of rulemaking from recent financial reforms. The U.S. economy grew during 2015 for the seventh consecutive year. While economic growth struggled to reach 2% during 2015, the labor market continued to improve. Employment gains were generally steady as the national unemployment rate fell to 5.0% by year end. With steady employment gains and continued low oil prices, consumer spending increased at a strong pace for most of 2015 and residential construction gained momentum. Nationally, home prices continued to rise by more than 5% during 2015 as equity markets remained fairly unchanged. U.S. Treasury yields were unstable during 2015 but began to rise modestly over the year as a Federal Reserve rate increase was expected. At its final meeting in 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee raised its targeted Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, its first rate increase in over nine years.\nAlthough global economic conditions remain unsettled, the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, the region we operate in, continued to perform relatively well, compared to other regions. As we believe that our region has weathered the recession better than most over the past several years, a protracted low interest rate environment, and the burden of regulatory requirements enacted in response to the recent financial crisis made for a challenging 2015. The housing industry and unemployment indicators improved during 2015 compared to 2014, where the effect of federal sequestration and spending cuts dampened economic growth and employment in defense-related professional and business service sectors. Progress in the near future for employment and the housing industry is uncertain given the prospect for higher long-term interest rates. We continue to consider future economic events and their impact on our performance.\nThe unemployment rate in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area decreased in tandem to the national unemployment rate to 3.8%, and commercial and residential real estate values held up well compared to other regions.\nOur credit quality continues to remain strong despite the challenging economic environment. At December 31, 2015, we had nonaccrual loans totaling $451,000 and no loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing. We recorded annualized net recoveries of 0.07% of our average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of a decrease in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2015, refinancing originations from our mortgage\nbanking segment increased significantly during 2015 to 31% of total originations for the full year 2015 compared to 21% of total originations for 2014.\nMarket illiquidity and concerns over credit risk continue to impact the ratings of our pooled trust preferred securities. We hold investments of $3.8 million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities, which are significantly below book value as of December 31, 2015 due to the lack of liquidity in the market, deferrals and defaults of issuers, and continued investor apprehension for investing in these types of investments.\nWe expect challenging economic and operating conditions and an evolving regulatory regime to continue for the foreseeable future. These conditions could continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results for 2016. The degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions and the nature of new banking regulations.\nWhile our loan growth has continued to be strong, continued uncertainty and sluggish economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which would adversely impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in real estate values and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially. The systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries also may not function as we have anticipated.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The primary sources of funding for our Bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects a third party or us. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events. While we believe we have a healthy liquidity position, any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future.\nThe U.S. government continues to enact legislation and develop various programs and initiatives designed to stabilize the financial services industry, stabilize the housing markets and stimulate the economy. The banking industry is awaiting many of the regulations resulting from the implementation of the Financial Reform Act. We remain unsure of the full impact this legislation will have on our business, operations or our financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. Management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. These policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such judgments, assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Actual results, in fact, could differ from initial estimates.\nThe accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses, accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans, the fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities, accounting for economic hedging activities, accounting for impairment testing of goodwill, accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management's best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers. Unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, may impact our assessment of possible credit losses. As a part of its analysis, we use our historical losses, loss emergence experience and qualitative factors, such as levels of and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charged-off loans, changes in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience and ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of credit, competition, and loan review results to support estimates.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of the loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments. For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on class segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For purposes of this analysis, we categorize loans into one of five categories: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate (including construction), home equity lines of credit, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. We also maintain an allowance for loan losses for acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded at the time of acquisition.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we transitioned to using its historical loss experience and trends in losses for each category which were then adjusted for portfolio trends and economical and environmental factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. The indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied to each of the five categories of loans. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the allowance model used the average loss rates of similar institutions based on its custom peer group as a baseline, which was adjusted for its particular loan portfolio characteristics and environmental factors. These changes did not have an impact to the overall allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment. We individually assigns loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes, as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent. In certain cases, we apply, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, a 5% loss factor to all loans classified as special mention, a 15% loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a 50% loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful. Loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged-off. However, in most instances, we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis for those loans that are adversely risk rated. For these loans, we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and considers estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis. If the net collateral value is less than the loan balance (including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan) we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan. Because of the limited number of impaired loans within the portfolio, we are able to evaluate each impaired loan individually and therefore specific reserves for impaired loans are generally less than those recommended by the listed regulatory guidelines above.\nThe general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. To arrive at the general component, the loan portfolio is grouped by loan type. A weighted average historical loss rate is computed for each group of loans over the trailing seven year period. We selected a seven year evaluation period as a result of the limited historical loss experience we have incurred, even during the recent economic downturn. We also believe that a seven year time horizon represents a full economic cycle. The historical loss factors are updated at least annually, unless a more frequent review of such factors is warranted. In addition to the use of historical loss factors, a qualitative adjustment factor is applied. This qualitative adjustment factor, which may be favorable or unfavorable, represents management's judgment that inherent losses in a given group of loans are different from historical loss rates due to environmental factors unique to that specific group of loans. These factors may relate to growth rate factors within the particular loan group; whether the recent loss history for a particular group of loans differs from its historical loss rate; the amount of loans in a particular group that have recently been designated as impaired and that may be indicative of future trends for this group; reported or observed difficulties that other banks are having with loans in the particular group; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending personnel; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans; and changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and adversely classified loans. The sum of the historical loss rate and the qualitative adjustment factor comprise the estimated annual loss rate. To adjust for inherent loss levels within the loan portfolio, a loss emergence factor is estimated based on an evaluation of the period of time it takes for a loan within each of our loan segments to deteriorate to the point an impairment loss is recorded within the allowance. The loss emergence factor is applied to the estimated annual loss rate to determine the expected annual loss amount.\nCredit losses are an inherent part of our business and, although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are appropriate, it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment. Additional provisions for such losses, if necessary, would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments, as appropriate, and would negatively impact earnings.\nAllowance for Loan Losses-Acquired Loans\nAcquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30\nFor our acquired loans, to the extent that we experience a deterioration in borrower credit quality resulting in a decrease in our expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition of the loans, an allowance for loan losses would be established based on our estimate of future credit losses over the remaining life of the loans.\nAcquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-20\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, we establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation process that is similar to our evaluation process used for originated loans. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, carrying value of the loans, which includes the remaining net purchase discount or premium, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses.\nPurchased Credit-Impaired Loans\nPurchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which are the loans acquired in our acquisition of UFBC, are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). These loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no allowance for loan losses. We account for interest income on all loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality) based on the acquired loans' expected cash flows. The acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flow. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loans, or the \"accretable yield,\" is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses on these impaired pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (representing the present value of all cash flows that were expected at acquisition but currently are not expected to be received). At December 31, 2015, there was no reserve for impairment of PCI loans within our allowance for loan losses.\nWe periodically evaluate the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Changes in the contractual required payments due and estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and non-accretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. On an aggregate basis, if the acquired pools of PCI loans perform better than originally expected, we would expect to receive more future cash flows than originally modeled at the acquisition date. For the pools with better than expected cash flows, the forecasted increase would be recorded as an additional accretable yield that is recognized as a prospective increase to our interest income on loans.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Our investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry-wide valuation service. This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. For certain of our held-to-maturity investment securities where there is minimal observable trading activity, we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value based on internal calculations and compare our results to information provided by external pricing sources.\nWe also fair value our interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales commitments. The fair value of our interest rate lock commitments considers the expected premium (discount) to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan. In addition, we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination, and then period end, using applicable published mortgage-backed investment security prices. The fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date. At loan closing, the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is included in the cost basis of loans held for sale, which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.\nAccounting for Economic Hedging Activities\nWe record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For derivatives designated as hedges, we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness. We evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective. In situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contractual commitments, including rate lock commitments, to finance residential mortgage loans. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings.\nTo mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments, we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts. During the rate lock commitment period, these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value elements of the rate lock commitment related to servicing and the wholesale and retail rate spread, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. At the closing of the loan, the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract. The forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale. Loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.\nAccounting for Impairment Testing of Goodwill\nWe have adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-08 (\"ASU 2011-08\"), Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This ASU permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform the two-step impairment test. We perform our annual review of the goodwill during the third quarter.\nIn the event we are required to perform a Step 1 fair value evaluation of the reporting unit, we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit. This discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including: estimated future\ncash flows from operations; an estimate of a terminal value; a discount rate; and other inputs. Our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows. If the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nAccounting for the Impairment of Amortizing Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe continually review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable. We evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows, before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis, with the net book value of long-term assets, including amortizable intangible assets. If undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets, further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment.\nAn impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values. Fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods. When substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset, the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered. Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes.\nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-04, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure (\"ASU No. 2014-04\"), which clarifies when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. An in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs upon either the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Additionally, this ASU requires interim and annual disclosure of both the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. ASU No. 2014-04 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-04 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-01, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects (\"ASU No. 2014-01\"), which amends existing guidance to permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their\ninvestments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense or benefit. For those investments in qualified affordable housing projects not accounted for using the proportional amortization method, the investment should be accounted for as an equity method investment or a cost method investment in accordance with Subtopic 970-323. ASU No. 2014-01 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-01 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a framework that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, for public entities. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. This ASU changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. Additionally, for repurchase financing arrangements, the amendments of this ASU require separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. The requirements are effective for public entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2014. The disclosure of certain transactions accounted for as a sale is required to be presented for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and the disclosure for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as securities borrowings is required to be presented for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of ASU No. 2014-01 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides an acquired entity an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. This ASU is effective for public business entities on November 18, 2014. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this guidance.\nFinancial Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $47.3 million on a consolidated basis. The commercial banking segment recorded net income of $39.2 million and our mortgage banking segment recorded net income of $9.2 million. The wealth management services business segment reported net income of $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income of $32.7 million on a consolidated basis. The commercial banking segment recorded net income of $34.4 million and our mortgage banking segment recorded a net loss of $2.7 million. The wealth management services business segment reported net income of $135,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nAt December 31, 2015, total assets were $4.03 billion, an increase of 18.6%, or $630.8 million, from $3.40 billion at December 31, 2014. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 18.4%, or $475.2 million, to $3.06 billion at December 31, 2015, from $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014. Total investment securities increased by $75.6 million, or 21.7%, to $423.8 million\nat December 31, 2015, from $348.2 million at December 31, 2014. Total deposits increased 19.6%, or $497.4 million, to $3.03 billion at December 31, 2015, from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014. Other borrowed funds, which primarily include customer repurchase agreements, federal funds sold and Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances, increased $100.0 million to $538.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $438.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $413.1 million, an increase of $35.8 million from $377.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $47.3 million less dividends paid to shareholders totaling $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased shareholders' equity $3.1 million during 2015. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively. Book value per share at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12.76 and $11.76, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.37% at December 31, 2015 compared to 11.78% at December 31, 2014. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded net income of $47.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $32.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, in 2014. Net interest income increased $8.7 million to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a result of increase in interest earning assets. Provision for loan losses was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.9 million for 2014. Non-interest income increased $13.5 million to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $39.2 million for 2014 due primarily to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking business segment. Non-interest expense was $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase in salaries and benefits expense during 2015 was offset by a decrease in merger and acquisition expense as we added to the sales and operational staffing areas of the Company over the past year as a result of our continued growth and increased regulatory environment in addition to an increase in the variable component of compensation expense.\nThe return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 1.29% and 1.02%, respectively. The return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 11.76% and 8.82%, respectively.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nAt December 31, 2014, total assets were $3.40 billion, an increase of 17.5%, or $504.9 million, from $2.89 billion at December 31, 2013. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 26.5%, or $540.9 million, to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.04 billion at December 31, 2013. Total investment securities decreased by $11.5 million, or 3.2%, to $348.2 million at December 31, 2014, from $359.7 million at December 31, 2013. Total deposits increased 23.1%, or $476.5 million, to $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2013. Other borrowed funds decreased $37.2 million to $438.0 million at December 31, 2014, from $475.2 million at December 31, 2013.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 was $377.3 million, an increase of $56.8 million from $320.5 million at December 31, 2013. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the shares issued as a result of our acquisition of UFBC. For each share of UFBC common stock outstanding, the shareholders of UFBC received a fixed exchange ratio of $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our\ncommon stock. We issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and added $25.2 million in additional paid in capital for a total of $26.8 million in additional capital. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income added $5.3 million in capital offset by dividends paid to common shareholders of $10.9 million during 2014. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11.1%. Book value per share at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.76 and $10.57, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.78% at December 31, 2014 compared to 12.89% at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2014.\nWe recorded net income of $32.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net income of $25.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, in 2013. Net interest income increased $15.4 million to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a result of increase in interest earning assets and strategically decreasing the rates we pay on our deposits. Provision for loan losses was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a benefit of $32,000 for 2013. Non-interest income increased $9.3 million to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $29.9 million for 2013 due primarily to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking business segment. Non-interest expense was $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.6 million, or 13.7%, compared to $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expense, occupancy expense, and expenses attributable to our acquisition of UFBC.\nThe return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 1.02% and 0.92%, respectively. The return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 8.82% and 7.96%, respectively.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. It represents non-interest expense as a percentage of net interest income and non-interest income. The lower the percentage, the more efficient we are operating. We believe use of the efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides additional clarity in assessing our operating results.\nSee the table below for the components of our calculation of our efficiency ratio as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Our efficiency ratio decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014 because of a combined increase in net interest income and non-interest income, specifically income related to our mortgage banking business segment, while maintaining non-interest expense during 2015 at the same level as for 2014.\nEfficiency Ratio Calculation\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n\n(1)Efficiency ratio is calculated as total non-interest expense divided by the total of net interest income and non-interest income\nStatements of Income\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue, representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates. Interest rates have remained at historic lows for the last several years as the Federal Reserve has had an extremely accommodative policy. We expect this low interest rate environment to discontinue during 2016 as the Federal Reserve has begun to gradually increase the targeted federal funds rate with its first rate increase of 0.25% in nearly a decade in December 2015. See \"Interest Rate Sensitivity\" for further information.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates on Interest-Earning Assets and Interest-Bearing Liabilities\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\n\n(1)Non-accrual loans are included in average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield. Interest income on non-accruing loans was not material for the years presented.\n(2)Interest income for loans receivable and investment securities available-for-sale is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis at a rate of 34% for 2015, 35% for 2014 and 32% for 2013.\nRate and Volume Analysis\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\n\n(1)Non-accrual loans are included in average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield. Interest income on non-accruing loans was not material for the years presented.\n(2)Interest income for loans receivable and investment securities available-for-sale is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis at a rate of 34% for 2015 and 33% for 2014.\n(3)Changes attributable to rate/volume have been allocated to volume.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $116.4 million, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $8.7 million, or 8.1%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase in the volume of interest-earning assets during 2015 compared to 2014. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 23 basis points to 4.06% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 4.29% for the same period of 2014. To offset this decrease in yield, during the first quarter of 2015, we reduced our wholesale funding costs related to other borrowed funds by 30 basis points as we restructured a portion of our fixed rate FHLB advance portfolio. This restructuring reduced our FHLB advance funding costs from 3.33% to 2.80%.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 3.37% and 3.59%, respectively. The decrease in our net interest margin was primarily a result\nof a decrease in the yields on our interest-earning assets partially offset by a slight decrease in the costs related to our interest-bearing liabilities during 2015. Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, is a financial measure that we believe provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use our federal statutory tax rates for the periods presented. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.06% in 2015 from 4.29% in 2014. Total average earning assets increased by 15.5% to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.04 billion at December 31, 2014 which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $12.1 million to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $130.3 million 2014. The increase in our earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in average loans receivable of $397.3 million, which contributed to an additional $17.5 million in interest income on a tax equivalent basis for 2015. This increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio which decreased interest income $6.4 million on a tax equivalent basis. The increase in loans receivable during 2015 was attributable to organic growth. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2015 and 2014. Additional interest income of approximately $201,000 for 2015 and $866,000 for 2014 would have been realized had all nonperforming loans performed as originally expected. Nonperforming loans exclude those loans that are both past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest due to an assessment of collectibility.\nAs a result of the significant increase in loan origination activity that occurred at George Mason during 2015, average balances for loans held for sale increased $56.2 million to $344.5 million and resulted in an increase in interest income from loans held for sale of $1.1 million to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 201. The increase in outstanding balances in the loans held for sale portfolio during 2015 contributed to the increase in other borrowed funds as we use wholesale funding in the form of brokered certificates of deposits and FHLB advances to help fund this loan portfolio.\nTotal average interest-bearing deposits increased $361.7 million to $2.21 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.85 billion at December 31, 2014. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $65.1 million to $619.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $553.9 million at December 31, 2014. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our certificates of deposit, which increased $261.2 million compared to 2014. Average brokered certificates of deposit increased $120.9 million during 2015. This change in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities increased our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.73% in 2015 from 0.66% in 2014. The cost of other borrowed funds, which generally are shorter term fundings used to help fund our balance sheet growth and support our loans held for sale portfolio, decreased 30 basis points to 2.00% in 2015 from 2.30% in 2014, a result of the aforementioned FHLB advance restructuring we completed during the first quarter of 2015. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 3 basis points to 0.92% in 2015 from 0.95% in 2014 as a result of the aforementioned changes in funding sources.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $107.7 million, compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $15.4 million, or 16.6%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of the interest-earning assets we acquired from UFBC in addition to the organic growth that occurred during 2014. We also continued to strategically decrease rates on our deposit products as a result of the low interest rate environment during 2014.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 3.59% and 3.52%, respectively. The increase in our net interest margin was primarily a result of a decrease in the yields on our interest-bearing liabilities offset partially by a slight decrease in the yields over our interest-earning assets.\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.29% in 2014 from 4.33% in 2013. Total average earning assets increased by 14.4% to $3.04 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $2.66 billion at December 31, 2013 which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $15.1 million to $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $115.2 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in our earnings assets was primarily driven by an increase in average loans receivable of $516.7 million, which contributed to an additional $23.3 million in interest income on a tax equivalent basis for 2014. This increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio which decreased interest income $5.2 million on a tax equivalent basis. The increase in loans receivable during 2014 was a combination of loans acquired of $238.3 million during the year with the remaining increase in loans attributable to organic growth. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2014 and 2013. Additional interest income of approximately $866,000 for 2014 and $626,000 for 2013 would have been realized had all nonperforming loans performed as originally expected.\nAs a result of the significant decrease in loan origination activity that occurred at George Mason during 2014, average balances for loans held for sale decreased $118.4 million to $288.3 million and resulted in a decrease in interest income from loans held for sale of $4.5 million to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result of the decrease in our loans held for sale portfolio, we invested the excess cash (which was earning 0.25% in federal funds sold) through purchases of $47.7 million in investment securities during 2014. The decrease in outstanding balances in the loans held for sale portfolio during 2014 contributed to the decrease in other borrowed funds.\nTotal average interest-bearing deposits increased $142.4 million to $1.85 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $1.71 billion at December 31, 2013. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $139.8 million to $553.9 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $414.2 million at December 31, 2013. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our interest checking, which increased $52.8 million compared to 2013. Average brokered certificates of deposit decreased $27.3 million during 2014. These changes in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities assisted in us decreasing our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.66% in 2014 from 0.76% in 2013. The cost of other borrowed funds, decreased 68 basis points to 2.30% in 2014 from 2.98% in 2013, a result of our paying off certain FHLB advances at maturity as the loans held for sale portfolio decreased. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 14 basis points to 0.95% in 2014 from 1.09% in 2013 as a result of the aforementioned changes in funding sources.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk. Our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk. Management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain. We manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee (\"ALCO\"). ALCO is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management.\nWe employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity. We use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity. Many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are\ndeveloped for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the current balance sheet, the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions, the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged. This is considered the base case. Next, the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down 100 basis points and up 200 basis points. The down 200 basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates. In the ramped down rate change, the model moves rates gradually down 100 basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year.\nFor the up 200 basis point scenario, rates are gradually moved up 200 basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year. In both the up and down scenarios, the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case.\nAt December 31, 2015, our asset/liability position was slightly asset sensitive based on our interest rate sensitivity model. Our net interest income would decrease by less than 1.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 2.0% in an up 200 basis point scenario over a one-year time frame. In the two-year time horizon, our net interest income would decrease by less than 2.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 2.9% in an up 200 basis point scenario.\nProvision Expense and Allowance for Loan Losses\nOur policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers.\nWe recorded a provision of $1.4 million for our loan loss provisioning for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was $31.7 million compared to $28.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our allowance for loan loss ratio as a percent of total loans at December 31, 2015 was 1.04% compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2014. The decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is a result of improved credit quality during 2015.\nDuring 2015 the credit quality in our loan portfolio remained strong, as we have experienced decreases in our nonperforming assets as compared to historical periods and net recoveries as we work out our problem credits. During 2014, our level of nonperforming assets increased as we acquired several impaired loans that were held within the UFBC loan portfolio. These impaired loans had been on nonaccrual status prior to the acquisition date or had demonstrated that there was with limited possibility for improvement and therefore we placed such loans on nonaccrual. The decrease in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 was a result of three nonperforming loans paying off in total and selling three nonperforming loan relationships. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded charge-offs of $291,000 related to commercial, residential and consumer loans. Recoveries from previously charged-off loans totaled $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, most of which were related to commercial loans. Of the recoveries recorded, one was previously a troubled debt restructuring.\nAnnualized net loan recoveries was 0.07% of average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to annualized net loan charge-offs of 0.06% of average loans receivable\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014. Nonaccrual loans (less interest and credit marks assigned to PCI loans) totaled $451,000 at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nA sluggish job market and declining home values could adversely affect our home equity lines of credit, credit card and other loan portfolios, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. At December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate portfolio (including construction lending) portfolio was 67.8% of our total loan portfolio. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our business, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level or our credit exposure to individual entities and industries, may not function as we have anticipated.\nThe provision for loan losses was a benefit of $32,000 for 2013. We recorded net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaling $496,000.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Policies\" above for more information on our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nThe following tables present additional information pertaining to the activity in and allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type and the percentage of the loan type to the total loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\n\n\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\n\n\n*Percentage of loan type to the total loan portfolio.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table provides detail for non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nNon-Interest Income\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\n\nNon-interest income includes service charges on deposits and loans, realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities, investment fee income, and gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and continues to be an important factor in our operating results. Non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $52.7 million and $39.2 million, respectively.\nThe increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014, is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking segment. Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased $11.4 million to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $32.1 million for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $43.5 million, which was comprised of $39.7 million in realized gains and a $3.8 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $32.1 million, which was comprised of $28.7 million in realized gains and a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. In addition to the increase in origination activity, the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities was impacted by an increase in gain on sale margins during 2015 as compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed $3.6 billion in mortgage originations compared to $3.0 billion in 2014. Refinance activity represented approximately 31% of the originations during 2015, an increase from 21% experienced during 2014.\nIn accordance with GAAP, if a lender enters into a mortgage loan commitment with a customer and intends to sell the mortgage loan after it is funded, the written loan commitment is to be accounted for as a derivative instrument and is to be recorded at fair value through earnings. George Mason enters into commitments where individual loans are \"locked in\" at a specified interest rate for a\nfixed period. At the time of commitment, George Mason also enters into a \"best efforts\" forward contract with an investor to sell the loan at an agreed upon price if, and after, the loan is closed. This price represents the fair value of the \"interest rate lock commitment\" (IRLC) and is an unrealized gain that is included in earnings during the period of the IRLC. This gain is also recognized earlier in earnings than the expenses associated with originating, underwriting and closing the loan, which, under GAAP, are recognized and deferred by the Company at the time of loan sale to the investor. When the loan actually closes, the unrealized gain is added to the basis of the ensuing loan held for sale (LHFS). At any point in time (e.g. quarter end) the fair value of the existing IRLCs (not yet closed) and the premium to the basis of existing LHFS (loans closed but not yet purchased by investors) represent unrealized gains that have been recognized in income, either in the current period or prior periods. At the time the loan is sold to investors, the \"investor buy price\" is equal to the basis of the loan held for sale, and there is no gain or loss recognized. This accounting creates a mismatch between the income recognition on loan production and the expense recognition for those same loans. Direct costs associated with the loan origination, such as commissions and salaries, are recorded as a reduction to realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities.\nMaintaining our revenue stream in the mortgage banking segment is dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors at or near current volumes. Over the last several years, we have increased our mortgage banking presence to include the Richmond and Virginia Beach areas of the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by less refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our net income.\nInvestment fee income decreased $227,000 to $489,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $716,000 for 2014. Investment fee income includes net commissions earned at CWS during 2015 and 2014.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $124,000 to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Service charges on deposit accounts include insufficient funds fee income, service charges on deposit accounts, other fee income on deposit accounts and ATM transaction fees as shown in the table above. Loan fees totaled $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $399,000, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in loan fee income is a result of a decrease in prepayment penalties during 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, income from bank-owned life insurance was $433,000, a decrease of $50,000 when compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease is a result of the decrease in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank-owned life insurance.\nWe recorded trading gains of $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to trading gains of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have purchased investments to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability. These investments are designated as trading securities, and as such, the changes in fair value are reflected in earnings. These trading gains were primarily the result of increased stock prices and were mostly offset by a compensation expense associated with this benefit plan.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded gains on the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million.\nDuring 2015, we recorded a litigation settlement of $3.0 million which also contributed to the increase in noninterest income for 2015.\nNon-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $39.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively. The increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the same period of 2013, is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities from our mortgage banking segment. Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased $10.4 million to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $21.6 million for 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $32.1 million, which was comprised of $28.7 million in realized gains and a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $21.6 million, which was comprised of $36.7 million in realized gains and a $15.1 million decrease in the fair value of rate lock commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we closed $3.0 billion in mortgage originations compared to $5.8 billion in 2013. Refinance activity represented approximately 21% of the originations during 2014, a decrease from 33% experienced during 2013.\nThe increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is a result of the increase in gain on sale margins we experienced during 2014 as compared to 2013. In addition, the change in the unrealized portion of our gains on loan sales was an increase of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a decrease of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nManagement fee income, which represented the income earned for services George Mason provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders and generally fluctuated based on the volume of loan sales, decreased to $21,000 during 2014 compared to $2.0 million in 2013. The decrease in management fee income is a result of the discontinuation of all of our remaining managed company relationships within the last year.\nInvestment fee income decreased $621,000 to $716,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1.3 million for 2013. Investment fee income includes net commissions earned at CWS during 2014 and for 2013, income earned at Wilson/Bennett and from our trust division prior to the completion of the aforementioned wealth management reorganization as of June 30, 2013.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $178,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Loan fees totaled $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $548,000, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Title insurance and other income totaled $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $987,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in title insurance and other income is primarily a result of our closing George Mason's title company as new regulations impaired our ability to maintain a level of profitability within this subsidiary.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, income from bank-owned life insurance was $483,000, an decrease of $72,000 when compared to the same period of 2013. The increase is a result of the increase in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank-owned life insurance.\nWe recorded trading gains of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to trading gains of $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded gains on the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table reflects the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\n\nNon-interest expense includes, among other things, salaries and benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, depreciation, data processing, telecommunications and miscellaneous expenses. Non-interest expense was $96.3 million and $96.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $5.8 million to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $46.0 million for 2014. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily related to increases in our business development personnel in our commercial banking and mortgage banking segments. We added commercial lenders at the Bank and increased back office staffing levels due to our increased regulatory environment. In addition, the variable component of our compensation expense increased during 2015 as a result of our 2015 performance.\nOccupancy expense decreased $480,000 to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $10.3 million for 2014. The decrease in occupancy expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the closing of several branch office locations during 2014 and one in 2015. As a result of our UFBC acquisition, we had five branch offices that overlapped existing markets. Decreases in depreciation expense of $324,000, data processing and communications of $840,000, and merger and acquisitions expense of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 can be attributed to the acquisition of UFBC during 2014 and the cost savings we received post acquisition.\nProfessional fees increased $1.5 million to $4.6 million for 2015 compared to $3.1 million for 2014. The increase in professional fees during 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees as a result of litigation which was settled during the second quarter of 2015 and an increase in external audit and accounting fees from prior year's engagement.\nAdvertising and marketing expense decreased $906,000 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5.1 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease in marketing and advertising expense was a result of the branch expansion that occurred during 2014 as a result of branch acquisitions and de novo growth. No similar expansion occurred during 2015.\nMortgage loan repurchases and settlements for 2015 was $397,000 compared to $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to one settlement related to the previous financial crisis. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to limit our exposure to loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors. Given the steps that have been taken to limit our exposure coupled with the passage of time and the expiration of the statute of limitations for loans originated in certain prior years, our current expectation is that future putback claims will be limited in number. We evaluate the individual merits of each claim, and recognize an expense when settlement is deemed probable and the amount of such a settlement is estimable.\nNon-interest expense was $96.2 million and $84.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $11.6 million, or 13.7%. The increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily the result of increases in salary and benefits costs, occupancy expense, and expenses related to the acquisition of UFBC during 2014.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $4.4 million to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $41.5 million for 2013. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily related to increases in our business development personnel in our commercial banking and mortgage banking segments. We added commercial lenders at the Bank and opened one de novo banking offices during 2014. In addition, the variable component of our compensation expense increased during 2014 as a result of our 2014 performance.\nOccupancy expense increased $1.9 million to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $8.4 million for 2013. The increase in occupancy expense during 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage origination offices and acquired and de novo banking offices as we strategically increase our market share. Data processing and communications expense increased $1.7 million to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.7 million, a result of the aforementioned increase in locations.\nProfessional fees decreased $643,000 to $3.1 million for 2014 compared to $3.8 million for 2013. The decrease in professional fees during 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to a decrease in temporary staffing that was allocated to George Mason to handle the increase in loan origination volume during the 2013 refinance boom. The level of temporary staffing was maintained at George Mason until the beginning of the third quarter of 2013 when loan origination volume dropped significantly due to the current mortgage market conditions.\nAdvertising and marketing expense increased slightly by $376,000 to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $4.7 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in marketing and advertising expense was a result of the branch expansion that occurred during 2014 as a result of branch acquisitions and de novo growth.\nMortgage loan repurchases and settlements for 2014 was $83,000 compared to a benefit of $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nMerger and acquisition expense was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $464,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of our acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. Merger and acquisition related expenses primarily include expenses related to staff reductions, branch office consolidations, contract termination payments and back office systems consolidations.\nWe recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment of $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of the issuance of the Final Rules required by the Financial Reform Act which were released by federal banking agencies in late 2013. The impairment recorded brought the book value of these investments in line with their fair value as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we have recorded in full the impairment loss recorded in 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2015 was 33.7%, compared to 32.9% for 2014. Our effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate because of income we receive on tax-exempt investments and tax credits we have related to low income housing investments.\nWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2013 was 32.3%. See also \"Critical Accounting Policies-Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\".\nStatements of Condition\nLoans Receivable, Net\nTotal loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $3.06 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $475.2 million, or 18.4%, compared to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014. Loans held for sale increased $68.4 million to $383.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $315.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in our inventory of loans held for sale during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the significant increase in loan origination and sales volume, a result of increases in loan originators during 2015 in addition to preferential market conditions during 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (less interest and credit marks for PCI loans) totaling $451,000. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014 totaled $3.4 million. We had no accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. During 2015, our level of nonperforming loans decreased as a result of three nonperforming loans paying off in total and selling three nonperforming loan relationships. Loans that are classified as \"troubled debt restructurings\" at December 31, 2015 totaled $365,000 compared to $289,000 at December 31, 2014.\nInterest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded when cash is received. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income if it was accrued in the current year and is charged to the allowance for loan losses if it was accrued in prior years. While on nonaccrual, the collection of interest is recorded as interest income only after all past-due principal has been collected. When all past contractual obligations are collected and, in our opinion, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to remain current, the loan is returned to an accruing status. At December 31, 2015, the loans on nonaccrual status did not have a valuation allowance. Gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonaccrual loans had been current with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $201,000 and $8666,000, respectively. The interest income realized prior to loans being placed on nonaccrual status for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6,000 and $80,000, respectively.\nTotal loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $2.58 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $540.9 million, or 26.5%, compared to $2.04 billion at December 31, 2013. Loans held for sale decreased $58.7 million to $315.3 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $374.0 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease in our inventory of loans held for sale during 2014 compared to 2013\nis primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination and sales volume, as mortgage rates have increased as a result of market concerns over the ending of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, which had kept interest rate at historic lows.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis totaling $3.4 million (less interest and credit marks for PCI loans). Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2013 totaled $2.3 million. We had no accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. During 2014, our level of nonperforming loans increased as we acquired several impaired loans that were held within the UFBC loan portfolio. These impaired loans had been on nonaccrual status prior to the acquisition date or had demonstrated that there was limited possibility for improvement and therefore we placed such loans on nonaccrual during 2014. Loans that are classified as \"troubled debt restructurings\" at December 31, 2014 totaled $289,000 compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2012.\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.02%, 0.17%, and 0.11% at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe following tables present the composition of our loans receivable portfolio at the end of each of the five years ended December 31, 2015 and additional information on nonperforming loans receivable.\nLoans Receivable\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\n\n\nNonperforming Loans\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011\n(In thousands)\n\nThe following table presents information on loan maturities and interest rate sensitivity.\nLoan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nAt December 31, 2015\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n*Payments due by period are based on the repricing characteristics and not contractual maturities.\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity. The investment portfolio consists of investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities held-to-maturity and trading securities. Investment securities available-for-sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability strategy, liquidity management or regulatory capital management. Investment securities held-to-maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Investment securities-trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability. These securities include cash equivalents, equities and mutual funds. Investment securities were $423.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $75.6 million or 21.7%, from $348.2 million at December 31, 2014. We purchased $144.0 million in investment securities during 2015 as a result of an excess cash position we had at the Bank and to help enhance our net interest margin by investing in higher yielding earning assets.\nOf the $423.8 million in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, $3.8 million were classified as held-to-maturity, $414.1 million were classified as available-for-sale, and $5.9 million were\nclassified as trading securities. At December 31, 2015, the yield on the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 3.20% and the yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.19%.\nWe complete reviews for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2015, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency. Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk. At December 31, 2015, 99% of our mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).\nWe have $947,000 in non-government non-agency mortgage-backed securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. The various protective elements on the non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes, which could impact the ratings of these securities.\nAt December 31, 2015, certain of our investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position. Investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. Contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government. Other mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due. We do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.\nAt December 31, 2015, we owned two pooled trust preferred securities classified as held-to-maturity. The par and carrying values of these securities were each $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. The collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions. We own the A-3 tranches in each issuance. Each of the bonds is rated by more than one rating agency. One security has a composite rating of AA and the other security has a composite rating of A. Observable trading activity remains limited for these types of securities. We have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services. Given the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches, and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral, we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the securities, and concluded that these securities are not other-than-temporarily impaired. We continuously monitor the financial condition of the underlying issues and the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches. We also utilize a multi-scenario model which assumes varying levels of additional defaults and deferrals and the effects of such adverse developments on the contractual cash flows for the A-3 tranches. In each of the adverse scenarios, there was no indication of a break to the A-3 contractual cash flows.\nNo other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized for the securities in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe hold $18.1 million in FHLB stock at December 31, 2015 which is included in other investments on the statement of condition.\nInvestment securities were $348.2 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.5 million or 3.2%, from $359.7 million at December 31, 2013. We purchased $48.0 million in investment securities during 2014 as a result of an excess cash position we had at the Bank due to the decrease in our loans held for sale portfolio.\nOf the $348.2 million in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2014, $4.0 million were classified as held-to-maturity, $339.1 million were classified as available-for-sale, and $5.1 million were classified as trading securities. At December 31, 2014, the yield on the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 3.44% and the yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.13%.\nThe following table reflects the composition of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nInvestment Securities\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeposits and Other Borrowed Funds\nTotal deposits were $3.03 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $497.4 million, or 19.6%, from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in total deposits during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to our deposit gathering efforts and in increase in wholesale deposit fundings during 2015. We have had success in attracting deposit balances from customers seeking to deposit their money with smaller, local banks and depositors are increasing balances held with financial institutions as a result of the increased protection of their money by the FDIC.\nWe use short term brokered CDs to assist us in funding our loans held for sale portfolio. Brokered certificates of deposit increased to $407.0 million at December 31, 2015, of which $67.0 million were placed in the CDARS program. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service (\"CDARS\"). CDARS allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit. When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, funds are placed into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. Brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2014 were $310.4 million, of which $32.3 million were in the CDARS program.\nOther borrowed funds, which primarily include federal funds purchased, customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and our payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, were $538.0 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $100.0 million, from $438.0 million at December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the increase in other borrowed funds at December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $115.0 million to $355.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $240.0 million at December 31, 2013. These advances were primarily used to assist in funding loans receivable originations at the Bank during 2015.\nOther borrowed funds at each of December 31, 2015 and 2014, included $20.6 million payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, the issuer of our trust preferred securities. This debt had an interest rate of 2.91% and 2.64% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated entity as we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust.\nIn connection with the UFBC acquisition, we acquired all of the voting and common shares of UFBC Capital Trust I (the \"UFBC Trust\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary established for the sole purpose of issuing $5.0 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. These trust preferred securities are due in 2035 and have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.10%, which adjusts quarterly. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the interest rate on trust preferred securities was 2.61% and 2.34%, respectively. The UFBC Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary since we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity.\nAt December 31, 2015, other borrowed funds also included $113.6 million in customer repurchase agreements compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2014. Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2015 was $45.0 million compared to $70.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table reflects the short-term borrowings and other borrowed funds outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Other Borrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2015\n(In thousands)\n\nTotal deposits were $2.54 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $476.5 million, or 23.1%, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase in total deposits during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due the deposits we acquired in our acquisition of UFBC of $295.2 million, and $64.6 million in deposits from a branch office acquisition in Gainesville, Virginia, in addition to organic growth that occurred during the year. We have had success in attracting deposit balances from customers seeking to deposit their money with smaller, local banks and depositors are increasing balances held with financial institutions as a result of the increased protection of their money by the FDIC.\nBrokered certificates of deposit increased to $310.4 million at December 31, 2014, of which $32.3 million were placed in the CDARS program. Brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2013 were $301.2 million, of which $72.7 million were in the CDARS program.\nOther borrowed funds, which primarily include federal funds purchased, customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and our payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, were $438.0 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $37.2 million, from $475.2 million at December 31, 2013. The primary reason for the decrease in other borrowed funds at December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $75 million to $240.0 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $315.0 million at December 31, 2012. These advances were primarily used to assist in funding loans receivable originations at the Bank during 2013.\nOther borrowed funds at each of December 31, 2014 and 2013, included $20.6 million payable to Cardinal Statutory Trust I, the issuer of our trust preferred securities. This debt had an interest rate of 2.64% at each of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Cardinal Statutory Trust I is an unconsolidated entity as we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust.\nAt December 31, 2014, other borrowed funds also included $103.7 million in customer repurchase agreements compared to $94.6 million at December 31, 2013. Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2014 was $70.0 million compared to $45.0 million at December 31, 2013.\nCertificates of Deposit that Meet or Exceed FDIC Insurance Limit\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\n\n\n\n*No-Penalty certificates of deposit can be redeemed at anytime at the request of the depositor.\nBusiness Segment Operations\nWe provide banking and non-banking financial services and products through our subsidiaries. We operate in three business segments, commercial banking, mortgage banking and wealth management services. As of June 30, 2013, we merged operations of our trust division and Wilson/Bennett into CWS, both of which had been included in the wealth management services segment. In addition, as of June 30, 2013, we merged operations of Cardinal First Mortgage, LLC, and merged this subsidiary into George Mason. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include six months of operations of these subsidiaries prior to their closure.\nThe commercial banking segment includes both commercial and consumer lending and provides customers such products as commercial loans, real estate loans, and other business financing and consumer loans. In addition, this segment also provides customers with various deposit products including demand deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit.\nThe mortgage banking segment engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis.\nThe wealth management services segment provides investment and financial services to businesses and individuals, including financial planning, retirement/estate planning, investment management.\nInformation about the reportable segments, and reconciliation of this information to the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 follows.\nSegment Reporting\nDecember 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\nAt and for the Year Ended December 31, 2015:\n\nAt and for the Year Ended December 31, 2014:\n\nAt and for the Year Ended December 31, 2013:\n\nCapital Resources\nCapital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance. Our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence.\nRegulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution. The guidelines define capital as both Tier 1 (which includes common shareholders' equity, defined to include certain debt obligations) and Tier 2 (to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and 45% of unrealized gains in equity securities).\nOn January 1, 2015, the new Basel III regulatory risk-based capital rules became effective. Basel III includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refines the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, which is increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the current rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.\nThis new regulatory standard also provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets related to temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.\nBasel III prescribes a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $413.1 million, an increase of $35.8 million, compared to $377.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $47.3 million less dividends paid to shareholders of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3.1 million during 2015. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively. Book value per share at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12.76 and $11.76, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.37% at December 31, 2015 compared to 11.78% at December 31, 2014 (which was calculated under the previous regulatory capital rules). Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 was $377.3 million, an increase of $56.8 million, compared to $320.5 million at December 31, 2013. The increase in shareholders' equity was attributable to the recognition of net income of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the shares issued as a result of our acquisition of UFBC. For each share of UFBC common stock outstanding, the shareholders of UFBC received a fixed exchange ratio of $19.13 in cash and 1.154 shares of our common stock. We issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and added $25.2 million in additional paid in capital for a total of $26.8 million in additional capital. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income added $5.3 million in capital offset by dividends paid to common shareholders of $10.9 million during 2014. Total shareholders' equity to total assets for each of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11.1%. Book value per share at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.76 and $10.57, respectively. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.78% at\nDecember 31, 2014 compared to 12.89% at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we were considered \"well capitalized\" for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2014.\nAs noted above, regulatory capital levels for the bank and bank holding company meet those established for \"well-capitalized\" institutions. While we are currently considered \"well-capitalized,\" we may from time-to-time find it necessary to access the capital markets to meet our growth objectives or capitalize on specific business opportunities.\nThe following table shows the minimum capital requirement and our capital position at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 for the Company and for the Bank.\nCapital Components\nAt December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n(In thousands)\nCardinal Financial Corporation (Consolidated):\n\nCardinal Bank:\n\nLiquidity\nLiquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers. We must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non-cash items into cash. The objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations, personal service and pricing.\nIn addition to deposits, we have access to the different wholesale funding markets. These markets include the brokered CD market, the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Services (\"CDARS\"). CDARS allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit through our Bank. When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, we place their funds into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. We also maintain secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged. Having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding.\nCash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers.\nWe have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management. For our liquidity management program, we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion. We also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. We believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled $453.4 million at December 31, 2015, or 11.3% of total assets. We held investments that are classified as held-to-maturity in the amount of $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. To maintain ready access to the Bank's secured lines of credit, the Bank has pledged roughly half of its investment securities and a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial & industrial loan portfolios pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at December 31, 2015 was approximately $678.5 million. Borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was approximately $164.8 million at December 31, 2015. These facilities are subject to the FHLB and the Federal Reserve approving disbursement to us. In addition, we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of $315 million available to us. We anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors, provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into a number of long-term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities. These contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us and exclude contractual interest costs, where applicable.\nThe required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2015\n(In thousands)\n\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Credit Risk\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.\nThe Bank's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include deposits\nheld by us, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business.\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. We hold certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.\nA summary of the contract amount of the Bank's exposure to off-balance-sheet risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, is as follows:\n\nCommitments to extend credit of $247.4 million as of December 31, 2015 were related to George Mason's mortgage loan funding commitments and were of a short-term nature. Commitments to extend credit of $1.2 billion primarily have floating rates as of December 31, 2015. It is uncertain as to the amount that we will be required to fund on these commitments as many such arrangements expire with no amount drawn.\nWe have counter-party risk which may arise from the possible inability of George Mason's third-party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts. George Mason works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk. We do not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation. We continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties. We do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations.\nGeorge Mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities. We evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims. We have taken steps to limit our exposure to such loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors. As a result, we received a limited number of additional claims.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, George Mason settled with investors on such loans for a total of $0 and $194,000, respectively. This reserve had a balance of $500,000 and $150,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expense (benefit) related to this reserve for the years ended December 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $397,000, $83,000, and ($49,000), respectively.\nQuarterly Data\nThe following table provides quarterly data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
