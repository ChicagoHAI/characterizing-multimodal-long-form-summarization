Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to address the significant factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. When we use the terms Centrue,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d we mean Centrue Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank,\u201d we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank.\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. All financial information in the following tables is displayed in thousands (000s), except per share data.\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by the use of words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" planned\u201d or potential\u201d or similar expressions.\nThe Company's ability to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company and the subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in: interest rates; general economic conditions; legislative/regulatory changes; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; the quality and composition of the loan or securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the Company's market areas; the Company's implementation of new technologies; the Company's ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of Centrue's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nCentrue's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies are deemed critical:\nSecurities: Securities are classified as available-for-sale when Centrue may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in yields on alternative investments, and for other reasons. They are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. All of Centrue's securities are classified as available-for-sale. For all securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. Due to the limited nature of the market for certain securities, the fair value and potential sale proceeds could be materially different in the event of a sale.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in securities gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\ntheir amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether the loss is temporary or other-than-temporary. If the Company (a) has the intent to sell a debt security or (b) is more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire unrealized loss in earnings as an other-than-temporary loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and (b) the amount of total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company also evaluates whether the decline in fair value of an equity security is temporary or other-than-temporary. In determining whether an unrealized loss on an equity security is temporary or other-than-temporary, management considers various factors including the magnitude and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security to forecasted recovery.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on an estimation computed pursuant to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance and rules stating that the analysis of the allowance for loan losses consists of three components:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Specific Component. The specific credit allocation component is based on an analysis of individual impaired loans over a fixed-dollar amount where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the market price of the loan, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost of sale. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Historical Loss Component. The historical loss component is mathematically based using a modified loss migration analysis that examines historical loan loss experience for each loan category. The loss migration is performed quarterly and loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience. The general portfolio allocation element of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of the amounts necessary for concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume. The methodology utilized by management to calculate the historical loss portion of the allowance adequacy analysis is based on historical losses. This historical loss period is based on a weighted twelve-quarter average (3 years); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Qualitative Component. The qualitative component requires qualitative judgment and estimates reserves based on general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors believed to be relevant to the markets in which the Company operates. The process for determining the allowance (which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses) includes subjective elements and, therefore, may be susceptible to significant change.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> To the extent actual outcomes differs from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the Company's earnings or financial position in future periods.\nOther Real Estate Owned: Other real estate owned includes properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans. Properties are recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of other real estate owned. Any write-downs of the properties subsequent to acquisition, as well as gains or losses on disposition and income or expense from the operations of other real estate owned, are recognized in operating results in the period they are realized.\nIncome Taxes: We determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences result in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nWe assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management makes judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nManagement also makes certain interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of the tax position may not be certain. Uncertain tax positions are periodically evaluated and we may establish tax reserves for benefits that may not be realized. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 11 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nCentrue Financial Corporation is a bank holding company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company provides a full range of products and services to individual and corporate customers extending from the far western and southern suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area across Central Illinois down to the metropolitan St. Louis area. These products and services include demand, time, and savings deposits; lending; mortgage banking, brokerage, asset management, and trust services. Brokerage, asset management, and trust services are provided to our customers on a referral basis to third party providers. The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions, including banks, thrifts and credit unions, as well as nonfinancial institutions providing financial services. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiary, Centrue Bank, are subject to regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income (Loss)\n2015 compared to 2014. Net income equaled $42.6 million or $11.08 per common diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a net loss of $4.5 million or $(44.81) per common diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were positively impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset (\"DTA\") valuation allowance which provided a tax benefit during the year in the amount of $38.2 million and a $1.8 million gain on extinguishment of debt, representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration issued in the settlement transaction and the carrying value of the amounts due in connection with the settlement of obligations. 2014 results were impacted by a $3.9 million loss attributed to a bulk asset sale.\nNet Interest Income/ Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for the funding sources used to finance these assets. Changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and rates earned and paid, respectively, on those assets and liabilities. The net yield on total interest-earning assets, also referred to as net interest margin, represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin measures how efficiently the Company uses its earning assets and underlying capital. The Company's long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital risks. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax-exempt securities and loans.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNet interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $2.2 million from $24.2 million earned during the full year 2014 to $26.4 million for the full year 2015. This was the result of an increase in interest income, as well as, a decrease in interest expense.\nTax equivalent interest income rose $1.1 million as compared to 2014. A $47.2 million increase in interest-earning assets improved interest income by $1.7 million with the increases in both the securities and loan portfolios. A nine basis point decline in the average yield on interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $0.6 million as securities, with lower yields than loans, made up a larger proportion of interest-earning assets during 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest expense declined $1.0 million as compared to 2014. A $19.2 million decrease in interest-bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by an immaterial amount. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was largely concentrated in high cost time deposits. A fourteen basis point decline in total funding costs reduced interest expense by $1.0 million as high cost time deposits matured and were replaced with non-maturing deposits.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe net interest margin increased seven basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.33% during the same period in 2014. The Company's margin improved as it grew new loans, reduced nonaccruing loans in the portfolio, reduced high cost time deposits and paid-off debt obligations.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nNet interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $0.1 million from $24.1 million earned during the full year 2013 to $24.2 million for the full year 2014. This was the result of a decrease in interest expense more than offsetting a decrease in interest income.\nTax-equivalent interest income declined $0.6 million as compared to 2013 based on a decrease of $21.5 million in interest-earning assets reducing interest income by $0.8 million. The decrease in interest-earning assets was largely due to a reduction in securities. A three basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets improved interest income by $0.2 million as nonaccrual loans were replaced with new loans and lower yielding securities were sold and replaced with higher yielding instruments.\nInterest expense declined $0.8 million as compared to 2013 based on a $33.1 million decrease in interest-bearing liabilities reducing interest expense by $0.2 million. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was largely due to strategic initiatives to reduce high cost time deposits and FHLB advances with proceeds from successful troubled loan workouts and the bulk asset sale. A nine basis point decline in total funding costs reduced interest expense by $0.6 million as the pricing on deposits were lowered and maturing time deposits either repriced at significantly lower rates or were not retained.\nThe net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.33% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3.21% during the same period in 2013. Positively impacting the margin was a reduction in the Company's cost of interest-bearing liabilities due to maturity of higher rate time deposits and the decline in market interest rates. Negatively impacting the margin was the cost of retaining surplus liquidity, average loan volume decline and the impact of nonaccrual loan interest reversals.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II:

Losses\nThe amount of the provision for loan losses is based on management's evaluations of the loan portfolio, with particular attention directed toward nonperforming, impaired and other potential problem loans. During these evaluations, consideration is also given to such factors as management's evaluation of specific loans, the level and composition of impaired loans, other nonperforming loans, other identified potential problem loans, historical loss experience, results of examinations by regulatory agencies, results of the independent asset quality review process, the market value of collateral, the estimate of discounted cash flows, the strength and availability of guarantees, concentrations of credits and various other factors, including concentration of credit risk in various industries and current economic conditions.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nThe Company recorded $0.4 million of provision for loan losses during 2015 in comparison to $7.2 million recorded in the same period in 2014. The reduced need for provision charge during the period was driven by the following factors:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>No material migrations of performing loans to nonperforming status from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Charge-offs during the period were offset by recoveries, resulting in net recoveries for the year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Provision level in 2014 was impacted by a bulk asset sale;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued stabilization of collateral values.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Management continues to update collateral values and evaluate the level of specific allocations for impaired loans. As impaired loans have moved through the liquidation process, many of the previously established specific allocations have been charged off.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\n2014 compared to 2013.\nThe 2014 provision for loan losses charged to operating expense totaled $7.2 million, an increase of $3.8 million in comparison to $3.4 million recorded in the 2013 period. The largest part of the increase was related to the bulk asset sale that was completed in late 2014 and increased the provision charge by $2.9 million. Additionally the provision level for 2014 was driven by more aggressive workout strategies as the Company made a significant improvement to asset quality during the year.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income consists of a wide variety of fee-based revenues, including bank-related service charges on deposits, mortgage revenues and increases in cash surrender value on bank-owned life insurance.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest income totaled $12.4 million for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $12.8 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding gains related to the sale of OREO, securities and other non-recurring gains, noninterest income decreased by $0.6 million or 5.9%. The decline from 2014 can be attributed to a decrease in mortgage banking income along with a decline in service charge income.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nTotal noninterest income was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2013. This represented a decrease of $3.9 million in 2014 over the prior period. Included in 2014 and 2013 noninterest income results were securities gains, gains related to the sale of OREO and other gains. Excluding these items from both periods, recurring noninterest income declined $0.7 million or 6.4% in 2014 versus 2013 levels. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease related to reduced mortgage banking income due to lower production.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense is comprised primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expense.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $33.2 million which was $1.0 million lower than the year ended December 31, 2014. When excluding the OREO valuation adjustments and other non-recurring items, noninterest expense was $0.4 million, or 1.3%, above the comparable amount for 2014 driven by an increase in salaries and partially offset by a reduction in FDIC premium expense.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nNoninterest expense totaled $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $33.5 million for the same period in 2013. This represented an increase of $0.7 million or 2.1% in 2014 from 2013. Included in 2014 and 2013 noninterest expense results were OREO valuation adjustments. Excluding OREO valuations noninterest expense was flat in 2014 compared to 2013. Multiple categories saw expense improvement including: salary & benefits, marketing, loan processing and OREO carrying costs. These savings were offset by increasing occupancy, equipment and data processing costs.\nApplicable Income Taxes\nIn accordance with current income tax accounting guidance, the Company assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets (DTAs) based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard. The most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to (1) net operating loss carryforwards and (2) the allowance for loan losses.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of DTAs were evaluated. The ultimate realization of DTAs is based on the Company's ability to carryback net operating losses to prior tax periods, tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible, and the reversal of deductible temporary differences that can be offset by taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.\nIn 2010, the Company established a valuation allowance of $31.5 million against its DTAs because it concluded that, based upon the weight of all available evidence, it was more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. The valuation allowance increased to $39.8 million at December 31, 2014 due mainly to increases in the net operating loss carryforwards each year from 2010 through 2014. The valuation allowance decreased to $38.2 million before being reversed to zero at December 31, 2015 due to taxable income generated in 2015 which reduced the net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, management determined that is it more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax asset will be realized. This conclusion was based on\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nan analysis of both positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence included our return to profitability and positive three year cumulative pre-tax earnings as of December 31, 2015, significant improvement in asset quality and credit ratios, positive loan growth throughout 2015, future taxable income based on robust forecasting models including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies if needed, and the termination of the Company's Written Agreement by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. Negative evidence included a pre-tax loss in 2014, no available taxes paid in open carryback years, and the fact that the banking industry is highly competitive and heavily regulated. Management determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative and therefore the Company released the $38.2 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset on December 31, 2015 resulting in an income tax benefit.\nDuring 2014, the Company recorded no income tax expense or benefit, despite a loss of $4.5 million before income taxes. A current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre-tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance. After evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence, the Company determined a full valuation allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2014.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Management\nThe business of the Company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) which are funded for the most part by interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). All of the financial instruments of the Company are held for investment rather than trading purposes. Such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity of economic value to changes in market rates of interest, but also sensitivity in coupon income for adjustable rate instruments and reinvestment income of maturing instruments. The operating income and net income of the Bank depends, to a substantial extent, on rate differentials,\u201d i.e., the differences between the income the Bank receives from loans, securities, and other earning assets and the interest expense they pay to obtain deposits and other funding sources. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Bank, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nThe Company measures its overall interest rate sensitivity through a multiple scenario analysis. The primary analysis measures the change in net interest income resulting from instantaneous hypothetical changes in interest rates. This analysis assesses the risk of changes in net interest income in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 300 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates. Due to the current rate environment, this analysis was done in 2015 using a 100 basis point decrease in rates versus the normal 100 to 300 basis point decreases. Computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including parallel shifts of market interest rates, loan and security prepayments, and deposit run-off rates and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Actual values may differ from those projections set forth above, should market conditions vary from the assumptions used in preparing the analysis. Further, the computations do not contemplate actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The interest rates scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements.\nThe tables below present the Company's projected changes in net interest income for December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for the various rate shock levels.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in Net Interest Income Over One Year Horizon\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 300 bp\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 200 bp\n</td> <td>1,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 100 bp\n</td> <td>649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> - 100 bp\n</td> <td>(1,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,091\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs shown above, the effect of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2015 would increase the Company's net interest income by $1.3 million or 4.4%. The effect of an immediate 100 basis point decrease in rates would decrease the Company's net interest income by $1.5 million or 5.4%.\nDuring 2015, management continued to position the balance sheet to generate a benefit to income in a rising interest rate environment. This was accomplished by allowing the fixed rate securities to run off and replacing them with adjustable rate\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nsecurities. The loan portfolio had a lower amount of loans on which interest was not accruing at the end of the year, thus having a larger percentage of the total benefitting from rising interest rates. The primary factor increasing the benefit to the margin from rising interest rates was the greater percentage of funding coming from non-maturity deposits. These deposits tend to be less sensitive to rising interest rates as these are primarily transaction balances. This is somewhat related to the general industry trend of an influx of funds from money market mutual funds which will likely be less secure funding. This makes it necessary to invest these funds focusing on less volatile assets. With the influx of deposits into non-maturity accounts there was reduced dependence on time deposits and from wholesale funding. Time deposits and wholesale funding tend to have the highest sensitivity to rising interest rates and our reduced concentration of this type of funding allows greater benefit to the margin from rising interest rates.\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral\nFollowing are highlights of the December 31, 2015 balance sheet when compared to December 31, 2014:\nLoans. The Company offers a broad range of products, including commercial; agricultural production and agricultural real estate; construction, land and development; commercial real estate, 1-4 family mortgages; and consumer loans, designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company's loans are diversified by borrower and industry group.\nOutstanding loans totaled $633.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $553.2 million at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $80.3 million or 14.52%. This increase is primarily due to a combination of new organic loan growth and normal seasonal line draws offset by the classification of $11.5 million of loans included in branch assets held for sale due to our agreement to sell three branches. See Note 19. Subsequent Events for additional disclosure related to the branch sales.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, commitments of the Bank under standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit totaled approximately $151.8 million and $115.3 million.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>STATED LOAN MATURITIES (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural & AGRE\n</td> <td>20,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction, land & development\n</td> <td>8,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commerical RE\n</td> <td>39,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 mortgages\n</td> <td>14,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>633,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Maturities based upon contractual maturity dates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maturities presented above are based upon contractual maturities.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans. If a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the loan does not generate current period income for the Company and any amounts received are generally applied first to principal and then to interest. It is the policy of the Company not to renegotiate the terms of a loan because of a delinquent status. Rather, a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond 90 days.\nThe classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible, in whole or in part. The Bank makes a determination as to collectability on a case-by-case basis and considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans. The final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation. Alternatives that are typically considered to collect nonaccrual loans are foreclosure, collection under guarantees, loan restructuring, or judicial collection actions.\nOther nonperforming assets consist of real estate acquired through loan foreclosures or other workout situations and other assets acquired through repossessions.\nEach of the Company's commercial loans is assigned a risk rating at origination based upon an internally developed grading system. A separate credit administration department also reviews selected grade assignments on a quarterly basis. Management continuously monitors nonperforming, impaired, and past due loans in an effort to prevent further deterioration of these loans. The Company has an independent loan review function which is separate from the lending function and is responsible for the review of new and existing loans.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of nonperforming assets:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans (including TDRs)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDRs still accruing interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>8,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans to total end of period loans\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total end of period loans\n</td> <td>2.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total end of period assets\n</td> <td>1.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's level of nonperforming assets has declined significantly over the past two years mainly due to the sale of $35.2 million of troubled assets through the bulk asset sale completed on December 5, 2014 which included the sale of $9.5 million in nonaccrual loans and $7.7 million in OREO. Total nonperforming assets declined $3.6 million to $14.4 million, or 1.50% of total assets, at December 31, 2015 from $18.0 million at December 31, 2014. Total nonperforming assets included $0.2 million in troubled debt restructures, $8.4 million of foreclosed assets and repossessed real estate, and $5.8 million of nonaccrual loans compared to $10.3 million of foreclosed assets and $7.7 million of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014. Approximately 2.11% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015 were concentrated in land development, construction and commercial real estate credits. Additionally $3.6 million or 60.28% of total nonaccrual loans represented a multi-family loan to one borrower.\nNonperforming Loans\nNonperforming loans (nonaccrual, 90 days past due and troubled debt restructures) decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, largely due to successful workout asset sale strategies.\nThe level of nonperforming loans to end of period loans was 0.93% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to 1.40% as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the decrease in the nonperforming loans, the allowance to nonperforming loan coverage ratio increased to 143.02% for year ended December 31, 2015 from 102.99% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nOther Real Estate Owned\nForeclosure of impaired loans has resulted in elevated levels of other real estate owned (OREO) as foreclosed properties have been especially difficult to move in the current economic environment. OREO was $8.4 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $10.3 million as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, the Company transferred $0.3 million of foreclosed or repossessed real estate from the loan portfolio. OREO properties with a carrying value of $5.2 million were written down to their fair value of $4.9 million, resulting in a charge to earnings of $0.3 million. This compares to 2014 when OREO properties with a carrying value of $6.0 million were written down to their fair value of $4.5 million, which resulted in a charge to earnings of $1.5 million during the year.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of other real estate owned at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Book\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Book\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developed property\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant land or unsold lots\n</td> <td>3,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other real estate owned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Potential Problem Loans\nThe Company has other potential problem loans that are currently performing, but where some concerns exist regarding the nature of the borrowers' projects in our current economic environment. As of December 31, 2015, management identified $0.1 million of loans that are currently performing but due to the economic environment facing these borrowers were classified by management as impaired. Impaired loans that are performing account for 1.44% of the loans deemed impaired during 2015. Excluding nonperforming loans and loans that management has classified as impaired, there are other potential problem loans that totaled $5.3 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $8.5 million at December 31, 2014. The classification of these loans, however, does not imply that management expects losses on each of these loans, but believes that a higher level of scrutiny and closer monitoring is prudent under the circumstances. Such classifications relate to specific concerns for each individual borrower and do not relate to any concentration risk common to all loans in this group.\nThe Company proactively reviews loans for potential impairment regardless of the payment or performance status. This approach results in some relationships being classified as impaired but still performing.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $8.6 million, or 1.33% of total loans, as compared to $8.0 million, or 1.44% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. The Company recorded $0.4 million of provision to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 largely due to net loan growth.\nActivity in the Allowance for years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Net Charge-offs)/ recoveries\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring December 2014, the Company entered into a bulk loan sale where $18.0 million of classified loans were sold, at a discount of approximately 24% of their carrying value. This bulk loan sale reduced the level of classified loans by 56.7%. The Allowance for these loans individually evaluated for impairment at the time of sale totaled $3.7 million.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe components of the Allowance for Loan Losses ( Allowance\u201d) at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans individually evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans collectively evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>6,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe general component of the Allowance covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component also includes loans that are not individually identified for impairment evaluation, as well as those loans that are individually evaluated but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for factors. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; migration of loans to the classification of special mention, substandard or doubtful; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentration.\nThe establishment of the Allowance involves a high degree of judgment and includes a level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all of the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses occur.\nNet loan charge-offs for 2015 resulted in a net recovery of $0.2 million, or (0.04)% of average loans, compared with a net charge-off of $10.9 million, or 1.90% of average loans, in the same period of 2014. Management believes losses are being recognized in our portfolio through charge-offs as they are confirmed.\nOf the $8.6 million allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015, $5.7 million, or 66.28%, was allocated to commercial real estate loans. Management monitors these collateral dependent real estate loans periodically to analyze the adequacy of the cash flows to support the debt levels and obtains updated appraisals to determine the collateral's fair value for impairment analysis.\nManagement continues to diligently monitor the loan portfolio, paying particular attention to borrowers with land development, residential and commercial real estate, and commercial development exposures. Should the economic climate deteriorate from current levels, more borrowers may experience repayment difficulty, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, potentially requiring increases in the provision for loan losses. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents a ratio analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS RATIOS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loan charge-offs to total average loans\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses to average loans\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to total end of period loans\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>143.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities. The primary strategic objective of the Company's $171.4 million securities - available-for-sale from December 31, 2015, which excludes restricted securities, is to minimize interest rate risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and maximize return. In managing the securities portfolio, the Company minimizes any credit risk and avoids investments in sophisticated and complex investment products. The portfolio includes several callable agency debentures, adjustable rate mortgage pass-throughs, municipal bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations. Collateralized mortgage obligations currently owned are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Neither the Company nor the Bank hold any securities containing sub-prime mortgages or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac equities. The Company does not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nThe Company's financial planning anticipates income streams generated by the securities portfolio based on normal maturity and reinvestment. Securities classified as available-for-sale, carried at fair value, were $171.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nto $135.4 million at December 31, 2014. The Company also holds Federal Reserve Board and Federal Home Loan Bank stock which are classified as restricted securities of $9.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nDeposits. Deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificate accounts (including jumbo\u201d certificates in denominations of $100,000 or more), and retirement savings plans. The Company's average balance of total deposits was $707.0 million for 2015, representing a decrease of $37.7 million or 5.06% compared with the average balance of total deposits for 2014 of $744.7 million as higher cost time deposits matured and were not renewed.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the Bank's average deposits:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Paid\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand deposit accounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td>150,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market accounts\n</td> <td>118,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings accounts\n</td> <td>123,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time, less than $100,000\n</td> <td>123,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time, $100,000 or more\n</td> <td>72,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>706,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, average time deposits over $100,000 represented 10.22% of total average deposits, compared with 12.53% of total average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2014.

In addition to the normal inflow of funds from core-deposit growth together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments, the Company utilizes other short-term funding sources such as brokered time deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, overnight federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short-term deposits from public entities, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nThe Company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases, which vary depending upon the time period. As the time period is expanded, other data is factored in, including estimated loan funding requirements, estimated loan payoffs, investment portfolio maturities or calls, and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs.\nThe Company classifies all of its securities as available-for-sale, thereby maintaining significant liquidity. The Company's liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the Company's loan portfolio, resulting in a steady stream of loan repayments. In managing its investment portfolio, the Company provides for staggered maturities so that cash flows are provided as such investments mature.\nThe Company's cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities offset by cash flows used in operating activities and investing activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2015, the Company experienced a positive net cash flow of $108.0 million in financing activities primarily due to the net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock as part of the March 31, 2015 recapitalization. In contrast, net cash outflows of $136.0 million were used by investing activities due to the purchase of available for sale securities and an overall increase in net loans. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million.\nThe Bank's securities portfolio, federal funds sold, and cash and due from bank deposit balances serve as the primary sources of liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2015, 13.47% of the Bank's interest-bearing deposits were in the form of time deposits of $100,000 and over. Management believes these deposits to be a stable source of funds. However, if a large number of these time deposits matured at approximately the same time and were not renewed, the Bank's liquidity could be adversely affected. Currently, the maturities of the large time deposits are spread throughout the year, with 19.73% maturing in the first quarter of 2016, 14.59% maturing in the second quarter of 2016, 31.89% maturing in the third and fourth quarter of 2016, and the remaining 33.79% maturing thereafter. The Bank monitors those maturities in an effort to minimize any adverse effect on liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2015, borrowings included $10.0 million each for Centrue Statutory Trust II and Centrue Statutory Trust III. The principal source of debt service payments for these obligations is from the net proceeds of the Company's recent capital financing. Borrowings held at the Bank include $76.0 million in FHLB advances and $18.7 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase; the debt service for the Bank's borrowings is provided by operating cash flows from the Bank.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet financial instruments. The following tables summarize the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commitments and off balance sheet instruments as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series B mandatory redeemable preferred stock\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances\n</td> <td>60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nCommitments, Contingencies, and Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nSome financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $149.8 million in outstanding loan commitments including outstanding commitments for various lines of credit and $2.0 million of standby letters of credit. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' Equity\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $121.3 million, an increase of $91.0 million from $30.3 million at December 31, 2014. The change in stockholders' equity during 2015 was largely the result of a recapitalization through the issuance of 6.3 million shares of Centrue common stock with aggregate gross proceeds of $76.0 million and net proceeds of $69.0 million after issuance costs. Average equity as a percentage of average assets was 7.94% at December 31, 2015 compared to 4.19% at December 31, 2014. Book value per common share equaled $18.21 at December 31, 2015, an increase from $(32.93) reported at the end of 2014.\nCapital Measurements\nThe Company and the Bank ( Regulated Companies\u201d) are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by these regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Regulated Companies must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Their capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Regulated Companies to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and of Tier 1 Capital to average assets. Tier 1 Capital includes common stockholders' equity, qualifying preferred stock and Trust Preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other deductions (including the unrealized net gains and losses, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale securities carried at fair value). CET1 is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not CET1.Total Capital includes Tier 1 Capital plus preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, mandatory convertible debt, subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations by the guidelines.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved rules that implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nBasel III also introduced changes to risk-weightings and treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). In 2015, the Bank made a one-time available election to opt-out of the impact of certain unrealized capital gains and losses in AOCI being included in regulatory capital. There is no opportunity to change methodology in future periods.\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company completed a common stock offering and capital infusion into the Bank.

The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve-Chicago.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning recent accounting developments.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to address the significant factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. When we use the terms Centrue,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d we mean Centrue Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank,\u201d we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank.\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. All financial information in the following tables is displayed in thousands (000s), except per share data.\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by the use of words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" planned\u201d or potential\u201d or similar expressions.\nThe Company's ability to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company and the subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in: interest rates; general economic conditions; legislative/regulatory changes; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; the quality and composition of the loan or securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the Company's market areas; the Company's implementation of new technologies; the Company's ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of Centrue's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nCentrue's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies are deemed critical:\nSecurities: Securities are classified as available-for-sale when Centrue may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in yields on alternative investments, and for other reasons. They are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. All of Centrue's securities are classified as available-for-sale. For all securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. Due to the limited nature of the market for certain securities, the fair value and potential sale proceeds could be materially different in the event of a sale.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in securities gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\ntheir amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether the loss is temporary or other-than-temporary. If the Company (a) has the intent to sell a debt security or (b) is more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire unrealized loss in earnings as an other-than-temporary loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and (b) the amount of total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company also evaluates whether the decline in fair value of an equity security is temporary or other-than-temporary. In determining whether an unrealized loss on an equity security is temporary or other-than-temporary, management considers various factors including the magnitude and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security to forecasted recovery.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on an estimation computed pursuant to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance and rules stating that the analysis of the allowance for loan losses consists of three components:\n \u2022 Specific Component. The specific credit allocation component is based on an analysis of individual impaired loans over a fixed-dollar amount where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the market price of the loan, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost of sale. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values; \n \u2022 Historical Loss Component. The historical loss component is mathematically based using a modified loss migration analysis that examines historical loan loss experience for each loan category. The loss migration is performed quarterly and loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience. The general portfolio allocation element of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of the amounts necessary for concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume. The methodology utilized by management to calculate the historical loss portion of the allowance adequacy analysis is based on historical losses. This historical loss period is based on a weighted twelve-quarter average (3 years); and \n \u2022 Qualitative Component. The qualitative component requires qualitative judgment and estimates reserves based on general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors believed to be relevant to the markets in which the Company operates. The process for determining the allowance (which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses) includes subjective elements and, therefore, may be susceptible to significant change.  To the extent actual outcomes differs from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the Company's earnings or financial position in future periods.\nOther Real Estate Owned: Other real estate owned includes properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans. Properties are recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of other real estate owned. Any write-downs of the properties subsequent to acquisition, as well as gains or losses on disposition and income or expense from the operations of other real estate owned, are recognized in operating results in the period they are realized.\nIncome Taxes: We determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences result in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nWe assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management makes judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nManagement also makes certain interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of the tax position may not be certain. Uncertain tax positions are periodically evaluated and we may establish tax reserves for benefits that may not be realized. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 11 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nCentrue Financial Corporation is a bank holding company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company provides a full range of products and services to individual and corporate customers extending from the far western and southern suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area across Central Illinois down to the metropolitan St. Louis area. These products and services include demand, time, and savings deposits; lending; mortgage banking, brokerage, asset management, and trust services. Brokerage, asset management, and trust services are provided to our customers on a referral basis to third party providers. The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions, including banks, thrifts and credit unions, as well as nonfinancial institutions providing financial services. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiary, Centrue Bank, are subject to regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income (Loss)\n2015 compared to 2014. Net income equaled $42.6 million or $11.08 per common diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a net loss of $4.5 million or $(44.81) per common diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were positively impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset (\"DTA\") valuation allowance which provided a tax benefit during the year in the amount of $38.2 million and a $1.8 million gain on extinguishment of debt, representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration issued in the settlement transaction and the carrying value of the amounts due in connection with the settlement of obligations. 2014 results were impacted by a $3.9 million loss attributed to a bulk asset sale.\nNet Interest Income/ Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for the funding sources used to finance these assets. Changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and rates earned and paid, respectively, on those assets and liabilities. The net yield on total interest-earning assets, also referred to as net interest margin, represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin measures how efficiently the Company uses its earning assets and underlying capital. The Company's long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital risks. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax-exempt securities and loans.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNet interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $2.2 million from $24.2 million earned during the full year 2014 to $26.4 million for the full year 2015. This was the result of an increase in interest income, as well as, a decrease in interest expense.\nTax equivalent interest income rose $1.1 million as compared to 2014. A $47.2 million increase in interest-earning assets improved interest income by $1.7 million with the increases in both the securities and loan portfolios. A nine basis point decline in the average yield on interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $0.6 million as securities, with lower yields than loans, made up a larger proportion of interest-earning assets during 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest expense declined $1.0 million as compared to 2014. A $19.2 million decrease in interest-bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by an immaterial amount. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was largely concentrated in high cost time deposits. A fourteen basis point decline in total funding costs reduced interest expense by $1.0 million as high cost time deposits matured and were replaced with non-maturing deposits.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe net interest margin increased seven basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.33% during the same period in 2014. The Company's margin improved as it grew new loans, reduced nonaccruing loans in the portfolio, reduced high cost time deposits and paid-off debt obligations.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nNet interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $0.1 million from $24.1 million earned during the full year 2013 to $24.2 million for the full year 2014. This was the result of a decrease in interest expense more than offsetting a decrease in interest income.\nTax-equivalent interest income declined $0.6 million as compared to 2013 based on a decrease of $21.5 million in interest-earning assets reducing interest income by $0.8 million. The decrease in interest-earning assets was largely due to a reduction in securities. A three basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets improved interest income by $0.2 million as nonaccrual loans were replaced with new loans and lower yielding securities were sold and replaced with higher yielding instruments.\nInterest expense declined $0.8 million as compared to 2013 based on a $33.1 million decrease in interest-bearing liabilities reducing interest expense by $0.2 million. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was largely due to strategic initiatives to reduce high cost time deposits and FHLB advances with proceeds from successful troubled loan workouts and the bulk asset sale. A nine basis point decline in total funding costs reduced interest expense by $0.6 million as the pricing on deposits were lowered and maturing time deposits either repriced at significantly lower rates or were not retained.\nThe net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.33% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3.21% during the same period in 2013. Positively impacting the margin was a reduction in the Company's cost of interest-bearing liabilities due to maturity of higher rate time deposits and the decline in market interest rates. Negatively impacting the margin was the cost of retaining surplus liquidity, average loan volume decline and the impact of nonaccrual loan interest reversals.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II:

Losses\nThe amount of the provision for loan losses is based on management's evaluations of the loan portfolio, with particular attention directed toward nonperforming, impaired and other potential problem loans. During these evaluations, consideration is also given to such factors as management's evaluation of specific loans, the level and composition of impaired loans, other nonperforming loans, other identified potential problem loans, historical loss experience, results of examinations by regulatory agencies, results of the independent asset quality review process, the market value of collateral, the estimate of discounted cash flows, the strength and availability of guarantees, concentrations of credits and various other factors, including concentration of credit risk in various industries and current economic conditions.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nThe Company recorded $0.4 million of provision for loan losses during 2015 in comparison to $7.2 million recorded in the same period in 2014. The reduced need for provision charge during the period was driven by the following factors:\n \u2022 No material migrations of performing loans to nonperforming status from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015; \n \u2022 Charge-offs during the period were offset by recoveries, resulting in net recoveries for the year; \n \u2022 Provision level in 2014 was impacted by a bulk asset sale; \n \u2022 Continued stabilization of collateral values.  Management continues to update collateral values and evaluate the level of specific allocations for impaired loans. As impaired loans have moved through the liquidation process, many of the previously established specific allocations have been charged off.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\n2014 compared to 2013.\nThe 2014 provision for loan losses charged to operating expense totaled $7.2 million, an increase of $3.8 million in comparison to $3.4 million recorded in the 2013 period. The largest part of the increase was related to the bulk asset sale that was completed in late 2014 and increased the provision charge by $2.9 million. Additionally the provision level for 2014 was driven by more aggressive workout strategies as the Company made a significant improvement to asset quality during the year.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income consists of a wide variety of fee-based revenues, including bank-related service charges on deposits, mortgage revenues and increases in cash surrender value on bank-owned life insurance.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest income totaled $12.4 million for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $12.8 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding gains related to the sale of OREO, securities and other non-recurring gains, noninterest income decreased by $0.6 million or 5.9%. The decline from 2014 can be attributed to a decrease in mortgage banking income along with a decline in service charge income.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nTotal noninterest income was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2013. This represented a decrease of $3.9 million in 2014 over the prior period. Included in 2014 and 2013 noninterest income results were securities gains, gains related to the sale of OREO and other gains. Excluding these items from both periods, recurring noninterest income declined $0.7 million or 6.4% in 2014 versus 2013 levels. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease related to reduced mortgage banking income due to lower production.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense is comprised primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expense.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $33.2 million which was $1.0 million lower than the year ended December 31, 2014. When excluding the OREO valuation adjustments and other non-recurring items, noninterest expense was $0.4 million, or 1.3%, above the comparable amount for 2014 driven by an increase in salaries and partially offset by a reduction in FDIC premium expense.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nNoninterest expense totaled $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $33.5 million for the same period in 2013. This represented an increase of $0.7 million or 2.1% in 2014 from 2013. Included in 2014 and 2013 noninterest expense results were OREO valuation adjustments. Excluding OREO valuations noninterest expense was flat in 2014 compared to 2013. Multiple categories saw expense improvement including: salary & benefits, marketing, loan processing and OREO carrying costs. These savings were offset by increasing occupancy, equipment and data processing costs.\nApplicable Income Taxes\nIn accordance with current income tax accounting guidance, the Company assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets (DTAs) based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard. The most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to (1) net operating loss carryforwards and (2) the allowance for loan losses.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of DTAs were evaluated. The ultimate realization of DTAs is based on the Company's ability to carryback net operating losses to prior tax periods, tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible, and the reversal of deductible temporary differences that can be offset by taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.\nIn 2010, the Company established a valuation allowance of $31.5 million against its DTAs because it concluded that, based upon the weight of all available evidence, it was more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. The valuation allowance increased to $39.8 million at December 31, 2014 due mainly to increases in the net operating loss carryforwards each year from 2010 through 2014. The valuation allowance decreased to $38.2 million before being reversed to zero at December 31, 2015 due to taxable income generated in 2015 which reduced the net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, management determined that is it more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax asset will be realized. This conclusion was based on\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nan analysis of both positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence included our return to profitability and positive three year cumulative pre-tax earnings as of December 31, 2015, significant improvement in asset quality and credit ratios, positive loan growth throughout 2015, future taxable income based on robust forecasting models including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies if needed, and the termination of the Company's Written Agreement by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. Negative evidence included a pre-tax loss in 2014, no available taxes paid in open carryback years, and the fact that the banking industry is highly competitive and heavily regulated. Management determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative and therefore the Company released the $38.2 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset on December 31, 2015 resulting in an income tax benefit.\nDuring 2014, the Company recorded no income tax expense or benefit, despite a loss of $4.5 million before income taxes. A current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre-tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance. After evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence, the Company determined a full valuation allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2014.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Management\nThe business of the Company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) which are funded for the most part by interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). All of the financial instruments of the Company are held for investment rather than trading purposes. Such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity of economic value to changes in market rates of interest, but also sensitivity in coupon income for adjustable rate instruments and reinvestment income of maturing instruments. The operating income and net income of the Bank depends, to a substantial extent, on rate differentials,\u201d i.e., the differences between the income the Bank receives from loans, securities, and other earning assets and the interest expense they pay to obtain deposits and other funding sources. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Bank, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nThe Company measures its overall interest rate sensitivity through a multiple scenario analysis. The primary analysis measures the change in net interest income resulting from instantaneous hypothetical changes in interest rates. This analysis assesses the risk of changes in net interest income in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 300 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates. Due to the current rate environment, this analysis was done in 2015 using a 100 basis point decrease in rates versus the normal 100 to 300 basis point decreases. Computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including parallel shifts of market interest rates, loan and security prepayments, and deposit run-off rates and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Actual values may differ from those projections set forth above, should market conditions vary from the assumptions used in preparing the analysis. Further, the computations do not contemplate actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The interest rates scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements.\nThe tables below present the Company's projected changes in net interest income for December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for the various rate shock levels.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in Net Interest Income Over One Year Horizon\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 300 bp\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 200 bp\n</td> <td>1,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 100 bp\n</td> <td>649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> - 100 bp\n</td> <td>(1,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,091\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs shown above, the effect of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2015 would increase the Company's net interest income by $1.3 million or 4.4%. The effect of an immediate 100 basis point decrease in rates would decrease the Company's net interest income by $1.5 million or 5.4%.\nDuring 2015, management continued to position the balance sheet to generate a benefit to income in a rising interest rate environment. This was accomplished by allowing the fixed rate securities to run off and replacing them with adjustable rate\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nsecurities. The loan portfolio had a lower amount of loans on which interest was not accruing at the end of the year, thus having a larger percentage of the total benefitting from rising interest rates. The primary factor increasing the benefit to the margin from rising interest rates was the greater percentage of funding coming from non-maturity deposits. These deposits tend to be less sensitive to rising interest rates as these are primarily transaction balances. This is somewhat related to the general industry trend of an influx of funds from money market mutual funds which will likely be less secure funding. This makes it necessary to invest these funds focusing on less volatile assets. With the influx of deposits into non-maturity accounts there was reduced dependence on time deposits and from wholesale funding. Time deposits and wholesale funding tend to have the highest sensitivity to rising interest rates and our reduced concentration of this type of funding allows greater benefit to the margin from rising interest rates.\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral\nFollowing are highlights of the December 31, 2015 balance sheet when compared to December 31, 2014:\nLoans. The Company offers a broad range of products, including commercial; agricultural production and agricultural real estate; construction, land and development; commercial real estate, 1-4 family mortgages; and consumer loans, designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company's loans are diversified by borrower and industry group.\nOutstanding loans totaled $633.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $553.2 million at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $80.3 million or 14.52%. This increase is primarily due to a combination of new organic loan growth and normal seasonal line draws offset by the classification of $11.5 million of loans included in branch assets held for sale due to our agreement to sell three branches. See Note 19. Subsequent Events for additional disclosure related to the branch sales.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, commitments of the Bank under standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit totaled approximately $151.8 million and $115.3 million.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>STATED LOAN MATURITIES (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural & AGRE\n</td> <td>20,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction, land & development\n</td> <td>8,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commerical RE\n</td> <td>39,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 mortgages\n</td> <td>14,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>633,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Maturities based upon contractual maturity dates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maturities presented above are based upon contractual maturities.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans. If a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the loan does not generate current period income for the Company and any amounts received are generally applied first to principal and then to interest. It is the policy of the Company not to renegotiate the terms of a loan because of a delinquent status. Rather, a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond 90 days.\nThe classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible, in whole or in part. The Bank makes a determination as to collectability on a case-by-case basis and considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans. The final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation. Alternatives that are typically considered to collect nonaccrual loans are foreclosure, collection under guarantees, loan restructuring, or judicial collection actions.\nOther nonperforming assets consist of real estate acquired through loan foreclosures or other workout situations and other assets acquired through repossessions.\nEach of the Company's commercial loans is assigned a risk rating at origination based upon an internally developed grading system. A separate credit administration department also reviews selected grade assignments on a quarterly basis. Management continuously monitors nonperforming, impaired, and past due loans in an effort to prevent further deterioration of these loans. The Company has an independent loan review function which is separate from the lending function and is responsible for the review of new and existing loans.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of nonperforming assets:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans (including TDRs)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDRs still accruing interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>8,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans to total end of period loans\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total end of period loans\n</td> <td>2.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total end of period assets\n</td> <td>1.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's level of nonperforming assets has declined significantly over the past two years mainly due to the sale of $35.2 million of troubled assets through the bulk asset sale completed on December 5, 2014 which included the sale of $9.5 million in nonaccrual loans and $7.7 million in OREO. Total nonperforming assets declined $3.6 million to $14.4 million, or 1.50% of total assets, at December 31, 2015 from $18.0 million at December 31, 2014. Total nonperforming assets included $0.2 million in troubled debt restructures, $8.4 million of foreclosed assets and repossessed real estate, and $5.8 million of nonaccrual loans compared to $10.3 million of foreclosed assets and $7.7 million of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014. Approximately 2.11% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015 were concentrated in land development, construction and commercial real estate credits. Additionally $3.6 million or 60.28% of total nonaccrual loans represented a multi-family loan to one borrower.\nNonperforming Loans\nNonperforming loans (nonaccrual, 90 days past due and troubled debt restructures) decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, largely due to successful workout asset sale strategies.\nThe level of nonperforming loans to end of period loans was 0.93% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to 1.40% as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the decrease in the nonperforming loans, the allowance to nonperforming loan coverage ratio increased to 143.02% for year ended December 31, 2015 from 102.99% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nOther Real Estate Owned\nForeclosure of impaired loans has resulted in elevated levels of other real estate owned (OREO) as foreclosed properties have been especially difficult to move in the current economic environment. OREO was $8.4 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $10.3 million as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, the Company transferred $0.3 million of foreclosed or repossessed real estate from the loan portfolio. OREO properties with a carrying value of $5.2 million were written down to their fair value of $4.9 million, resulting in a charge to earnings of $0.3 million. This compares to 2014 when OREO properties with a carrying value of $6.0 million were written down to their fair value of $4.5 million, which resulted in a charge to earnings of $1.5 million during the year.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of other real estate owned at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Book\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Book\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developed property\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant land or unsold lots\n</td> <td>3,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other real estate owned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Potential Problem Loans\nThe Company has other potential problem loans that are currently performing, but where some concerns exist regarding the nature of the borrowers' projects in our current economic environment. As of December 31, 2015, management identified $0.1 million of loans that are currently performing but due to the economic environment facing these borrowers were classified by management as impaired. Impaired loans that are performing account for 1.44% of the loans deemed impaired during 2015. Excluding nonperforming loans and loans that management has classified as impaired, there are other potential problem loans that totaled $5.3 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $8.5 million at December 31, 2014. The classification of these loans, however, does not imply that management expects losses on each of these loans, but believes that a higher level of scrutiny and closer monitoring is prudent under the circumstances. Such classifications relate to specific concerns for each individual borrower and do not relate to any concentration risk common to all loans in this group.\nThe Company proactively reviews loans for potential impairment regardless of the payment or performance status. This approach results in some relationships being classified as impaired but still performing.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $8.6 million, or 1.33% of total loans, as compared to $8.0 million, or 1.44% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. The Company recorded $0.4 million of provision to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 largely due to net loan growth.\nActivity in the Allowance for years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Net Charge-offs)/ recoveries\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring December 2014, the Company entered into a bulk loan sale where $18.0 million of classified loans were sold, at a discount of approximately 24% of their carrying value. This bulk loan sale reduced the level of classified loans by 56.7%. The Allowance for these loans individually evaluated for impairment at the time of sale totaled $3.7 million.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe components of the Allowance for Loan Losses ( Allowance\u201d) at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans individually evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans collectively evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>6,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe general component of the Allowance covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component also includes loans that are not individually identified for impairment evaluation, as well as those loans that are individually evaluated but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for factors. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; migration of loans to the classification of special mention, substandard or doubtful; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentration.\nThe establishment of the Allowance involves a high degree of judgment and includes a level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all of the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses occur.\nNet loan charge-offs for 2015 resulted in a net recovery of $0.2 million, or (0.04)% of average loans, compared with a net charge-off of $10.9 million, or 1.90% of average loans, in the same period of 2014. Management believes losses are being recognized in our portfolio through charge-offs as they are confirmed.\nOf the $8.6 million allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015, $5.7 million, or 66.28%, was allocated to commercial real estate loans. Management monitors these collateral dependent real estate loans periodically to analyze the adequacy of the cash flows to support the debt levels and obtains updated appraisals to determine the collateral's fair value for impairment analysis.\nManagement continues to diligently monitor the loan portfolio, paying particular attention to borrowers with land development, residential and commercial real estate, and commercial development exposures. Should the economic climate deteriorate from current levels, more borrowers may experience repayment difficulty, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, potentially requiring increases in the provision for loan losses. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents a ratio analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS RATIOS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loan charge-offs to total average loans\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses to average loans\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to total end of period loans\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>143.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities. The primary strategic objective of the Company's $171.4 million securities - available-for-sale from December 31, 2015, which excludes restricted securities, is to minimize interest rate risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and maximize return. In managing the securities portfolio, the Company minimizes any credit risk and avoids investments in sophisticated and complex investment products. The portfolio includes several callable agency debentures, adjustable rate mortgage pass-throughs, municipal bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations. Collateralized mortgage obligations currently owned are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Neither the Company nor the Bank hold any securities containing sub-prime mortgages or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac equities. The Company does not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nThe Company's financial planning anticipates income streams generated by the securities portfolio based on normal maturity and reinvestment. Securities classified as available-for-sale, carried at fair value, were $171.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nto $135.4 million at December 31, 2014. The Company also holds Federal Reserve Board and Federal Home Loan Bank stock which are classified as restricted securities of $9.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nDeposits. Deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificate accounts (including jumbo\u201d certificates in denominations of $100,000 or more), and retirement savings plans. The Company's average balance of total deposits was $707.0 million for 2015, representing a decrease of $37.7 million or 5.06% compared with the average balance of total deposits for 2014 of $744.7 million as higher cost time deposits matured and were not renewed.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the Bank's average deposits:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Paid\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand deposit accounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td>150,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market accounts\n</td> <td>118,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings accounts\n</td> <td>123,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time, less than $100,000\n</td> <td>123,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time, $100,000 or more\n</td> <td>72,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>706,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, average time deposits over $100,000 represented 10.22% of total average deposits, compared with 12.53% of total average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2014.

In addition to the normal inflow of funds from core-deposit growth together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments, the Company utilizes other short-term funding sources such as brokered time deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, overnight federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short-term deposits from public entities, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nThe Company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases, which vary depending upon the time period. As the time period is expanded, other data is factored in, including estimated loan funding requirements, estimated loan payoffs, investment portfolio maturities or calls, and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs.\nThe Company classifies all of its securities as available-for-sale, thereby maintaining significant liquidity. The Company's liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the Company's loan portfolio, resulting in a steady stream of loan repayments. In managing its investment portfolio, the Company provides for staggered maturities so that cash flows are provided as such investments mature.\nThe Company's cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities offset by cash flows used in operating activities and investing activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2015, the Company experienced a positive net cash flow of $108.0 million in financing activities primarily due to the net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock as part of the March 31, 2015 recapitalization. In contrast, net cash outflows of $136.0 million were used by investing activities due to the purchase of available for sale securities and an overall increase in net loans. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million.\nThe Bank's securities portfolio, federal funds sold, and cash and due from bank deposit balances serve as the primary sources of liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2015, 13.47% of the Bank's interest-bearing deposits were in the form of time deposits of $100,000 and over. Management believes these deposits to be a stable source of funds. However, if a large number of these time deposits matured at approximately the same time and were not renewed, the Bank's liquidity could be adversely affected. Currently, the maturities of the large time deposits are spread throughout the year, with 19.73% maturing in the first quarter of 2016, 14.59% maturing in the second quarter of 2016, 31.89% maturing in the third and fourth quarter of 2016, and the remaining 33.79% maturing thereafter. The Bank monitors those maturities in an effort to minimize any adverse effect on liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2015, borrowings included $10.0 million each for Centrue Statutory Trust II and Centrue Statutory Trust III. The principal source of debt service payments for these obligations is from the net proceeds of the Company's recent capital financing. Borrowings held at the Bank include $76.0 million in FHLB advances and $18.7 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase; the debt service for the Bank's borrowings is provided by operating cash flows from the Bank.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet financial instruments. The following tables summarize the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commitments and off balance sheet instruments as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series B mandatory redeemable preferred stock\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances\n</td> <td>60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nCommitments, Contingencies, and Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nSome financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $149.8 million in outstanding loan commitments including outstanding commitments for various lines of credit and $2.0 million of standby letters of credit. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' Equity\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $121.3 million, an increase of $91.0 million from $30.3 million at December 31, 2014. The change in stockholders' equity during 2015 was largely the result of a recapitalization through the issuance of 6.3 million shares of Centrue common stock with aggregate gross proceeds of $76.0 million and net proceeds of $69.0 million after issuance costs. Average equity as a percentage of average assets was 7.94% at December 31, 2015 compared to 4.19% at December 31, 2014. Book value per common share equaled $18.21 at December 31, 2015, an increase from $(32.93) reported at the end of 2014.\nCapital Measurements\nThe Company and the Bank ( Regulated Companies\u201d) are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by these regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Regulated Companies must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Their capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Regulated Companies to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and of Tier 1 Capital to average assets. Tier 1 Capital includes common stockholders' equity, qualifying preferred stock and Trust Preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other deductions (including the unrealized net gains and losses, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale securities carried at fair value). CET1 is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not CET1.Total Capital includes Tier 1 Capital plus preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, mandatory convertible debt, subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations by the guidelines.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved rules that implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nBasel III also introduced changes to risk-weightings and treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). In 2015, the Bank made a one-time available election to opt-out of the impact of certain unrealized capital gains and losses in AOCI being included in regulatory capital. There is no opportunity to change methodology in future periods.\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company completed a common stock offering and capital infusion into the Bank. See Note 1 to the Audited Financial Statements for additional disclosure.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nAs reflected in the following table, Centrue Bank was considered well-capitalized\u201d under regulatory defined capital ratios as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>To Be Adequately\nCapitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>To Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt Corrective\nAction Provisions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital (to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Financial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Bank\n</td> <td>117,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier I (to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Financial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Bank\n</td> <td>109,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier I capital (to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Financial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Bank\n</td> <td>109,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier I leverage ratio (to average assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Financial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Centrue Bank\n</td> <td>109,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation, Changing Prices, and Monetary Policies\nThe financial statements and related financial data concerning the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve-Chicago.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning recent accounting developments.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to address the significant factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. When we use the terms Centrue,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d we mean Centrue Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank,\u201d we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank.\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. All financial information in the following tables is displayed in thousands (000s), except per share data.\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by the use of words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" planned\u201d or potential\u201d or similar expressions.\nThe Company's ability to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company and the subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in: interest rates; general economic conditions; legislative/regulatory changes; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; the quality and composition of the loan or securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the Company's market areas; the Company's implementation of new technologies; the Company's ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of Centrue's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nCentrue's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies are deemed critical:\nSecurities: Securities are classified as available-for-sale when Centrue may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in yields on alternative investments, and for other reasons. They are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. All of Centrue's securities are classified as available-for-sale. For all securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. Due to the limited nature of the market for certain securities, the fair value and potential sale proceeds could be materially different in the event of a sale.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in securities gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\ntheir amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether the loss is temporary or other-than-temporary. If the Company (a) has the intent to sell a debt security or (b) is more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire unrealized loss in earnings as an other-than-temporary loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and (b) the amount of total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company also evaluates whether the decline in fair value of an equity security is temporary or other-than-temporary. In determining whether an unrealized loss on an equity security is temporary or other-than-temporary, management considers various factors including the magnitude and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security to forecasted recovery.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on an estimation computed pursuant to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance and rules stating that the analysis of the allowance for loan losses consists of three components:\n \u2022 Specific Component. The specific credit allocation component is based on an analysis of individual impaired loans over a fixed-dollar amount where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the market price of the loan, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost of sale. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values; \n \u2022 Historical Loss Component. The historical loss component is mathematically based using a modified loss migration analysis that examines historical loan loss experience for each loan category. The loss migration is performed quarterly and loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience. The general portfolio allocation element of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of the amounts necessary for concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume. The methodology utilized by management to calculate the historical loss portion of the allowance adequacy analysis is based on historical losses. This historical loss period is based on a weighted twelve-quarter average (3 years); and \n \u2022 Qualitative Component. The qualitative component requires qualitative judgment and estimates reserves based on general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors believed to be relevant to the markets in which the Company operates. The process for determining the allowance (which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses) includes subjective elements and, therefore, may be susceptible to significant change.  To the extent actual outcomes differs from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the Company's earnings or financial position in future periods.\nOther Real Estate Owned: Other real estate owned includes properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans. Properties are recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of other real estate owned. Any write-downs of the properties subsequent to acquisition, as well as gains or losses on disposition and income or expense from the operations of other real estate owned, are recognized in operating results in the period they are realized.\nIncome Taxes: We determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences result in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nWe assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management makes judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nManagement also makes certain interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of the tax position may not be certain. Uncertain tax positions are periodically evaluated and we may establish tax reserves for benefits that may not be realized. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 11 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nCentrue Financial Corporation is a bank holding company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company provides a full range of products and services to individual and corporate customers extending from the far western and southern suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area across Central Illinois down to the metropolitan St. Louis area. These products and services include demand, time, and savings deposits; lending; mortgage banking, brokerage, asset management, and trust services. Brokerage, asset management, and trust services are provided to our customers on a referral basis to third party providers. The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions, including banks, thrifts and credit unions, as well as nonfinancial institutions providing financial services. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiary, Centrue Bank, are subject to regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income (Loss)\n2015 compared to 2014. Net income equaled $42.6 million or $11.08 per common diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a net loss of $4.5 million or $(44.81) per common diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were positively impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset (\"DTA\") valuation allowance which provided a tax benefit during the year in the amount of $38.2 million and a $1.8 million gain on extinguishment of debt, representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration issued in the settlement transaction and the carrying value of the amounts due in connection with the settlement of obligations. 2014 results were impacted by a $3.9 million loss attributed to a bulk asset sale.\nNet Interest Income/ Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for the funding sources used to finance these assets. Changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and rates earned and paid, respectively, on those assets and liabilities. The net yield on total interest-earning assets, also referred to as net interest margin, represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin measures how efficiently the Company uses its earning assets and underlying capital. The Company's long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital risks. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax-exempt securities and loans.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNet interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $2.2 million from $24.2 million earned during the full year 2014 to $26.4 million for the full year 2015. This was the result of an increase in interest income, as well as, a decrease in interest expense.\nTax equivalent interest income rose $1.1 million as compared to 2014. A $47.2 million increase in interest-earning assets improved interest income by $1.7 million with the increases in both the securities and loan portfolios. A nine basis point decline in the average yield on interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $0.6 million as securities, with lower yields than loans, made up a larger proportion of interest-earning assets during 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest expense declined $1.0 million as compared to 2014. A $19.2 million decrease in interest-bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by an immaterial amount. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was largely concentrated in high cost time deposits. A fourteen basis point decline in total funding costs reduced interest expense by $1.0 million as high cost time deposits matured and were replaced with non-maturing deposits.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe net interest margin increased seven basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.33% during the same period in 2014. The Company's margin improved as it grew new loans, reduced nonaccruing loans in the portfolio, reduced high cost time deposits and paid-off debt obligations.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nNet interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $0.1 million from $24.1 million earned during the full year 2013 to $24.2 million for the full year 2014. This was the result of a decrease in interest expense more than offsetting a decrease in interest income.\nTax-equivalent interest income declined $0.6 million as compared to 2013 based on a decrease of $21.5 million in interest-earning assets reducing interest income by $0.8 million. The decrease in interest-earning assets was largely due to a reduction in securities. A three basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets improved interest income by $0.2 million as nonaccrual loans were replaced with new loans and lower yielding securities were sold and replaced with higher yielding instruments.\nInterest expense declined $0.8 million as compared to 2013 based on a $33.1 million decrease in interest-bearing liabilities reducing interest expense by $0.2 million. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was largely due to strategic initiatives to reduce high cost time deposits and FHLB advances with proceeds from successful troubled loan workouts and the bulk asset sale. A nine basis point decline in total funding costs reduced interest expense by $0.6 million as the pricing on deposits were lowered and maturing time deposits either repriced at significantly lower rates or were not retained.\nThe net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.33% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3.21% during the same period in 2013. Positively impacting the margin was a reduction in the Company's cost of interest-bearing liabilities due to maturity of higher rate time deposits and the decline in market interest rates. Negatively impacting the margin was the cost of retaining surplus liquidity, average loan volume decline and the impact of nonaccrual loan interest reversals.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\n\n\n(1) Average balance and average rate on securities classified as available-for-sale is based on historical amortized cost balances.\n(2) Interest income and average rate on tax exempt securities are reflected on a tax equivalent basis based upon a statutory federal income tax rate of 34%.\n(3) In 2015 there was $53 in tax equivalent interest included in gross loans and $55 in 2014.\n(4) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balances; overdraft loans are excluded in the balances.\n(5) Loan fees are included in the specific loan category.\n(6) Average balances are derived from daily balances.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\n\n\n(1) Average balance and average rate on securities classified as available-for-sale is based on historical amortized cost balances.\n(2) Interest income and average rate on tax exempt securities are reflected on a tax equivalent basis based upon a statutory federal income tax rate of 34%.\n(3) In 2014 there was $55 in tax equivalent interest included in gross loans and $42 in 2013.\n(4) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balances; overdraft loans are excluded in the balances.\n(5) Loan fees are included in the specific loan category.\n(6) Average balances are derived from daily balances.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe Company's net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as \"volume change\". It is also affected by changes in yield earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds referred to as \"rate change\". The following table reflects the changes in net interest income stemming from changes in interest rates and from asset and liability volume, including mix. Any variance attributed jointly to volume and rate change is allocated to the volume and rate variances in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe amount of the provision for loan losses is based on management's evaluations of the loan portfolio, with particular attention directed toward nonperforming, impaired and other potential problem loans. During these evaluations, consideration is also given to such factors as management's evaluation of specific loans, the level and composition of impaired loans, other nonperforming loans, other identified potential problem loans, historical loss experience, results of examinations by regulatory agencies, results of the independent asset quality review process, the market value of collateral, the estimate of discounted cash flows, the strength and availability of guarantees, concentrations of credits and various other factors, including concentration of credit risk in various industries and current economic conditions.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nThe Company recorded $0.4 million of provision for loan losses during 2015 in comparison to $7.2 million recorded in the same period in 2014. The reduced need for provision charge during the period was driven by the following factors:\n \u2022 No material migrations of performing loans to nonperforming status from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015; \n \u2022 Charge-offs during the period were offset by recoveries, resulting in net recoveries for the year; \n \u2022 Provision level in 2014 was impacted by a bulk asset sale; \n \u2022 Continued stabilization of collateral values.  Management continues to update collateral values and evaluate the level of specific allocations for impaired loans. As impaired loans have moved through the liquidation process, many of the previously established specific allocations have been charged off.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\n2014 compared to 2013.\nThe 2014 provision for loan losses charged to operating expense totaled $7.2 million, an increase of $3.8 million in comparison to $3.4 million recorded in the 2013 period. The largest part of the increase was related to the bulk asset sale that was completed in late 2014 and increased the provision charge by $2.9 million. Additionally the provision level for 2014 was driven by more aggressive workout strategies as the Company made a significant improvement to asset quality during the year.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income consists of a wide variety of fee-based revenues, including bank-related service charges on deposits, mortgage revenues and increases in cash surrender value on bank-owned life insurance.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest income totaled $12.4 million for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $12.8 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding gains related to the sale of OREO, securities and other non-recurring gains, noninterest income decreased by $0.6 million or 5.9%. The decline from 2014 can be attributed to a decrease in mortgage banking income along with a decline in service charge income.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nTotal noninterest income was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2013. This represented a decrease of $3.9 million in 2014 over the prior period. Included in 2014 and 2013 noninterest income results were securities gains, gains related to the sale of OREO and other gains. Excluding these items from both periods, recurring noninterest income declined $0.7 million or 6.4% in 2014 versus 2013 levels. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease related to reduced mortgage banking income due to lower production.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense is comprised primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expense.\n2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $33.2 million which was $1.0 million lower than the year ended December 31, 2014. When excluding the OREO valuation adjustments and other non-recurring items, noninterest expense was $0.4 million, or 1.3%, above the comparable amount for 2014 driven by an increase in salaries and partially offset by a reduction in FDIC premium expense.\n2014 compared to 2013.\nNoninterest expense totaled $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $33.5 million for the same period in 2013. This represented an increase of $0.7 million or 2.1% in 2014 from 2013. Included in 2014 and 2013 noninterest expense results were OREO valuation adjustments. Excluding OREO valuations noninterest expense was flat in 2014 compared to 2013. Multiple categories saw expense improvement including: salary & benefits, marketing, loan processing and OREO carrying costs. These savings were offset by increasing occupancy, equipment and data processing costs.\nApplicable Income Taxes\nIn accordance with current income tax accounting guidance, the Company assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets (DTAs) based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard. The most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to (1) net operating loss carryforwards and (2) the allowance for loan losses.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of DTAs were evaluated. The ultimate realization of DTAs is based on the Company's ability to carryback net operating losses to prior tax periods, tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible, and the reversal of deductible temporary differences that can be offset by taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.\nIn 2010, the Company established a valuation allowance of $31.5 million against its DTAs because it concluded that, based upon the weight of all available evidence, it was more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. The valuation allowance increased to $39.8 million at December 31, 2014 due mainly to increases in the net operating loss carryforwards each year from 2010 through 2014. The valuation allowance decreased to $38.2 million before being reversed to zero at December 31, 2015 due to taxable income generated in 2015 which reduced the net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, management determined that is it more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax asset will be realized. This conclusion was based on\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nan analysis of both positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence included our return to profitability and positive three year cumulative pre-tax earnings as of December 31, 2015, significant improvement in asset quality and credit ratios, positive loan growth throughout 2015, future taxable income based on robust forecasting models including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies if needed, and the termination of the Company's Written Agreement by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. Negative evidence included a pre-tax loss in 2014, no available taxes paid in open carryback years, and the fact that the banking industry is highly competitive and heavily regulated. Management determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative and therefore the Company released the $38.2 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset on December 31, 2015 resulting in an income tax benefit.\nDuring 2014, the Company recorded no income tax expense or benefit, despite a loss of $4.5 million before income taxes. A current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre-tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance. After evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence, the Company determined a full valuation allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2014.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Management\nThe business of the Company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) which are funded for the most part by interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). All of the financial instruments of the Company are held for investment rather than trading purposes. Such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity of economic value to changes in market rates of interest, but also sensitivity in coupon income for adjustable rate instruments and reinvestment income of maturing instruments. The operating income and net income of the Bank depends, to a substantial extent, on rate differentials,\u201d i.e., the differences between the income the Bank receives from loans, securities, and other earning assets and the interest expense they pay to obtain deposits and other funding sources. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Bank, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nThe Company measures its overall interest rate sensitivity through a multiple scenario analysis. The primary analysis measures the change in net interest income resulting from instantaneous hypothetical changes in interest rates. This analysis assesses the risk of changes in net interest income in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 300 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates. Due to the current rate environment, this analysis was done in 2015 using a 100 basis point decrease in rates versus the normal 100 to 300 basis point decreases. Computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including parallel shifts of market interest rates, loan and security prepayments, and deposit run-off rates and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Actual values may differ from those projections set forth above, should market conditions vary from the assumptions used in preparing the analysis. Further, the computations do not contemplate actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The interest rates scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements.\nThe tables below present the Company's projected changes in net interest income for December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for the various rate shock levels.\n\nAs shown above, the effect of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2015 would increase the Company's net interest income by $1.3 million or 4.4%. The effect of an immediate 100 basis point decrease in rates would decrease the Company's net interest income by $1.5 million or 5.4%.\nDuring 2015, management continued to position the balance sheet to generate a benefit to income in a rising interest rate environment. This was accomplished by allowing the fixed rate securities to run off and replacing them with adjustable rate\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nsecurities. The loan portfolio had a lower amount of loans on which interest was not accruing at the end of the year, thus having a larger percentage of the total benefitting from rising interest rates. The primary factor increasing the benefit to the margin from rising interest rates was the greater percentage of funding coming from non-maturity deposits. These deposits tend to be less sensitive to rising interest rates as these are primarily transaction balances. This is somewhat related to the general industry trend of an influx of funds from money market mutual funds which will likely be less secure funding. This makes it necessary to invest these funds focusing on less volatile assets. With the influx of deposits into non-maturity accounts there was reduced dependence on time deposits and from wholesale funding. Time deposits and wholesale funding tend to have the highest sensitivity to rising interest rates and our reduced concentration of this type of funding allows greater benefit to the margin from rising interest rates.\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral\nFollowing are highlights of the December 31, 2015 balance sheet when compared to December 31, 2014:\nLoans. The Company offers a broad range of products, including commercial; agricultural production and agricultural real estate; construction, land and development; commercial real estate, 1-4 family mortgages; and consumer loans, designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company's loans are diversified by borrower and industry group.\nOutstanding loans totaled $633.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $553.2 million at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $80.3 million or 14.52%. This increase is primarily due to a combination of new organic loan growth and normal seasonal line draws offset by the classification of $11.5 million of loans included in branch assets held for sale due to our agreement to sell three branches. See Note 19. Subsequent Events for additional disclosure related to the branch sales.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, commitments of the Bank under standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit totaled approximately $151.8 million and $115.3 million.\n\nThe maturities presented above are based upon contractual maturities. Many of these loans are made on a short-term basis with the possibility of renewal at time of maturity.\nRate sensitivities of the total loan portfolio, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2015 were as follows:\n\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nNonperforming Assets\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio, unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans. If a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the loan does not generate current period income for the Company and any amounts received are generally applied first to principal and then to interest. It is the policy of the Company not to renegotiate the terms of a loan because of a delinquent status. Rather, a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond 90 days.\nThe classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible, in whole or in part. The Bank makes a determination as to collectability on a case-by-case basis and considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans. The final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation. Alternatives that are typically considered to collect nonaccrual loans are foreclosure, collection under guarantees, loan restructuring, or judicial collection actions.\nOther nonperforming assets consist of real estate acquired through loan foreclosures or other workout situations and other assets acquired through repossessions.\nEach of the Company's commercial loans is assigned a risk rating at origination based upon an internally developed grading system. A separate credit administration department also reviews selected grade assignments on a quarterly basis. Management continuously monitors nonperforming, impaired, and past due loans in an effort to prevent further deterioration of these loans. The Company has an independent loan review function which is separate from the lending function and is responsible for the review of new and existing loans.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of nonperforming assets:\n\nThe Company's level of nonperforming assets has declined significantly over the past two years mainly due to the sale of $35.2 million of troubled assets through the bulk asset sale completed on December 5, 2014 which included the sale of $9.5 million in nonaccrual loans and $7.7 million in OREO. Total nonperforming assets declined $3.6 million to $14.4 million, or 1.50% of total assets, at December 31, 2015 from $18.0 million at December 31, 2014. Total nonperforming assets included $0.2 million in troubled debt restructures, $8.4 million of foreclosed assets and repossessed real estate, and $5.8 million of nonaccrual loans compared to $10.3 million of foreclosed assets and $7.7 million of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014. Approximately 2.11% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015 were concentrated in land development, construction and commercial real estate credits. Additionally $3.6 million or 60.28% of total nonaccrual loans represented a multi-family loan to one borrower.\nNonperforming Loans\nNonperforming loans (nonaccrual, 90 days past due and troubled debt restructures) decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, largely due to successful workout asset sale strategies.\nThe level of nonperforming loans to end of period loans was 0.93% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to 1.40% as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the decrease in the nonperforming loans, the allowance to nonperforming loan coverage ratio increased to 143.02% for year ended December 31, 2015 from 102.99% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nOther Real Estate Owned\nForeclosure of impaired loans has resulted in elevated levels of other real estate owned (OREO) as foreclosed properties have been especially difficult to move in the current economic environment. OREO was $8.4 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $10.3 million as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, the Company transferred $0.3 million of foreclosed or repossessed real estate from the loan portfolio. OREO properties with a carrying value of $5.2 million were written down to their fair value of $4.9 million, resulting in a charge to earnings of $0.3 million. This compares to 2014 when OREO properties with a carrying value of $6.0 million were written down to their fair value of $4.5 million, which resulted in a charge to earnings of $1.5 million during the year.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of other real estate owned at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n\nOther Potential Problem Loans\nThe Company has other potential problem loans that are currently performing, but where some concerns exist regarding the nature of the borrowers' projects in our current economic environment. As of December 31, 2015, management identified $0.1 million of loans that are currently performing but due to the economic environment facing these borrowers were classified by management as impaired. Impaired loans that are performing account for 1.44% of the loans deemed impaired during 2015. Excluding nonperforming loans and loans that management has classified as impaired, there are other potential problem loans that totaled $5.3 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $8.5 million at December 31, 2014. The classification of these loans, however, does not imply that management expects losses on each of these loans, but believes that a higher level of scrutiny and closer monitoring is prudent under the circumstances. Such classifications relate to specific concerns for each individual borrower and do not relate to any concentration risk common to all loans in this group.\nThe Company proactively reviews loans for potential impairment regardless of the payment or performance status. This approach results in some relationships being classified as impaired but still performing.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $8.6 million, or 1.33% of total loans, as compared to $8.0 million, or 1.44% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. The Company recorded $0.4 million of provision to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 largely due to net loan growth.\nActivity in the Allowance for years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows.\n\nDuring December 2014, the Company entered into a bulk loan sale where $18.0 million of classified loans were sold, at a discount of approximately 24% of their carrying value. This bulk loan sale reduced the level of classified loans by 56.7%. The Allowance for these loans individually evaluated for impairment at the time of sale totaled $3.7 million.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe components of the Allowance for Loan Losses ( Allowance\u201d) at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows.\n\nThe general component of the Allowance covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component also includes loans that are not individually identified for impairment evaluation, as well as those loans that are individually evaluated but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for factors. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; migration of loans to the classification of special mention, substandard or doubtful; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentration.\nThe establishment of the Allowance involves a high degree of judgment and includes a level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all of the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses occur.\nNet loan charge-offs for 2015 resulted in a net recovery of $0.2 million, or (0.04)% of average loans, compared with a net charge-off of $10.9 million, or 1.90% of average loans, in the same period of 2014. Management believes losses are being recognized in our portfolio through charge-offs as they are confirmed.\nOf the $8.6 million allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015, $5.7 million, or 66.28%, was allocated to commercial real estate loans. Management monitors these collateral dependent real estate loans periodically to analyze the adequacy of the cash flows to support the debt levels and obtains updated appraisals to determine the collateral's fair value for impairment analysis.\nManagement continues to diligently monitor the loan portfolio, paying particular attention to borrowers with land development, residential and commercial real estate, and commercial development exposures. Should the economic climate deteriorate from current levels, more borrowers may experience repayment difficulty, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, potentially requiring increases in the provision for loan losses. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents a ratio analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses:\n\nSecurities. The primary strategic objective of the Company's $171.4 million securities - available-for-sale from December 31, 2015, which excludes restricted securities, is to minimize interest rate risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and maximize return. In managing the securities portfolio, the Company minimizes any credit risk and avoids investments in sophisticated and complex investment products. The portfolio includes several callable agency debentures, adjustable rate mortgage pass-throughs, municipal bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations. Collateralized mortgage obligations currently owned are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Neither the Company nor the Bank hold any securities containing sub-prime mortgages or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac equities. The Company does not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nThe Company's financial planning anticipates income streams generated by the securities portfolio based on normal maturity and reinvestment. Securities classified as available-for-sale, carried at fair value, were $171.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nto $135.4 million at December 31, 2014. The Company also holds Federal Reserve Board and Federal Home Loan Bank stock which are classified as restricted securities of $9.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nDeposits. Deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificate accounts (including jumbo\u201d certificates in denominations of $100,000 or more), and retirement savings plans. The Company's average balance of total deposits was $707.0 million for 2015, representing a decrease of $37.7 million or 5.06% compared with the average balance of total deposits for 2014 of $744.7 million as higher cost time deposits matured and were not renewed.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the Bank's average deposits:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, average time deposits over $100,000 represented 10.22% of total average deposits, compared with 12.53% of total average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company's large denomination time deposits are generally from customers within the local market areas and provide a greater degree of stability than is typically associated with brokered deposit customers with limited business relationships.\nThe following table sets forth the remaining maturities for time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2015:\n\nBrokered deposits account for $21.3 million of the total from the table above and all of their maturities fall into either the Over six months through one year\u201d or \"Over one year\" categories.\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nThe following table presents various ratios for the Company:\n\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nLiquidity\nThe Company manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. In addition to the normal inflow of funds from core-deposit growth together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments, the Company utilizes other short-term funding sources such as brokered time deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, overnight federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short-term deposits from public entities, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nThe Company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases, which vary depending upon the time period. As the time period is expanded, other data is factored in, including estimated loan funding requirements, estimated loan payoffs, investment portfolio maturities or calls, and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs.\nThe Company classifies all of its securities as available-for-sale, thereby maintaining significant liquidity. The Company's liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the Company's loan portfolio, resulting in a steady stream of loan repayments. In managing its investment portfolio, the Company provides for staggered maturities so that cash flows are provided as such investments mature.\nThe Company's cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities offset by cash flows used in operating activities and investing activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2015, the Company experienced a positive net cash flow of $108.0 million in financing activities primarily due to the net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock as part of the March 31, 2015 recapitalization. In contrast, net cash outflows of $136.0 million were used by investing activities due to the purchase of available for sale securities and an overall increase in net loans. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million.\nThe Bank's securities portfolio, federal funds sold, and cash and due from bank deposit balances serve as the primary sources of liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2015, 13.47% of the Bank's interest-bearing deposits were in the form of time deposits of $100,000 and over. Management believes these deposits to be a stable source of funds. However, if a large number of these time deposits matured at approximately the same time and were not renewed, the Bank's liquidity could be adversely affected. Currently, the maturities of the large time deposits are spread throughout the year, with 19.73% maturing in the first quarter of 2016, 14.59% maturing in the second quarter of 2016, 31.89% maturing in the third and fourth quarter of 2016, and the remaining 33.79% maturing thereafter. The Bank monitors those maturities in an effort to minimize any adverse effect on liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2015, borrowings included $10.0 million each for Centrue Statutory Trust II and Centrue Statutory Trust III. The principal source of debt service payments for these obligations is from the net proceeds of the Company's recent capital financing. Borrowings held at the Bank include $76.0 million in FHLB advances and $18.7 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase; the debt service for the Bank's borrowings is provided by operating cash flows from the Bank.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet financial instruments. The following tables summarize the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commitments and off balance sheet instruments as of December 31, 2015:\n\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nCommitments, Contingencies, and Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nSome financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $149.8 million in outstanding loan commitments including outstanding commitments for various lines of credit and $2.0 million of standby letters of credit. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' Equity\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $121.3 million, an increase of $91.0 million from $30.3 million at December 31, 2014. The change in stockholders' equity during 2015 was largely the result of a recapitalization through the issuance of 6.3 million shares of Centrue common stock with aggregate gross proceeds of $76.0 million and net proceeds of $69.0 million after issuance costs. Average equity as a percentage of average assets was 7.94% at December 31, 2015 compared to 4.19% at December 31, 2014. Book value per common share equaled $18.21 at December 31, 2015, an increase from $(32.93) reported at the end of 2014.\nCapital Measurements\nThe Company and the Bank ( Regulated Companies\u201d) are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by these regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Regulated Companies must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Their capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Regulated Companies to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and of Tier 1 Capital to average assets. Tier 1 Capital includes common stockholders' equity, qualifying preferred stock and Trust Preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other deductions (including the unrealized net gains and losses, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale securities carried at fair value). CET1 is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not CET1.Total Capital includes Tier 1 Capital plus preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, mandatory convertible debt, subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations by the guidelines.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved rules that implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nBasel III also introduced changes to risk-weightings and treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). In 2015, the Bank made a one-time available election to opt-out of the impact of certain unrealized capital gains and losses in AOCI being included in regulatory capital. There is no opportunity to change methodology in future periods.\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company completed a common stock offering and capital infusion into the Bank. See Note 1 to the Audited Financial Statements for additional disclosure.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART II: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nAs reflected in the following table, Centrue Bank was considered well-capitalized\u201d under regulatory defined capital ratios as of December 31, 2015.\n\nImpact of Inflation, Changing Prices, and Monetary Policies\nThe financial statements and related financial data concerning the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve-Chicago.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for

the MD&A report:\n\n- Net income was $42.6 million in 2015 compared to a net loss of $4.5 million in 2014. The improvement was largely due to reversing the deferred tax asset valuation allowance which provided a $38.2 million tax benefit. \n\n- Net interest income increased from $24.2 million in 2014 to $26.4 million in 2015, driven by growth in interest-earning assets and lower funding costs. Net interest margin improved from 3.33% to 3.40%.\n\n- Provision for loan losses decreased from $7.2 million in 2014 to $0.4 million in 2015 as asset quality improved. \n\n- Total loans grew 14.5% to $633.5 million at December 31, 2015. Asset quality metrics improved as nonperforming assets declined to 1.50% of total assets.\n\n- Average total deposits declined 5.1% to $707.0 million in 2015 as higher cost time deposits were allowed to run off. \n\n- Stockholders' equity increased to $121.3 million at December 31, 2015, largely due to a $69.0 million capital raise. All bank capital ratios exceeded well-capitalized levels.\n\n- Net income improved dramatically in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and continued improvement in asset quality and core earnings."}
