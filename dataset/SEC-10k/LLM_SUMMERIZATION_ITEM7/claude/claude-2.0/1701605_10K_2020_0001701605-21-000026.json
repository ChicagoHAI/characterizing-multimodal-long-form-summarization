MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nFor management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 please refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS).\nWe sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments. Throughout 2020, the industry experienced multiple factors which drove expectations for global oil and gas related spending to be lower than 2019. First, the COVID-19 pandemic lowered global demand for hydrocarbons, as social distancing and travel restrictions were implemented across the world. Second, the lifting of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) supply curtailments in the first quarter of 2020, and the associated increase in production, drove the global excess supply of hydrocarbons higher. In the second quarter of 2020, OPEC+ reached a supply curtailment agreement of up to 10 million barrels per day, which drove expectations for future hydrocarbon supply lower. After significant turmoil during the first half of the year from the industry downturn, oil markets stabilized and demand for oil improved in the second half of the year. Lastly, global gross domestic product (GDP) declined in 2020, as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the health and safety of our employees has continued to be a top priority. We have taken critical steps as a company to reduce the risk of exposure, as well as mitigate the impacts of this pandemic to our employees, contractors and partners. We have adopted remote working where possible. Where on-site operations are required, masks are mandatory and our employees have adopted social distancing. We have worked with our employees to implement other site-specific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure. We are collaborating closely with our customers, suppliers, and vendors to minimize operational disruption. In addition, we have restricted non-essential business travel and have encouraged our employees, customers and partners to collaborate virtually.\nOur goal throughout the downturn in 2020 was to remain disciplined in allocating capital, focus on liquidity and cash preservation, and to preserve our investment grade rating while also maintaining our current dividend payout.\nDuring the year, we took necessary actions to right-size the business for expected activity levels. In the first quarter of 2020, we approved a plan for restructuring and other actions totaling $1.8 billion, which was increased by $0.3 billion as we took further actions during the year to address the continuing industry challenges. Total restructuring and other costs were $2.1 billion in 2020. These charges are primarily related to the costs for reductions in work force, product line exits in certain geographies, and the write down of inventory and intangible assets. These actions took place across the business and our corporate functions. We expect the cash payback of these actions to be less than one year.\nIn addition, during the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly driven by the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred, and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14.8 billion during the first quarter of 2020. There were no other goodwill impairments in 2020.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 28\nIn 2020, we generated revenue of $20.7 billion, compared to $23.8 billion in 2019. The decrease in revenue was driven by declines in all four of our segments primarily due to the industry downturn. Loss before income taxes was $15.2 billion in 2020, and included goodwill impairment charges of $14.8 billion, restructuring and impairment charges of $1.9 billion, inventory impairment charges of $246 million, separation and merger related costs of $134 million, and a gain of $1.4 billion related to our investment in C3.ai recorded in other non-operating income. In 2019, income before income taxes was $0.8 billion, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $342 million, and separation and merger related costs of $184 million.\nThe gain of $1.4 billion related to our C3.ai investment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. We invested in C3.ai when we formed our partnership in June 2019. In December 2020, C3.ai completed its initial public offering, which requires us to mark our investment to fair value. Both our investment and strong partnership with C3.ai demonstrate our commitment for growth in high potential segments as we develop and market new AI solutions for the oil and gas industry.\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. After significant volatility during the first half of 2020, oil markets stabilized during the second half of the year. However, there is still uncertainty in the global economic outlook and impact on oil and gas markets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022North America onshore activity: in 2020, we experienced a significant decline in rig count, as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices. We expect North American onshore activity to improve in 2021, as compared to the second half of 2020.\n\u2022International onshore activity: in 2020, we experienced a decline in rig count, as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices. We expect onshore spending outside of North America to stabilize in early 2021, and see a modest recovery over the second half of the year.\n\u2022Offshore projects: in 2020, we experienced significantly fewer offshore projects reaching positive final investment decisions, due to the economic uncertainty and lower oil and gas prices. In 2021, we expect the offshore markets to stabilize and for the number of tree awards in the market to remain stable or grow modestly compared to 2020 levels.\n\u2022Liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market long term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.\nWe have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including GDP, such as our Digital Solutions segment.\nWe also have segments within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around decarbonization of energy and industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and energy storage. We expect to see continued growth in these segments as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing activity levels in the near term. While governments may change or discontinue incentives for renewable energy additions, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nOver time, we believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 29\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n</td> <td>39.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n</td> <td>2.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Energy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n(2)EIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price\n(3)EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nOutside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. After a stable and positive 2019, volatility increased sharply in April 2020 when oil prices dropped nearly 87%, due to lower demand. Brent oil prices decreased from a high of $70.25/Bbl in January 2020, to a low of $9.12/Bbl in April 2020. The average Brent oil prices decreased to $41.96/Bbl in 2020 from $64.28/Bbl in 2019, due to lower prices during majority of the year 2020.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similarly to Brent oil prices, on average decreased to $39.16/Bbl in 2020 from $56.98/Bbl in 2019, and ranged from a high of $63.27/Bbl in January 2020, to a low of $(36.98)/Bbl in April 2020.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.03/mmBtu in 2020, representing a 21% decrease over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a low of $1.33/mmBtu in September 2020, to a high of $3.14/mmBtu in October 2020. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2020 was 3,460 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 7.7%, or 268 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2019.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 30\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, Ukraine was added to the Baker Hughes international rig count. The Company will continue tracking active drilling rigs in the country going forward. Historical periods will not be updated.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International </td> <td>827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 Compared to 2019\nOverall the rig count was 1,349 in 2020, a decrease of 38% as compared to 2019 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America decreased 52% and the international rig count decreased 25% in 2020 compared to 2019, both as a result of lower commodity prices and exploration and production capital expenditure reductions.\nWithin North America, the decrease was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was down 54% on average when compared to the same period last year, and a decrease in the Canadian rig count, which was down 33% on average. Internationally, the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the Latin America region, Africa region and Europe region of 44%, 34% and 24%, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 31\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, goodwill and inventory impairments, separation-related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOur statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which goods\u201d is required to include all sales of tangible products and services\u201d must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between equipment\u201d and product services,\u201d where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to product services\u201d simply as services\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOrders: We recognized orders of $20.7 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, equipment orders were down 27% and service orders were down 20%, compared to 2019.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $23.4 billion and $22.9 billion, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 32\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income for each of our four operating segments is provided below.

2019\nRevenue in 2020 was $20,705 million, a decrease of $3,133 million, or 13%, from 2019. This decrease in revenue was largely a result of decreased activity in OFS, DS and OFE, partially offset by an increase in TPS. OFS decreased $2,749 million, DS decreased $477 million, OFE decreased $77 million, and TPS increased $169 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2020 was $1,504 million, a decrease of $531 million, or 26%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by OFS, which decreased $430 million, OFE, which decreased $36 million and DS, which decreased $150 million, partially offset by TPS, which increased $86 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2020 revenue was $10,140 million, a decrease of $2,749 million from 2019, as a result of decreased activity in North America and international in 2020 compared to 2019, as evidenced by a decline in the corresponding rig counts. North America revenue was $2,802 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,794 million from\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 33\n2019. International revenue was $7,338 million in 2020, a decrease of $955 million from 2019, driven by declines in most regions, primarily in the Middle East and Latin America regions.\nOFS 2020 segment operating income was $487 million, compared to $917 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume, and to a lesser extent, unfavorable business mix, partially offset by our restructuring and productivity initiatives.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2020 revenue was $2,844 million, a decrease of $77 million, or 3%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the services business, mostly driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher volume in the subsea production systems and flexible pipe businesses. The decrease was also impacted by the sale of the Surface Pressure Control Flow business in October 2020.\nOFE 2020 segment operating income was $19 million, compared to $55 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable business mix and to a lesser extent by lower volume.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2020 revenue was $5,705 million, an increase of $169 million, or 3%, from 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher equipment and projects revenue, partially offset by lower services volume as well as business dispositions that occurred in 2019. Equipment revenue in 2020 represented 44% and Service revenue represented 56% of total revenue. Equipment revenue was up 27% year-over-year, and services revenue was down 10% year-over-year, partially due to mobility restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTPS 2020 segment operating income was $805 million, compared to $719 million in 2019. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher cost productivity and to a lesser extent by higher volume, partially offset by unfavorable business mix.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2020 revenue was $2,015 million, a decrease of $477 million, or 19%, from 2019, driven by volume declines across most DS segments, largely driven by lower economic activity related to COVID-19 disruptions.\nDS 2020 segment operating income was $193 million, compared to $343 million in 2019. The decrease in profitability was primarily driven by lower volume.\nCorporate\nIn 2020, corporate expenses were $464 million, an increase of $31 million compared to 2019, primarily from the additional expenses related to the separation from GE.\nInventory Impairment\nIn 2020, we recorded inventory impairments of $246 million, primarily related to our Oilfield Services segment as a result of certain restructuring activities initiated by the Company. There were no inventory impairments recorded in 2019. Charges for inventory impairments are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company's market capitalization declined significantly driven by current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions including the decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices driven by both surplus production and supply. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14,773 million during the first quarter of 2020. There have been no other goodwill impairments during 2020.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 34\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2020, we recognized $1,866 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, compared to $342 million in 2019. These charges primarily relate to the restructuring plan announced in the first quarter of 2020, which include product line rationalization actions, headcount reductions in certain geographical locations, and other initiatives to right-size our operations for anticipated activity levels and market conditions.\nSeparation and Merger Related\nWe recorded $134 million of separation related costs in 2020, a decrease of $50 million from the prior year. Costs in 2020 relate to the ongoing activities for the separation from GE including costs for the build-out of certain information technology infrastructures as a result of the separation.\nOther Non-Operating Income /(Loss), Net\nIn 2020, we recorded $1,040 million of other net non-operating income. Included in this amount is an unrealized gain of $1,417 million related to marking our investment in C3.ai to fair value, partially offset by losses of $353 million for the sale of our Rod Lift Systems business in OFS and the sale of our Surface Pressure Control Flow business in OFE.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2020, we incurred net interest expense of $264 million, an increase of $27 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower interest income.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2020, our income tax expense was $559 million, an increase of $77 million, from $482 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the geographical mix of earnings, partially offset by the benefit of the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the U.S., and includes measures to assist companies, including allowing net operating losses originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to be carried back up to five years. During 2020, we elected to carry back losses to 2014 and accordingly recognized a tax benefit of $117 million and we expect to receive a cash refund of the same amount.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n\u2022Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.\n\u2022Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating concerns across all regions and countries where we do business.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 35\n\u2022Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), administrative service providers, as well as an enhanced risk-based process for classifying channel partners and suppliers.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities.\n\u2022Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.\n\u2022Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as product company and regional compliance committees that meet quarterly.\n\u2022Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.\n\u2022Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements.\n\u2022A compliance program designed to create an Open Reporting Environment\u201d where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages.\n\u2022Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies.\n\u2022Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties.\n\u2022We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire compliance training module for all employees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. Despite the challenging dynamics during 2020, we continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Our liquidity is further supported by a revolving credit facility of $3 billion, and access to both commercial paper and uncommitted lines of credit. At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or our uncommitted lines of credit, and had \u00a3600 million ($801 million) commercial paper outstanding. Our next debt maturity is December 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents includes $44 million and $162 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding cash held on behalf of GE, our U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $1 billion and $0.4 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion of our cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., they will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nWe have a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. The 2019 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 36\nwarranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. We have no borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. During the second quarter of 2020, we established a \u00a3600 million commercial paper facility under which the Bank of England may invest through the COVID Corporate Financing Facility (the Program), which increased our total commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to approximately $3.8 billion. In May 2020, we issued \u00a3600 million of commercial paper under the Program that matures in April 2021 and can be repaid prior to that with no additional cost.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See \"Note 10. Borrowings\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, restructuring and GE separation related costs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operating and financing activities, and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(618) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,045) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,534) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2019\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,304 million and $2,126 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, impairments, loss on sale of businesses, and the unrealized gain on an equity security) and working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets.\nWorking capital generated $216 million of cash in 2020 primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable, as we continue to improve our working capital processes. In 2019,\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 37\nworking capital generated $553 million of cash primarily due to net positive progress collections and receivables in TPS for equipment contracts. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2020 and 2019 are payments of $670 million and $307 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and separation-related costs including the build-out of information technology infrastructure as a result of GE separation activities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $618 million and $1,045 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $974 million and $1,240 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $187 million and $264 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2020, we received proceeds of $187 million primarily from the sale of our Rod Lift Systems and our Surface Pressure Control Flow businesses. In 2019, we received $77 million from the sale of our high-speed reciprocating compression business.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities generated cash of $225 million and used cash of $1,534 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $204 million and $542 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had repayments of our long-term debt of $42 million in 2020 and $570 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by our repayment of certain senior notes.\nIn 2020, we had proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of \u00a3600 million ($737 million at date of issuance). In addition, we had proceeds from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.486% Senior Notes due May 2030. We pay interest on the notes each May and November. In 2019, we had proceeds from the issuance of $525 million aggregate principal amount of 3.138% Senior Notes due November 2029. We pay interest on the notes each May and November. We used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 3.2% Senior Notes due August 2021.\nDuring 2020, we paid aggregate dividends of $488 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHH LLC made a distribution of $256 million to GE. During 2019, we paid aggregate dividends of $395 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHH LLC made a distribution of $350 million to GE. Additionally, in September 2019, BHH LLC repurchased 11.9 million of its units from GE for a cash consideration of $250 million.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2021, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. When necessary, we issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposal of assets, in 2021 are expected to be below 2020 levels. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $350 million to $450 million in 2021.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 38\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>4 - 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and finance lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>3,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including finance lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of BHI. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and finance lease obligations includes $45 million payable to GE and its affiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year.\n(2)Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations.\n(3)Amounts represent the future minimum payments under operating leases with initial terms of one year or more. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n(4)Purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2020 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $601 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 12. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. In 2020, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $39 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding between approximately $30 million to $45 million in 2021. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2021. See \"Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than those discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 39\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, Baker Hughes filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2020, BHH LLC, Baker Hughes Netherlands Funding Company B.V., and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in December 2023.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2020, 16% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the U.S. Other than the U.S., no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2019, 19% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the U.S.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 76% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2020. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nSupply chain finance programs: Under supply chain finance programs, administered by a third party, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. These liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our condensed consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 40\nfollowing are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 7. Contract and Other Deferred Assets\" and \"Note 8. Progress Collections and Deferred Income\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $17 million, $(1) million and $26 million for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2020, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues, of $0.3 billion, represent approximately 2.9% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $11.2 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 41\nassessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 1.66% and 2.34%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 4.20% and 5.48%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and the U.S. GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. This rate is further impacted by the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested as repatriation of these foreign earnings would incur other additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $483 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 42\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality, and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for credit losses totaled $373 million and $323 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements, and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, inventory reserves totaled $421 million and $429 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nFor management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 please refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS).\nWe sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments. Throughout 2020, the industry experienced multiple factors which drove expectations for global oil and gas related spending to be lower than 2019. First, the COVID-19 pandemic lowered global demand for hydrocarbons, as social distancing and travel restrictions were implemented across the world. Second, the lifting of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) supply curtailments in the first quarter of 2020, and the associated increase in production, drove the global excess supply of hydrocarbons higher. In the second quarter of 2020, OPEC+ reached a supply curtailment agreement of up to 10 million barrels per day, which drove expectations for future hydrocarbon supply lower. After significant turmoil during the first half of the year from the industry downturn, oil markets stabilized and demand for oil improved in the second half of the year. Lastly, global gross domestic product (GDP) declined in 2020, as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the health and safety of our employees has continued to be a top priority. We have taken critical steps as a company to reduce the risk of exposure, as well as mitigate the impacts of this pandemic to our employees, contractors and partners. We have adopted remote working where possible. Where on-site operations are required, masks are mandatory and our employees have adopted social distancing. We have worked with our employees to implement other site-specific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure. We are collaborating closely with our customers, suppliers, and vendors to minimize operational disruption. In addition, we have restricted non-essential business travel and have encouraged our employees, customers and partners to collaborate virtually.\nOur goal throughout the downturn in 2020 was to remain disciplined in allocating capital, focus on liquidity and cash preservation, and to preserve our investment grade rating while also maintaining our current dividend payout.\nDuring the year, we took necessary actions to right-size the business for expected activity levels. In the first quarter of 2020, we approved a plan for restructuring and other actions totaling $1.8 billion, which was increased by $0.3 billion as we took further actions during the year to address the continuing industry challenges. Total restructuring and other costs were $2.1 billion in 2020. These charges are primarily related to the costs for reductions in work force, product line exits in certain geographies, and the write down of inventory and intangible assets. These actions took place across the business and our corporate functions. We expect the cash payback of these actions to be less than one year.\nIn addition, during the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly driven by the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred, and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14.8 billion during the first quarter of 2020. There were no other goodwill impairments in 2020.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 28\nIn 2020, we generated revenue of $20.7 billion, compared to $23.8 billion in 2019. The decrease in revenue was driven by declines in all four of our segments primarily due to the industry downturn. Loss before income taxes was $15.2 billion in 2020, and included goodwill impairment charges of $14.8 billion, restructuring and impairment charges of $1.9 billion, inventory impairment charges of $246 million, separation and merger related costs of $134 million, and a gain of $1.4 billion related to our investment in C3.ai recorded in other non-operating income. In 2019, income before income taxes was $0.8 billion, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $342 million, and separation and merger related costs of $184 million.\nThe gain of $1.4 billion related to our C3.ai investment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. We invested in C3.ai when we formed our partnership in June 2019. In December 2020, C3.ai completed its initial public offering, which requires us to mark our investment to fair value. Both our investment and strong partnership with C3.ai demonstrate our commitment for growth in high potential segments as we develop and market new AI solutions for the oil and gas industry.\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. After significant volatility during the first half of 2020, oil markets stabilized during the second half of the year. However, there is still uncertainty in the global economic outlook and impact on oil and gas markets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022North America onshore activity: in 2020, we experienced a significant decline in rig count, as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices. We expect North American onshore activity to improve in 2021, as compared to the second half of 2020.\n\u2022International onshore activity: in 2020, we experienced a decline in rig count, as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices. We expect onshore spending outside of North America to stabilize in early 2021, and see a modest recovery over the second half of the year.\n\u2022Offshore projects: in 2020, we experienced significantly fewer offshore projects reaching positive final investment decisions, due to the economic uncertainty and lower oil and gas prices. In 2021, we expect the offshore markets to stabilize and for the number of tree awards in the market to remain stable or grow modestly compared to 2020 levels.\n\u2022Liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market long term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.\nWe have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including GDP, such as our Digital Solutions segment.\nWe also have segments within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around decarbonization of energy and industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and energy storage. We expect to see continued growth in these segments as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing activity levels in the near term. While governments may change or discontinue incentives for renewable energy additions, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nOver time, we believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 29\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n</td> <td>39.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n</td> <td>2.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Energy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n(2)EIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price\n(3)EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nOutside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. After a stable and positive 2019, volatility increased sharply in April 2020 when oil prices dropped nearly 87%, due to lower demand. Brent oil prices decreased from a high of $70.25/Bbl in January 2020, to a low of $9.12/Bbl in April 2020. The average Brent oil prices decreased to $41.96/Bbl in 2020 from $64.28/Bbl in 2019, due to lower prices during majority of the year 2020.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similarly to Brent oil prices, on average decreased to $39.16/Bbl in 2020 from $56.98/Bbl in 2019, and ranged from a high of $63.27/Bbl in January 2020, to a low of $(36.98)/Bbl in April 2020.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.03/mmBtu in 2020, representing a 21% decrease over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a low of $1.33/mmBtu in September 2020, to a high of $3.14/mmBtu in October 2020. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2020 was 3,460 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 7.7%, or 268 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2019.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 30\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, Ukraine was added to the Baker Hughes international rig count. The Company will continue tracking active drilling rigs in the country going forward. Historical periods will not be updated.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International </td> <td>827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 Compared to 2019\nOverall the rig count was 1,349 in 2020, a decrease of 38% as compared to 2019 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America decreased 52% and the international rig count decreased 25% in 2020 compared to 2019, both as a result of lower commodity prices and exploration and production capital expenditure reductions.\nWithin North America, the decrease was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was down 54% on average when compared to the same period last year, and a decrease in the Canadian rig count, which was down 33% on average. Internationally, the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the Latin America region, Africa region and Europe region of 44%, 34% and 24%, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 31\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, goodwill and inventory impairments, separation-related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOur statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which goods\u201d is required to include all sales of tangible products and services\u201d must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between equipment\u201d and product services,\u201d where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to product services\u201d simply as services\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOrders: We recognized orders of $20.7 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, equipment orders were down 27% and service orders were down 20%, compared to 2019.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $23.4 billion and $22.9 billion, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 32\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income for each of our four operating segments is provided below.

2019\nRevenue in 2020 was $20,705 million, a decrease of $3,133 million, or 13%, from 2019. This decrease in revenue was largely a result of decreased activity in OFS, DS and OFE, partially offset by an increase in TPS. OFS decreased $2,749 million, DS decreased $477 million, OFE decreased $77 million, and TPS increased $169 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2020 was $1,504 million, a decrease of $531 million, or 26%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by OFS, which decreased $430 million, OFE, which decreased $36 million and DS, which decreased $150 million, partially offset by TPS, which increased $86 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2020 revenue was $10,140 million, a decrease of $2,749 million from 2019, as a result of decreased activity in North America and international in 2020 compared to 2019, as evidenced by a decline in the corresponding rig counts. North America revenue was $2,802 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,794 million from\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 33\n2019. International revenue was $7,338 million in 2020, a decrease of $955 million from 2019, driven by declines in most regions, primarily in the Middle East and Latin America regions.\nOFS 2020 segment operating income was $487 million, compared to $917 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume, and to a lesser extent, unfavorable business mix, partially offset by our restructuring and productivity initiatives.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2020 revenue was $2,844 million, a decrease of $77 million, or 3%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the services business, mostly driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher volume in the subsea production systems and flexible pipe businesses. The decrease was also impacted by the sale of the Surface Pressure Control Flow business in October 2020.\nOFE 2020 segment operating income was $19 million, compared to $55 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable business mix and to a lesser extent by lower volume.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2020 revenue was $5,705 million, an increase of $169 million, or 3%, from 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher equipment and projects revenue, partially offset by lower services volume as well as business dispositions that occurred in 2019. Equipment revenue in 2020 represented 44% and Service revenue represented 56% of total revenue. Equipment revenue was up 27% year-over-year, and services revenue was down 10% year-over-year, partially due to mobility restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTPS 2020 segment operating income was $805 million, compared to $719 million in 2019. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher cost productivity and to a lesser extent by higher volume, partially offset by unfavorable business mix.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2020 revenue was $2,015 million, a decrease of $477 million, or 19%, from 2019, driven by volume declines across most DS segments, largely driven by lower economic activity related to COVID-19 disruptions.\nDS 2020 segment operating income was $193 million, compared to $343 million in 2019. The decrease in profitability was primarily driven by lower volume.\nCorporate\nIn 2020, corporate expenses were $464 million, an increase of $31 million compared to 2019, primarily from the additional expenses related to the separation from GE.\nInventory Impairment\nIn 2020, we recorded inventory impairments of $246 million, primarily related to our Oilfield Services segment as a result of certain restructuring activities initiated by the Company. There were no inventory impairments recorded in 2019. Charges for inventory impairments are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company's market capitalization declined significantly driven by current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions including the decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices driven by both surplus production and supply. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14,773 million during the first quarter of 2020. There have been no other goodwill impairments during 2020.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 34\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2020, we recognized $1,866 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, compared to $342 million in 2019. These charges primarily relate to the restructuring plan announced in the first quarter of 2020, which include product line rationalization actions, headcount reductions in certain geographical locations, and other initiatives to right-size our operations for anticipated activity levels and market conditions.\nSeparation and Merger Related\nWe recorded $134 million of separation related costs in 2020, a decrease of $50 million from the prior year. Costs in 2020 relate to the ongoing activities for the separation from GE including costs for the build-out of certain information technology infrastructures as a result of the separation.\nOther Non-Operating Income /(Loss), Net\nIn 2020, we recorded $1,040 million of other net non-operating income. Included in this amount is an unrealized gain of $1,417 million related to marking our investment in C3.ai to fair value, partially offset by losses of $353 million for the sale of our Rod Lift Systems business in OFS and the sale of our Surface Pressure Control Flow business in OFE.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2020, we incurred net interest expense of $264 million, an increase of $27 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower interest income.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2020, our income tax expense was $559 million, an increase of $77 million, from $482 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the geographical mix of earnings, partially offset by the benefit of the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the U.S., and includes measures to assist companies, including allowing net operating losses originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to be carried back up to five years. During 2020, we elected to carry back losses to 2014 and accordingly recognized a tax benefit of $117 million and we expect to receive a cash refund of the same amount.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n\u2022Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.\n\u2022Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating concerns across all regions and countries where we do business.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 35\n\u2022Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), administrative service providers, as well as an enhanced risk-based process for classifying channel partners and suppliers.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities.\n\u2022Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.\n\u2022Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as product company and regional compliance committees that meet quarterly.\n\u2022Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.\n\u2022Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements.\n\u2022A compliance program designed to create an Open Reporting Environment\u201d where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages.\n\u2022Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies.\n\u2022Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties.\n\u2022We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire compliance training module for all employees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. Despite the challenging dynamics during 2020, we continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Our liquidity is further supported by a revolving credit facility of $3 billion, and access to both commercial paper and uncommitted lines of credit. At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or our uncommitted lines of credit, and had \u00a3600 million ($801 million) commercial paper outstanding. Our next debt maturity is December 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents includes $44 million and $162 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding cash held on behalf of GE, our U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $1 billion and $0.4 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion of our cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., they will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nWe have a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. The 2019 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 36\nwarranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. We have no borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. During the second quarter of 2020, we established a \u00a3600 million commercial paper facility under which the Bank of England may invest through the COVID Corporate Financing Facility (the Program), which increased our total commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to approximately $3.8 billion. In May 2020, we issued \u00a3600 million of commercial paper under the Program that matures in April 2021 and can be repaid prior to that with no additional cost.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See \"Note 10. Borrowings\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, restructuring and GE separation related costs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operating and financing activities, and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(618) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,045) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,534) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2019\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,304 million and $2,126 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, impairments, loss on sale of businesses, and the unrealized gain on an equity security) and working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets.\nWorking capital generated $216 million of cash in 2020 primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable, as we continue to improve our working capital processes. In 2019,\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 37\nworking capital generated $553 million of cash primarily due to net positive progress collections and receivables in TPS for equipment contracts. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2020 and 2019 are payments of $670 million and $307 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and separation-related costs including the build-out of information technology infrastructure as a result of GE separation activities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $618 million and $1,045 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $974 million and $1,240 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $187 million and $264 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2020, we received proceeds of $187 million primarily from the sale of our Rod Lift Systems and our Surface Pressure Control Flow businesses. In 2019, we received $77 million from the sale of our high-speed reciprocating compression business.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities generated cash of $225 million and used cash of $1,534 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $204 million and $542 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had repayments of our long-term debt of $42 million in 2020 and $570 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by our repayment of certain senior notes.\nIn 2020, we had proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of \u00a3600 million ($737 million at date of issuance). In addition, we had proceeds from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.486% Senior Notes due May 2030. We pay interest on the notes each May and November. In 2019, we had proceeds from the issuance of $525 million aggregate principal amount of 3.138% Senior Notes due November 2029. We pay interest on the notes each May and November. We used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 3.2% Senior Notes due August 2021.\nDuring 2020, we paid aggregate dividends of $488 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHH LLC made a distribution of $256 million to GE. During 2019, we paid aggregate dividends of $395 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHH LLC made a distribution of $350 million to GE. Additionally, in September 2019, BHH LLC repurchased 11.9 million of its units from GE for a cash consideration of $250 million.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2021, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. When necessary, we issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposal of assets, in 2021 are expected to be below 2020 levels. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $350 million to $450 million in 2021.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 38\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>4 - 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and finance lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>3,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including finance lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of BHI. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and finance lease obligations includes $45 million payable to GE and its affiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year.\n(2)Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations.\n(3)Amounts represent the future minimum payments under operating leases with initial terms of one year or more. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n(4)Purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2020 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $601 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 12. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. In 2020, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $39 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding between approximately $30 million to $45 million in 2021. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2021. See \"Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than those discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 39\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, Baker Hughes filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2020, BHH LLC, Baker Hughes Netherlands Funding Company B.V., and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in December 2023.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2020, 16% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the U.S. Other than the U.S., no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2019, 19% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the U.S.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 76% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2020. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nSupply chain finance programs: Under supply chain finance programs, administered by a third party, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. These liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our condensed consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 40\nfollowing are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 7. Contract and Other Deferred Assets\" and \"Note 8. Progress Collections and Deferred Income\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $17 million, $(1) million and $26 million for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2020, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues, of $0.3 billion, represent approximately 2.9% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $11.2 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 41\nassessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 1.66% and 2.34%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 4.20% and 5.48%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and the U.S. GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. This rate is further impacted by the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested as repatriation of these foreign earnings would incur other additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $483 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 42\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality, and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for credit losses totaled $373 million and $323 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements, and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, inventory reserves totaled $421 million and $429 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nFor management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 please refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS).\nWe sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments. Throughout 2020, the industry experienced multiple factors which drove expectations for global oil and gas related spending to be lower than 2019. First, the COVID-19 pandemic lowered global demand for hydrocarbons, as social distancing and travel restrictions were implemented across the world. Second, the lifting of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) supply curtailments in the first quarter of 2020, and the associated increase in production, drove the global excess supply of hydrocarbons higher. In the second quarter of 2020, OPEC+ reached a supply curtailment agreement of up to 10 million barrels per day, which drove expectations for future hydrocarbon supply lower. After significant turmoil during the first half of the year from the industry downturn, oil markets stabilized and demand for oil improved in the second half of the year. Lastly, global gross domestic product (GDP) declined in 2020, as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the health and safety of our employees has continued to be a top priority. We have taken critical steps as a company to reduce the risk of exposure, as well as mitigate the impacts of this pandemic to our employees, contractors and partners. We have adopted remote working where possible. Where on-site operations are required, masks are mandatory and our employees have adopted social distancing. We have worked with our employees to implement other site-specific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure. We are collaborating closely with our customers, suppliers, and vendors to minimize operational disruption. In addition, we have restricted non-essential business travel and have encouraged our employees, customers and partners to collaborate virtually.\nOur goal throughout the downturn in 2020 was to remain disciplined in allocating capital, focus on liquidity and cash preservation, and to preserve our investment grade rating while also maintaining our current dividend payout.\nDuring the year, we took necessary actions to right-size the business for expected activity levels. In the first quarter of 2020, we approved a plan for restructuring and other actions totaling $1.8 billion, which was increased by $0.3 billion as we took further actions during the year to address the continuing industry challenges. Total restructuring and other costs were $2.1 billion in 2020. These charges are primarily related to the costs for reductions in work force, product line exits in certain geographies, and the write down of inventory and intangible assets. These actions took place across the business and our corporate functions. We expect the cash payback of these actions to be less than one year.\nIn addition, during the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly driven by the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred, and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14.8 billion during the first quarter of 2020. There were no other goodwill impairments in 2020.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 28\nIn 2020, we generated revenue of $20.7 billion, compared to $23.8 billion in 2019. The decrease in revenue was driven by declines in all four of our segments primarily due to the industry downturn. Loss before income taxes was $15.2 billion in 2020, and included goodwill impairment charges of $14.8 billion, restructuring and impairment charges of $1.9 billion, inventory impairment charges of $246 million, separation and merger related costs of $134 million, and a gain of $1.4 billion related to our investment in C3.ai recorded in other non-operating income. In 2019, income before income taxes was $0.8 billion, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $342 million, and separation and merger related costs of $184 million.\nThe gain of $1.4 billion related to our C3.ai investment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. We invested in C3.ai when we formed our partnership in June 2019. In December 2020, C3.ai completed its initial public offering, which requires us to mark our investment to fair value. Both our investment and strong partnership with C3.ai demonstrate our commitment for growth in high potential segments as we develop and market new AI solutions for the oil and gas industry.\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. After significant volatility during the first half of 2020, oil markets stabilized during the second half of the year. However, there is still uncertainty in the global economic outlook and impact on oil and gas markets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022North America onshore activity: in 2020, we experienced a significant decline in rig count, as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices. We expect North American onshore activity to improve in 2021, as compared to the second half of 2020.\n\u2022International onshore activity: in 2020, we experienced a decline in rig count, as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices. We expect onshore spending outside of North America to stabilize in early 2021, and see a modest recovery over the second half of the year.\n\u2022Offshore projects: in 2020, we experienced significantly fewer offshore projects reaching positive final investment decisions, due to the economic uncertainty and lower oil and gas prices. In 2021, we expect the offshore markets to stabilize and for the number of tree awards in the market to remain stable or grow modestly compared to 2020 levels.\n\u2022Liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market long term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.\nWe have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including GDP, such as our Digital Solutions segment.\nWe also have segments within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around decarbonization of energy and industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and energy storage. We expect to see continued growth in these segments as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing activity levels in the near term. While governments may change or discontinue incentives for renewable energy additions, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nOver time, we believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 29\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\n\n(1)Energy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n(2)EIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price\n(3)EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nOutside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. After a stable and positive 2019, volatility increased sharply in April 2020 when oil prices dropped nearly 87%, due to lower demand. Brent oil prices decreased from a high of $70.25/Bbl in January 2020, to a low of $9.12/Bbl in April 2020. The average Brent oil prices decreased to $41.96/Bbl in 2020 from $64.28/Bbl in 2019, due to lower prices during majority of the year 2020.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similarly to Brent oil prices, on average decreased to $39.16/Bbl in 2020 from $56.98/Bbl in 2019, and ranged from a high of $63.27/Bbl in January 2020, to a low of $(36.98)/Bbl in April 2020.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.03/mmBtu in 2020, representing a 21% decrease over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a low of $1.33/mmBtu in September 2020, to a high of $3.14/mmBtu in October 2020. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2020 was 3,460 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 7.7%, or 268 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2019.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 30\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, Ukraine was added to the Baker Hughes international rig count. The Company will continue tracking active drilling rigs in the country going forward. Historical periods will not be updated.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\n\n2020 Compared to 2019\nOverall the rig count was 1,349 in 2020, a decrease of 38% as compared to 2019 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America decreased 52% and the international rig count decreased 25% in 2020 compared to 2019, both as a result of lower commodity prices and exploration and production capital expenditure reductions.\nWithin North America, the decrease was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was down 54% on average when compared to the same period last year, and a decrease in the Canadian rig count, which was down 33% on average. Internationally, the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the Latin America region, Africa region and Europe region of 44%, 34% and 24%, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 31\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, goodwill and inventory impairments, separation-related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOur statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which goods\u201d is required to include all sales of tangible products and services\u201d must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between equipment\u201d and product services,\u201d where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to product services\u201d simply as services\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOrders: We recognized orders of $20.7 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, equipment orders were down 27% and service orders were down 20%, compared to 2019.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $23.4 billion and $22.9 billion, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 32\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income for each of our four operating segments is provided below. \n\n(1)Inventory impairments are reported in \"Cost of goods sold\" of the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nFiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2019\nRevenue in 2020 was $20,705 million, a decrease of $3,133 million, or 13%, from 2019. This decrease in revenue was largely a result of decreased activity in OFS, DS and OFE, partially offset by an increase in TPS. OFS decreased $2,749 million, DS decreased $477 million, OFE decreased $77 million, and TPS increased $169 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2020 was $1,504 million, a decrease of $531 million, or 26%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by OFS, which decreased $430 million, OFE, which decreased $36 million and DS, which decreased $150 million, partially offset by TPS, which increased $86 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2020 revenue was $10,140 million, a decrease of $2,749 million from 2019, as a result of decreased activity in North America and international in 2020 compared to 2019, as evidenced by a decline in the corresponding rig counts. North America revenue was $2,802 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,794 million from\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 33\n2019. International revenue was $7,338 million in 2020, a decrease of $955 million from 2019, driven by declines in most regions, primarily in the Middle East and Latin America regions.\nOFS 2020 segment operating income was $487 million, compared to $917 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume, and to a lesser extent, unfavorable business mix, partially offset by our restructuring and productivity initiatives.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2020 revenue was $2,844 million, a decrease of $77 million, or 3%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the services business, mostly driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher volume in the subsea production systems and flexible pipe businesses. The decrease was also impacted by the sale of the Surface Pressure Control Flow business in October 2020.\nOFE 2020 segment operating income was $19 million, compared to $55 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable business mix and to a lesser extent by lower volume.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2020 revenue was $5,705 million, an increase of $169 million, or 3%, from 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher equipment and projects revenue, partially offset by lower services volume as well as business dispositions that occurred in 2019. Equipment revenue in 2020 represented 44% and Service revenue represented 56% of total revenue. Equipment revenue was up 27% year-over-year, and services revenue was down 10% year-over-year, partially due to mobility restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTPS 2020 segment operating income was $805 million, compared to $719 million in 2019. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher cost productivity and to a lesser extent by higher volume, partially offset by unfavorable business mix.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2020 revenue was $2,015 million, a decrease of $477 million, or 19%, from 2019, driven by volume declines across most DS segments, largely driven by lower economic activity related to COVID-19 disruptions.\nDS 2020 segment operating income was $193 million, compared to $343 million in 2019. The decrease in profitability was primarily driven by lower volume.\nCorporate\nIn 2020, corporate expenses were $464 million, an increase of $31 million compared to 2019, primarily from the additional expenses related to the separation from GE.\nInventory Impairment\nIn 2020, we recorded inventory impairments of $246 million, primarily related to our Oilfield Services segment as a result of certain restructuring activities initiated by the Company. There were no inventory impairments recorded in 2019. Charges for inventory impairments are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company's market capitalization declined significantly driven by current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions including the decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices driven by both surplus production and supply. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14,773 million during the first quarter of 2020. There have been no other goodwill impairments during 2020.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 34\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2020, we recognized $1,866 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, compared to $342 million in 2019. These charges primarily relate to the restructuring plan announced in the first quarter of 2020, which include product line rationalization actions, headcount reductions in certain geographical locations, and other initiatives to right-size our operations for anticipated activity levels and market conditions.\nSeparation and Merger Related\nWe recorded $134 million of separation related costs in 2020, a decrease of $50 million from the prior year. Costs in 2020 relate to the ongoing activities for the separation from GE including costs for the build-out of certain information technology infrastructures as a result of the separation.\nOther Non-Operating Income /(Loss), Net\nIn 2020, we recorded $1,040 million of other net non-operating income. Included in this amount is an unrealized gain of $1,417 million related to marking our investment in C3.ai to fair value, partially offset by losses of $353 million for the sale of our Rod Lift Systems business in OFS and the sale of our Surface Pressure Control Flow business in OFE.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2020, we incurred net interest expense of $264 million, an increase of $27 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower interest income.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2020, our income tax expense was $559 million, an increase of $77 million, from $482 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the geographical mix of earnings, partially offset by the benefit of the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the U.S., and includes measures to assist companies, including allowing net operating losses originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to be carried back up to five years. During 2020, we elected to carry back losses to 2014 and accordingly recognized a tax benefit of $117 million and we expect to receive a cash refund of the same amount.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n\u2022Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.\n\u2022Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating concerns across all regions and countries where we do business.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 35\n\u2022Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), administrative service providers, as well as an enhanced risk-based process for classifying channel partners and suppliers.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities.\n\u2022Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.\n\u2022Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as product company and regional compliance committees that meet quarterly.\n\u2022Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.\n\u2022Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements.\n\u2022A compliance program designed to create an Open Reporting Environment\u201d where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages.\n\u2022Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies.\n\u2022Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties.\n\u2022We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire compliance training module for all employees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. Despite the challenging dynamics during 2020, we continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Our liquidity is further supported by a revolving credit facility of $3 billion, and access to both commercial paper and uncommitted lines of credit. At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or our uncommitted lines of credit, and had \u00a3600 million ($801 million) commercial paper outstanding. Our next debt maturity is December 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents includes $44 million and $162 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding cash held on behalf of GE, our U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $1 billion and $0.4 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion of our cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., they will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nWe have a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. The 2019 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 36\nwarranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. We have no borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. During the second quarter of 2020, we established a \u00a3600 million commercial paper facility under which the Bank of England may invest through the COVID Corporate Financing Facility (the Program), which increased our total commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to approximately $3.8 billion. In May 2020, we issued \u00a3600 million of commercial paper under the Program that matures in April 2021 and can be repaid prior to that with no additional cost.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See \"Note 10. Borrowings\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, restructuring and GE separation related costs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operating and financing activities, and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\nFiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2019\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,304 million and $2,126 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, impairments, loss on sale of businesses, and the unrealized gain on an equity security) and working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets.\nWorking capital generated $216 million of cash in 2020 primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable, as we continue to improve our working capital processes. In 2019,\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 37\nworking capital generated $553 million of cash primarily due to net positive progress collections and receivables in TPS for equipment contracts. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2020 and 2019 are payments of $670 million and $307 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and separation-related costs including the build-out of information technology infrastructure as a result of GE separation activities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $618 million and $1,045 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $974 million and $1,240 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $187 million and $264 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2020, we received proceeds of $187 million primarily from the sale of our Rod Lift Systems and our Surface Pressure Control Flow businesses. In 2019, we received $77 million from the sale of our high-speed reciprocating compression business.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities generated cash of $225 million and used cash of $1,534 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $204 million and $542 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had repayments of our long-term debt of $42 million in 2020 and $570 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by our repayment of certain senior notes.\nIn 2020, we had proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of \u00a3600 million ($737 million at date of issuance). In addition, we had proceeds from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.486% Senior Notes due May 2030. We pay interest on the notes each May and November. In 2019, we had proceeds from the issuance of $525 million aggregate principal amount of 3.138% Senior Notes due November 2029. We pay interest on the notes each May and November. We used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 3.2% Senior Notes due August 2021.\nDuring 2020, we paid aggregate dividends of $488 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHH LLC made a distribution of $256 million to GE. During 2019, we paid aggregate dividends of $395 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHH LLC made a distribution of $350 million to GE. Additionally, in September 2019, BHH LLC repurchased 11.9 million of its units from GE for a cash consideration of $250 million.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2021, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. When necessary, we issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposal of assets, in 2021 are expected to be below 2020 levels. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $350 million to $450 million in 2021.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 38\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\n\n(1)Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including finance lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of BHI. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and finance lease obligations includes $45 million payable to GE and its affiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year.\n(2)Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations.\n(3)Amounts represent the future minimum payments under operating leases with initial terms of one year or more. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n(4)Purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2020 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $601 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 12. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. In 2020, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $39 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding between approximately $30 million to $45 million in 2021. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2021. See \"Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than those discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 39\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, Baker Hughes filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2020, BHH LLC, Baker Hughes Netherlands Funding Company B.V., and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in December 2023.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2020, 16% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the U.S. Other than the U.S., no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2019, 19% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the U.S.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 76% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2020. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nSupply chain finance programs: Under supply chain finance programs, administered by a third party, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. These liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our condensed consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 40\nfollowing are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 7. Contract and Other Deferred Assets\" and \"Note 8. Progress Collections and Deferred Income\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $17 million, $(1) million and $26 million for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2020, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues, of $0.3 billion, represent approximately 2.9% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $11.2 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 41\nassessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 1.66% and 2.34%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 4.20% and 5.48%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and the U.S. GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. This rate is further impacted by the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested as repatriation of these foreign earnings would incur other additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $483 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nBaker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10-K | 42\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality, and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for credit losses totaled $373 million and $323 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements, and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, inventory reserves totaled $421 million and $429 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1.

from 2019, driven by declines in all segments due to the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices. Net loss was $15.8 billion, including a $14.8 billion goodwill impairment charge. \n\n- Actions taken to reduce costs and right-size the business in 2020 included $2.1 billion in restructuring and other charges. Cash payback on these actions is expected in less than one year.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion in 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures were $974 million.\n\n- Liquidity remains strong with cash of $4.1 billion. Debt maturities are managed with the next maturity not until 2022. Credit facility of $3 billion is undrawn.\n\n- Outlook for 2021 is for modest recovery but continued volatility and uncertainty, especially related to COVID-19 impacts.\n\n- Critical accounting estimates involve revenue recognition on long-term service agreements, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, pension assumptions, income taxes, and contingencies. \n\nIn summary, Baker Hughes faced a very challenging macro environment in 2020 but took significant actions to reduce costs, maintain a strong liquidity position, and position itself for growth as the industry recovers. Performance is projected to improve modestly in 2021."}
