On a parent-only basis, the Company has had minimal results of operations. The Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, BNB Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and debit card processing programs, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of its non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from its title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects the Bank's net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity.\nYear and Quarterly Highlights\nTable 17: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet income for the 2018 fourth quarter of $13.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet income for the full year 2018 was $39.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $20.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the full year 2017.

The Company is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter. The customer has filed a petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. In January 2019, the Company filed a claim for the loss with its insurance carrier, however, the extent and amount of coverage is not yet certain.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nIn December 2018, in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.50 percent. Information received since the FOMC met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food or energy remain near 2 percent. In support of its goals to foster maximum employment and price stability, in January 2019 the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2.25 to 2.50 percent. The FOMC continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2.00 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.\nInterest rates have been at or near historic lows for an extended period of time. Growth and service strategies have the potential to offset the compression on the net interest margin with volume as the customer base grows through expanding the Bank's footprint, while maintaining and developing existing relationships. Since 2010, the Bank has opened fifteen branches, including one in November 2018 in Melville, New York. The Bank has also grown through acquisitions\nPage -21-\nincluding the June 2015 acquisition of Community National Bank ( CNB\u201d), the February 2014 acquisition of First National Bank of New York ( FNBNY\u201d), and the May 2011 acquisition of Hamptons State Bank ( HSB\u201d). Management will continue to seek opportunities to expand its reach into other contiguous markets by network expansion, or through the addition of professionals with established customer relationships. Recent and pending acquisitions of local competitors may also provide additional growth opportunities.\nThe Bank continues to face challenges associated with ever-increasing regulations and the current low interest rate environment. Over time, additional rate increases should provide some relief to net interest margin compression as new loans are funded and securities are reinvested at higher rates. However, in the short term, the fair value of available for sale securities declines when rates increase, resulting in net unrealized losses and a reduction in stockholders' equity. Strategies for managing for the eventuality of higher rates have a cost. Extending liability maturities or shortening the term of assets increases interest expense and reduces interest income. An additional method for managing in a higher rate environment is to grow stable core deposits, requiring continued investment in people, technology and branches. Over time, these strategies should provide long-term benefits.\nThe Company has established five strategic objectives to achieve its vision: (1) acquire new customers in growth markets; (2) build new sales and marketing disciplines; (3) deepen customer relationships; (4) expand use of automation; and (5) improve talent management. Management believes there remain opportunities to grow its franchise and that continued investments to generate core funding, quality loans and new sources of revenue remain keys to continue creating long-term shareholder value. The ability to attract, retain, train and cultivate employees at all levels of the Company remains significant to meeting corporate objectives. In particular, management is focused on expanding and retaining its loan team as it continues to grow the loan portfolio. The Company has capitalized on opportunities presented by the market and diligently seeks opportunities to grow and strengthen the franchise. The Company recognizes the potential risks of the current economic environment and will monitor the impact of market events as management evaluates loans and investments and considers growth initiatives. Management and the Board have built a solid foundation for growth and the Company is positioned to adapt to anticipated changes in the industry resulting from new regulations and legislative initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of the Company's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. The Company's policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is its most critical accounting policy. This policy is important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations, and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition.\nThe following is a description of this critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nManagement considers the accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses to be the most critical and requires complex management judgment. The judgments made regarding the allowance for loan losses can have a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. The allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances. The Bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans, repayment patterns, probable incurred losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and various types of concentrations of credit. Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to the allowance.\nPage -22-\nIndividual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) No. 310, Receivables\u201d. Such valuation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectability in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured, considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell, if any, or the present value of expected future cash flows, or the loan's observable market value. Any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan. Pursuant to the Company's policy, loan losses must be charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectable. Assumptions and judgments by management, in conjunction with outside sources, are used to determine whether full collectability of a loan is not reasonably assured. These assumptions and judgments are also used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan's observable market value. Individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired. Individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments. The results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses.\nLoan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with the Bank's lending activities, but which, unlike individual allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. Pool evaluations are broken down into loans with homogenous characteristics by loan type and include commercial real estate mortgages, owner and non-owner occupied; multi-family mortgage loans; residential real estate mortgages, home equity loans; commercial, industrial and agricultural loans, secured and unsecured; real estate construction and land loans; and consumer loans. Management considers a variety of factors in determining the adequacy of the valuation allowance and has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses in each pool of loans. Management considers the Bank's charge-off history along with the growth in the portfolio as well as the Bank's credit administration and asset management philosophies and procedures when determining the allowances for each pool. In addition, management evaluates and considers credit risk ratings, which includes management's evaluation of: cash flow, collateral, guarantor support, financial disclosures, industry trends and strength of borrowers' management, the impact that economic and market conditions may have on the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Finally, management evaluates and considers the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data. These evaluations are inherently subjective because, even though they are based on objective data, it is management's interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance. If the evaluations prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses.\nFor Purchased Credit Impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans, a valuation allowance is established when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all the cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition. A specific allowance is established when subsequent evaluations of expected cash flows from PCI loans reflect a decrease in those estimates. The allowance established represents the excess of the recorded investment in those loans over the present value of the currently estimated future cash flow, discounted at the last effective accounting yield.\nThe Bank uses assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and probable losses in the loan portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, management's judgment and experience play a key role in recording the allowance estimates. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by provisions charged to earnings. Furthermore, an improvement in the expected cash flows related to PCI loans would result in a reduction of the required specific allowance with a corresponding credit to the provision.\nThe Credit Risk Management Committee ( CRMC\u201d) is comprised of Bank management. The adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly, with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the CRMC, based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Each quarter, members of the CRMC meet with the Credit Risk Committee of the Board to review credit risk trends and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Based on the CRMC's review of the classified loans, delinquency and charge-off trends, and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the\nPage -23-\nallowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination.\nFor additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $39.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $20.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $35.5 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income increased $18.7 million, or 91.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and net income for 2017 decreased $15.0 million, or 42.1%, as compared to 2016. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 include: (i) a $9.6 million, or 7.6%, increase in net interest income; (ii) a $12.3 million, or 87.2%, decrease in the provision for loan losses; (iii) a $6.5 million, or 36.1%, decrease in total non-interest income; (iv) a $6.5 million, or 7.0%, increase in total non-interest expense; and (v) a $9.8 million, or 51.8%, decrease in income tax expense. The effective income tax rate was 18.9% for 2018 compared to 48.0% for 2017. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 include: (i) a $6.3 million, or 5.2%, increase in net interest income; (ii) an $8.5 million increase in the provision for loan losses; (iii) a $2.1 million, or 12.8%, increase in total non-interest income; and (iv) a $14.6 million, or 19.0%, increase in total non-interest expense. The effective income tax rate was 48.0% for 2017 compared to 34.6% for 2016.\nThe weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 19.5 million, 19.4 million and 17.9 million, respectively. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were higher for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016 due in part to the $50 million common stock offering in November 2016.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the primary contributor to earnings, represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expenses on interest- bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company's average consolidated balance sheets and its consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for those periods on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from daily average balances and include non-accrual loans. The yields and costs include fees and costs, which are considered adjustments to yields. Interest on non-accrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income. The Tax Act lowered the U.S, federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company's tax-equivalent adjustment to interest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the lower federal statutory tax rate in 2018. For purposes of this table, the average balances for investments in debt and equity securities exclude unrealized appreciation/depreciation due to the application of FASB ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d\nTable 26: <table></table>\nPage -24-\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net changes. For purposes of this table, changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate. Due to the numerous simultaneous\nPage -25-\nvolume and rate changes during the periods analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In addition, average interest-earning assets include non-accrual loans.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

and $120.9 million in 2016. The increase in net interest income was $9.6 million, or 7.6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 and $6.3 million, or 5.2%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Average net interest-earning assets increased $147.2 million to $1.4 billion for the full year 2018 compared to $1.3 billion for the full year 2017 and increased $128.8 million to $1.3 billion for the full year 2017 compared to $1.2 billion for the full year 2016. The increase in average net interest-earning assets in 2018 reflects organic growth in loans and a decrease in average borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities and an increase in average deposits. The increase in average net interest-earning assets in 2017 reflects organic growth in loans and an increase in average investment securities, partially offset by increases in average deposits and average borrowings. Tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.33% in 2018 compared to 3.34% in 2017 and 3.48% in 2016. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest margin for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects higher overall funding costs due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2018 and 2017, partially offset by a higher average yield on interest-earning assets primarily due to loan portfolio growth, and a higher average yield on investment securities. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 reflects the higher overall funding costs due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in January 2017.\nTotal interest income increased to $169.0 million in 2018 compared to $149.8 million in 2017 as average interest-earning assets increased $283.8 million, or 7.4%, to $4.1 billion in 2018 compared to $3.8 billion in 2017. Interest income increased to $149.8 million in 2017 compared to $137.7 million in 2016, as average interest-earning assets increased $338.6 million to $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in 2016. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2018 reflects organic growth in loans, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2017 reflects organic growth in loans and an increase in average investment securities. The tax-equivalent average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.11% in 2018, 3.93% in 2017 and 3.96% in 2016.\nInterest income on loans increased to $144.4 million in 2018 compared to $126.4 million in 2017 and $116.7 million in 2016, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans. For the year ended December 31, 2018, average loans grew by $393.5 million, or 14.2%, to $3.2 billion as compared to $2.8 billion in\nPage -26-\n2017, and increased $279.7 million, or 11.2%, in 2017 as compared to $2.5 billion in 2016. The increases in average loans were the result of the organic growth in commercial real estate mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and real estate construction and land loans. The tax-equivalent average yield on loans was 4.56% in 2018, 4.57% in 2017 and 4.69% in 2016. The Company remains committed to growing loans with prudent underwriting, sensible pricing and limited credit and extension risk.\nInterest income on investment securities increased to $23.5 million in 2018 from $23.1 million in 2017 and $20.8 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a higher average yield on investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in the average investment securities. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 reflects a higher average yield on investment securities and growth in the investment securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, average total investment securities decreased $137.3 million, or 13.1%, to $910.7 million as compared to $1.0 billion in 2017, and increased $63.4 million in 2017 compared to $984.6 million in 2016. Interest income on investment securities included net amortization of premiums on securities of $4.0 million in 2018, compared to $6.4 million in 2017 and $6.5 million in 2016.\nTotal interest expense increased to $32.2 million in 2018, compared to $22.7 million in 2017 and $16.8 million in 2016. The increase in total interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was a result of an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. The increase in total interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was a result of an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.20% in 2018, 0.89% in 2017, and 0.72% in 2016. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher overall funding costs, due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2018, 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in January 2017. Since the Company's interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, in a rising rate environment the cost of funds increases faster than the yields on assets. The Company began extending the terms of certain matured borrowings by utilizing interest rate swap agreements at the end of the 2017 first quarter in anticipation of further Fed Funds rate increases. Additionally, a large percentage of deposits in money market accounts reprice at short-term market rates making the balance sheet more liability sensitive. The Bank continues its prudent management of deposit pricing. Average total interest-bearing liabilities were $2.7 billion in 2018, compared to $2.6 billion in 2017 and $2.3 billion in 2016. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in both average borrowings and average deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, average total deposits increased by $412.7 million to $3.5 billion as compared to $3.1 billion in 2017, and increased by $192.6 million, or 6.6%, in 2017 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2016. The increase in average total deposits reflects higher average savings, NOW and money market deposits, average demand deposits, and average certificates of deposit. The average balances in savings, NOW and money market accounts increased $205.0 million, or 11.9%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $132.4 million, or 8.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The average cost of savings, NOW and money market accounts was 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 0.46% in 2017 and 0.33% in 2016. Average demand deposits increased $136.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $64.0 million, or 5.8%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Average balances in certificates of deposit increased $71.7 million, or 32.6%, to $291.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $3.8 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The cost of average certificates of deposit increased to 1.65% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 1.17% in 2017 and 0.72% in 2016. Average public fund deposits comprised 15.4% of total average deposits during 2018, compared to 16.0% in 2017 and 17.1% in 2016.\nAverage federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $62.9 million, or 47.5%, to $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $132.5 million for 2017, and decreased $29.6 million, or 18.3%, in 2017 compared to $162.1 million for 2016. Average FHLB advances decreased $76.6 million, or 19.1%, to $324.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $401.3 million in 2017 and increased $125.7 million in 2017 compared to $275.6 million in 2016. Average subordinated debentures increased $140 thousand, or 0.2%, to $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $78.6 million for 2017, and increased $139 thousand, or 0.2%, compared to $78.4 million in 2016. The junior subordinated debentures were redeemed in January 2017.\nPage -27-\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Bank's principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs. The interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, the Bank's relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.\nBased on the Company's continuing review of the overall loan portfolio, the current asset quality of the portfolio, the growth in the loan portfolio and the net charge-offs, a provision for loan losses of $1.8 million was recorded in 2018, as compared to $14.1 million in 2017 and $5.6 million in 2016. Net charge-offs were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The charge-offs in 2018 resulted from the charge-off of one loan which was fully reserved for and partial charge-offs recognized on eleven taxi medallion loans attributable to payoff settlements accepted by the Bank. The charge-offs in 2017 resulted primarily from the charge-off of loans and specific reserves associated with two specific relationships. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans was 1,119%, 456% and 2,087% at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses totaled $31.4 million at December 31, 2018, $31.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $25.9 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of total loans was 0.96%, 1.02% and 1.00% at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Management continues to carefully monitor the loan portfolio as well as real estate trends in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the New York City boroughs.\nLoans totaling $87.9 million or 2.7%, of total loans at December 31, 2018 were categorized as classified loans compared to $85.3 million or 2.8%, at December 31, 2017 and $84.3 million, or 3.2%, at December 31, 2016. Classified loans include loans with credit quality indicators with the internally assigned grades of special mention, substandard and doubtful. These loans are categorized as classified loans as management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms. These loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed at least quarterly.\nAt December 31, 2018, $35.0 million of these classified loans were commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans. Of the $35.0 million of CRE loans, $33.5 million were current and $1.5 million were past due. At December 31, 2018, $12.4 million of classified loans were residential real estate loans with $11.0 million current and $1.4 million past due. Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represented $39.7 million of classified loans, with $39.1 million current and $0.6 million past due. Taxi medallion loans represented $16.2 million of the classified commercial, industrial and agricultural loans at December 31, 2018. All of the Bank's taxi medallion loans are collateralized by New York City medallions and have personal guarantees. All taxi medallion loans were current as of December 31, 2018. No new originations of taxi medallion loans are currently planned and management expects these balances to continue to decline through amortization and pay-offs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, nine taxi medallion loans totaling $6.9 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off. Four were paid in full and the Bank accepted settlements on the other five which resulted in partial charge-offs. In January 2019, seven additional taxi medallion loans, totaling $6.2 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off under Bank accepted settlements. The charge-offs related to these settlements were recognized in the 2018 fourth quarter. Taxi medallion loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, there was $0.3 million of classified real estate construction and land loans which were current and $0.4 million of classified multi-family loans which were current.\nCRE loans, including multi-family loans, represented $2.0 billion, or 59.9%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 compared to $1.9 billion, or 61.0%, at December 31, 2017 and $1.5 billion, or 59.2%, at December 31, 2016. The Bank's underwriting standards for CRE loans require an evaluation of the cash flow of the property, the overall cash flow of the borrower and related guarantors as well as the value of the real estate securing the loan. In addition, the Bank's underwriting standards for CRE loans are consistent with regulatory requirements with original loan to value ratios generally less than or equal to 75%. The Bank considers charge-off history, delinquency trends, cash flow analysis, and the impact of the local economy on commercial real estate values when evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nPage -28-\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had individually impaired loans as defined by FASB ASC No. 310, Receivables\u201d of $19.4 million and $22.5 million, respectively. For a loan to be considered impaired, management determines after review whether it is probable that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management applies its normal loan review procedures in making these judgments. Impaired loans include individually classified non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructuring loans ( TDRs\u201d) and at December 31, 2018 included $2.7 million in other impaired performing loans related to three taxi medallion loans which paid off in January 2019. For impaired loans, the Bank evaluates the impairment of the loan in accordance with FASB ASC 310-10-35-22. Impairment is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. For loans that are collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell is used to determine the fair value of the loan. The fair value of the collateral is determined based on recent appraised values. The fair value of the collateral less costs to sell or present value of expected cash flows is compared to the carrying value to determine if any write-down or specific loan loss allowance allocation is required. The decrease in impaired loans from December 31, 2017 was attributable to the payoff of certain TDRs, coupled with a decrease in non-accrual loans due to the charge-off of one loan and sales and payoffs, partially offset by new TDRs during the year ended December 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank modified certain loans as TDRs totaling $9.2 million.\nNon-accrual loans were $2.8 million, or 0.09%, of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million, or 0.22%, of total loans at December 31, 2017. TDRs represent $133 thousand of the non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018 and $5 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's other real estate owned at December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million, consisting of one property, compared to none at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth changes in the allowance for loan losses:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

2017 and increased by $2.1 million, or 12.8%, to $18.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.0 million in 2016. The decrease in total non-interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a $7.9 million net securities loss related to the balance sheet restructure in the second quarter 2018, and a decrease in title fee income, partially offset by increases in service charges and other fees, other operating income and gain on sale of Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) loans. The increase in total non-interest income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in service charges and other fees, gain on sale of SBA loans, title fee income, other operating income, BOLI income, partially offset by a decrease in net securities gains.\nNet securities losses of $7.9 million were recognized in 2018 compared to net securities gains of $38 thousand in 2017 and $0.4 million in 2016. The net securities losses in 2018 were attributable to the sale of $240.3 million of securities related to balance sheet restructure in the second quarter 2018. The net securities gains in 2016 were primarily attributable to the sale of $235.7 million of lower yielding securities in the 2016 second quarter as part of a deleveraging strategy by the Company.\nOther operating income increased $0.8 million to $3.5 million in 2018, compared to $2.7 million in 2017, primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in net gain of sale of loans, and increased $0.4 million to $2.7 million in 2017 compared to $2.3 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in loan swap fee income of $0.9 million.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense increased $6.5 million, or 7.0%, to $98.2 million in 2018 from $91.7 million in 2017, and increased $14.6 million, or 19.0%, to $91.7 million in 2017 compared to $77.1 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to an $8.9 million net fraud loss, higher salaries and benefits, professional services, office relocation costs, technology and communications expenses, and FDIC assessments, partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment, and marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to restructuring costs related to branch restructuring and charter conversion, and higher salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, technology and communications, marketing and advertising, and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower amortization of other intangible assets, professional services and FDIC assessments. The reversal of accrued acquisition costs in 2016 is due to the reversal of pending merger related liabilities recorded at the acquisition date, which have since been settled.\nThe Company incurred an $8.9 million pre-tax net fraud loss charge in 2018 related to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at the Bank. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.9 million to $50.5 million in 2018, compared to $46.6 million 2017 and increased $5.0 million from $41.6 million in 2016. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to additional staff related to business development, and risk management. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to additional staff related to new branches, business development, and risk management. Occupancy and equipment decreased $0.8\nPage -30-\nmillion to $13.2 million in 2018 compared to $14.0 million in 2017 and increased $1.2 million from $12.8 million in 2016. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expense in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the cost savings related to the execution of the Company's branch rationalization strategy. Technology and communications increased $0.7 million to $6.5 million in 2018 compared to $5.8 million in 2017 and increased $0.9 million from $4.9 million in 2016. Marketing and advertising decreased $0.1 million to $4.6 million in 2018 compared to $4.7 million in 2017 and increased $0.7 million from $4.0 million in 2016. Professional services increased $0.9 million to $4.0 million in 2018 compared to $3.1 million in 2017 and decreased $0.5 million from $3.6 million in 2016. FDIC assessments were $1.7 million in 2018, $1.3 million in 2017, and $1.6 million in 2016. The Company recorded amortization of other intangible assets of $0.9 million in 2018, $1.0 million in 2017, $2.6 million in 2016, primarily related to the CNB and FNBNY acquisitions. Other operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in 2018, $7.1 million in 2017, and $6.8 million in 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $9.8 million, or 51.8%, to $9.1 million in 2018 compared to $18.9 million in 2017, and increased $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from $18.8 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 18.9% in 2018, 48.0% in 2017 and 34.6% in 2016. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a lower effective tax rate in 2018 due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher income before income taxes in 2018. Income tax expense in 2017 included a $7.6 million charge to write-down the Company's deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter 2017. The Company estimates it will record income tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 22% in 2019.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $270.7 million, or 6.1%, to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased $200.6 million to $295.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, including proceeds from a large deposit made in December 2018 which was not readily deployed into securities or loans. Total securities decreased $111.1 million to $865.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, which includes the Company's sale of $238.3 million of securities in 2018. Total loans held for investment, net, increased $173.1 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, which includes the Company's sale of $39.8 million of commercial real estate and multi-family loans in 2018. The ability to grow the loan portfolio, while minimizing interest rate risk sensitivity and maintaining credit quality, remains a strong focus of management.\nTotal liabilities increased $246.1 million, or 6.2%, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $551.9 million, or 16.5%, to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Demand deposits increased $109.9 million, or 8.2%, to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Savings, NOW and money market deposits increased $334.8 million, or 18.9%, to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit increased $107.1 million, or 48.2%, to $329.5 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The deposit growth in 2018 reflects the Company's strategy to fund loan growth primarily with deposits. Federal funds purchased were zero at December 31, 2018 compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2017. FHLB advances decreased $260.9 million, or 52.0%, to $240.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in wholesale borrowings in 2018 reflects the Company's strategy to pay down its higher cost borrowings.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $24.6 million, or 5.7%, to $453.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to net income of $39.2 million, share based compensation of $3.5 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( DRP\u201d) of $1.0 million, partially offset by $18.3 million in dividends.\nLoans\nDuring 2018, the Company continued to experience growth in most loan portfolios. The concentration of loans in the Company's primary market areas may increase risk. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Bank's principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York\nPage -31-\nCity boroughs. The local economic conditions on Long Island have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations, the quality of loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans. A considerable decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the Company's control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of the Company's operations. Additionally, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings.\nThe interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, the Bank's relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the FRB, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.\nThe Bank targets its business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to the underwriting of loans, there are certain risks, including the risk of non-payment that are associated with each type of loan that the Bank markets. Approximately 79.6% of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was secured by real estate. Commercial real estate loans represented 42.0% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Multi-family mortgage loans represented 17.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Residential real estate mortgage loans represented 15.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio, including home equity lines of credit representing 2.2% and residential mortgages representing 13.7% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Real estate construction and land loans represented 3.8% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties. Home equity loans represent loans originated in the Bank's geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of 75% or less. The Bank's residential mortgage portfolio included approximately $54.9 million in interest only mortgages at December 31, 2018. The underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization. The Bank uses conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate itself from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on Long Island and the New York City boroughs that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans.\nThe remainder of the loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and consumer loans, which represented 20.4% of the Bank's loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018. The commercial loans are made to businesses and include term loans, lines of credit, senior secured loans to corporations, equipment financing and taxi medallion loans. The primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business, the experience and quality of the borrowers' management, the business climate, and the impact of economic factors. The primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower, such as the risk of a borrower's unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower's other existing indebtedness, and the value of the collateral securing the loan if the Bank must take possession of the collateral.\nThe Bank's policy for charging off loans is a multi-step process. A loan is considered a potential charge-off when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of 90, 120 or 180 days, depending upon the loan type, as of the end of the prior month. In addition to delinquency criteria, other triggering events may include, but are not limited to, notice of bankruptcy by the borrower or guarantor, death of the borrower, and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral. These loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the CRMC. A loan is charged off when a loss is reasonably assured. The recovery of charged-off balances is actively pursued until the potential for recovery has been exhausted, or until the expense of collection does not justify the recovery efforts.\nTotal loans grew $173.1 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2017 with commercial real mortgage loans being the largest contributor of the growth. Commercial real estate mortgage loans increased $79.7 million, or 6.2%, during 2018. Residential real estate mortgage loans increased $55.5 million, or 12.0%, during 2018. Commercial, industrial and agricultural loans increased $29.7 million, or 4.8%, in 2018. Real estate construction and land loans increased $15.6 million, or 14.5%, in 2018. Multi-family mortgage loans and\nPage -32-\ninstallment/consumer loans both decreased slightly during 2018. Fixed rate loans represented 23.9% and 24.3% of total loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the major classifications of loans at the dates

million at December 31, 2018 and $35.3 million at December 31, 2017. The available for sale portfolio decreased $79.0 million to $680.9 million from $759.9 million at December 31, 2017. Securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors. During 2018, the Company sold $238.3 million of securities available for sale compared to $52.4 million in 2017. The decrease in securities available for sale is primarily the result of a $93.4 million decrease in residential mortgage-backed securities, a $46.3 million decrease in state and municipal obligations, and a $27.8 million decrease in GSE securities, partially offset by a $50.4 million increase in residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and a $41.9 million increase in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations. Securities held to maturity decreased $20.7 million to $160.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $180.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in securities held to maturity is primarily the result of a $1.9 million decrease in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations, a $6.0 million decrease in residential collateralized mortgage obligations, a $7.2 million decrease in state and municipal obligations, and a $3.9 million decrease in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Fixed rate securities\nPage -34-\nrepresented 88.4% of total available for sale and held to maturity securities at December 31, 2018 compared to 87.5% at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the fair values, amortized costs, contractual maturities and approximate weighted average yields of the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios at December 31, 2018. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Individual, partnership and corporate ( core deposits\u201d) account balances increased $430.8 million and public funds and brokered deposits increased $121.1 million. The growth in deposits is attributable to increases in savings, NOW and money market deposits of $334.8 million, or 18.9%, to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase in demand deposits of $109.9 million, or 8.2%, to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018, and an increase in certificates of deposit of $107.1 million,\nPage -35-\nor 48.2%, to $329.5 million at December 31, 2018.

Liquidity management addresses the ability of the Company to meet financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments and deposit withdrawals, either on demand or on contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise.\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and dividend capabilities from the Bank. Cash available for distribution of dividends to shareholders of the Company is primarily derived from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. During 2018, the Bank paid $15.0 million in cash dividends to the Company. Prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the Bank's net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. As of January 1, 2019, the Bank had $51.4 million of retained net income available for dividends to the Company. In the event that the Company subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs. The Company did not make any capital contributions to the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Bank's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and investment securities principal repayments and maturities, lines of credit with other financial institutions including the FHLB and FRB, growth in core deposits and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered deposits. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing securities and short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit flows, loans, and asset and liability management objectives. Historically, the Bank has relied on its deposit base, drawn through its full-service branches that serve its market area and local municipal deposits, as its principal source of funding. The Bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers, while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its strategies.\nThe Bank's Asset/Liability and Funds Management Policy allows for wholesale borrowings of up to 25% of total assets. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had aggregate lines of credit of $373.0 million with unaffiliated correspondent banks to provide short-term credit for liquidity requirements. Of these aggregate lines of credit, $353.0 million is available on an unsecured basis. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had no overnight borrowings outstanding under these lines. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $50.0 million in overnight borrowings outstanding. The Bank also has the ability, as a member of the FHLB system, to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the Bank. The Bank also has a master repurchase agreement with the FHLB, which increases its borrowing capacity. As of December\nPage -36-\n31, 2018, the Bank had no FHLB overnight borrowings outstanding and $240.4 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $185.0 million in FHLB overnight borrowings and $316.4 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $0.5 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $0.9 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. In addition, the Bank has approved broker relationships for the purpose of issuing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $101.6 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposit and $150.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $44.9 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposits and $163.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts.\nLiquidity policies are established by senior management and reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors at least annually. Management continually monitors the liquidity position and believes that sufficient liquidity exists to meet all of the Company's operating requirements. The Bank's liquidity levels are affected by the use of short-term and wholesale borrowings and the amount of public funds in the deposit mix. Excess short-term liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sold or in an interest-earning account at the FRB.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations.\nThe following table presents contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2018:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFour to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOver Five\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,687\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB advances and repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n329,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n252,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n699,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n500,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n99,065\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSome financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $65.8 million in outstanding loan commitments and $636.8 million in outstanding commitments for various lines of credit including unused overdraft lines. The Company also had $26.0 million of standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2018. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' equity increased to $453.8 million at December 31, 2018 from $429.2 million at December 31, 2017 as a result of undistributed net income, the shares of common stock issued under the DRP, and the stock-based compensation plan; partially offset by the declaration of dividends, and the net change in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, pension benefits, and cash flow hedges. The ratio of average stockholders' equity to average total assets was 10.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 10.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's capital strength is paralleled by the solid capital position of the Bank, as reflected in the excess of its regulatory capital ratios over the risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels required for classification as a well capitalized\u201d institution by the FDIC (see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Since 2013, the Company\nPage -37-\nhas actively managed its capital position in response to its growth. During this period, the Company has raised $261.2 million in capital through the following initiatives:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOn October 8, 2013, the Company completed a public offering with net proceeds of $37.6 million in capital from the sale of 1,926,250 shares of common stock.

The Company also utilizes cash dividends and stock repurchases to manage capital levels. In 2018, the Company declared four quarterly cash dividends totaling $18.3 million compared to four quarterly cash dividends of $18.2 million in 2017. The dividend payout ratios for 2018 and 2017 were 46.76% and 88.80%, respectively. The Company continues its trend of uninterrupted dividends. In March 2006, the Company approved its stock repurchase plan allowing the repurchase of up to 5% of its then current outstanding shares, 309,000 shares. The Company considers opportunities for stock repurchases carefully. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2018 and 2017. In February 2019, the Company announced the approval of a repurchase program for up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock, replacing the previous plan. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase plan.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or in the same magnitude, as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, which are\nPage -38-\nbeyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the FRB.\nImpact of Prospective Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

On a parent-only basis, the Company has had minimal results of operations. The Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, BNB Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and debit card processing programs, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of its non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from its title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects the Bank's net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity.\nYear and Quarterly Highlights\n \u00b7 Net income for the 2018 fourth quarter of $13.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. \n \u00b7 Net income for the full year 2018 was $39.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $20.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the full year 2017. Inclusive of: \nPage -20-\noPre-tax charge of $8.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share after tax, related to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at BNB in the 2018 third quarter.\noPre-tax net securities losses of $7.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share after tax, related to the Company's balance sheet restructure in the 2018 second quarter.\noPre-tax charge of $0.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share after tax, related to the Company's office relocation costs in the 2018 fourth quarter.\n \u00b7 Net interest income increased to $136.8 million for 2018, compared to $127.2 million in 2017. \n \u00b7 Tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.33% for 2018 and 3.34% in 2017. \n \u00b7 Total assets of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $270.7 million, or 6.1%, over December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 Total loans held for investment at December 31, 2018 of $3.3 billion, an increase of $173.1 million, or 5.6%, over December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 Total deposits of $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $551.9 million, or 16.5%, over December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 Allowance for loan losses was 0.96% of loans as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.02% at December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 A cash dividend of $0.23 per share was declared and paid in January 2019 for the fourth quarter. \nSignificant Recent Events\nNet Fraud Loss\nThe Company incurred a pre-tax charge, net of recovery, of $8.9 million in 2018 relating to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at the Bank. The Company is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter. The customer has filed a petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. In January 2019, the Company filed a claim for the loss with its insurance carrier, however, the extent and amount of coverage is not yet certain.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nIn December 2018, in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.50 percent. Information received since the FOMC met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food or energy remain near 2 percent. In support of its goals to foster maximum employment and price stability, in January 2019 the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2.25 to 2.50 percent. The FOMC continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2.00 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.\nInterest rates have been at or near historic lows for an extended period of time. Growth and service strategies have the potential to offset the compression on the net interest margin with volume as the customer base grows through expanding the Bank's footprint, while maintaining and developing existing relationships. Since 2010, the Bank has opened fifteen branches, including one in November 2018 in Melville, New York. The Bank has also grown through acquisitions\nPage -21-\nincluding the June 2015 acquisition of Community National Bank ( CNB\u201d), the February 2014 acquisition of First National Bank of New York ( FNBNY\u201d), and the May 2011 acquisition of Hamptons State Bank ( HSB\u201d). Management will continue to seek opportunities to expand its reach into other contiguous markets by network expansion, or through the addition of professionals with established customer relationships. Recent and pending acquisitions of local competitors may also provide additional growth opportunities.\nThe Bank continues to face challenges associated with ever-increasing regulations and the current low interest rate environment. Over time, additional rate increases should provide some relief to net interest margin compression as new loans are funded and securities are reinvested at higher rates. However, in the short term, the fair value of available for sale securities declines when rates increase, resulting in net unrealized losses and a reduction in stockholders' equity. Strategies for managing for the eventuality of higher rates have a cost. Extending liability maturities or shortening the term of assets increases interest expense and reduces interest income. An additional method for managing in a higher rate environment is to grow stable core deposits, requiring continued investment in people, technology and branches. Over time, these strategies should provide long-term benefits.\nThe Company has established five strategic objectives to achieve its vision: (1) acquire new customers in growth markets; (2) build new sales and marketing disciplines; (3) deepen customer relationships; (4) expand use of automation; and (5) improve talent management. Management believes there remain opportunities to grow its franchise and that continued investments to generate core funding, quality loans and new sources of revenue remain keys to continue creating long-term shareholder value. The ability to attract, retain, train and cultivate employees at all levels of the Company remains significant to meeting corporate objectives. In particular, management is focused on expanding and retaining its loan team as it continues to grow the loan portfolio. The Company has capitalized on opportunities presented by the market and diligently seeks opportunities to grow and strengthen the franchise. The Company recognizes the potential risks of the current economic environment and will monitor the impact of market events as management evaluates loans and investments and considers growth initiatives. Management and the Board have built a solid foundation for growth and the Company is positioned to adapt to anticipated changes in the industry resulting from new regulations and legislative initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of the Company's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. The Company's policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is its most critical accounting policy. This policy is important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations, and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition.\nThe following is a description of this critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nManagement considers the accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses to be the most critical and requires complex management judgment. The judgments made regarding the allowance for loan losses can have a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. The allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances. The Bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans, repayment patterns, probable incurred losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and various types of concentrations of credit. Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to the allowance.\nPage -22-\nIndividual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) No. 310, Receivables\u201d. Such valuation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectability in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured, considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell, if any, or the present value of expected future cash flows, or the loan's observable market value. Any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan. Pursuant to the Company's policy, loan losses must be charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectable. Assumptions and judgments by management, in conjunction with outside sources, are used to determine whether full collectability of a loan is not reasonably assured. These assumptions and judgments are also used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan's observable market value. Individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired. Individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments. The results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses.\nLoan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with the Bank's lending activities, but which, unlike individual allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. Pool evaluations are broken down into loans with homogenous characteristics by loan type and include commercial real estate mortgages, owner and non-owner occupied; multi-family mortgage loans; residential real estate mortgages, home equity loans; commercial, industrial and agricultural loans, secured and unsecured; real estate construction and land loans; and consumer loans. Management considers a variety of factors in determining the adequacy of the valuation allowance and has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses in each pool of loans. Management considers the Bank's charge-off history along with the growth in the portfolio as well as the Bank's credit administration and asset management philosophies and procedures when determining the allowances for each pool. In addition, management evaluates and considers credit risk ratings, which includes management's evaluation of: cash flow, collateral, guarantor support, financial disclosures, industry trends and strength of borrowers' management, the impact that economic and market conditions may have on the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Finally, management evaluates and considers the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data. These evaluations are inherently subjective because, even though they are based on objective data, it is management's interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance. If the evaluations prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses.\nFor Purchased Credit Impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans, a valuation allowance is established when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all the cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition. A specific allowance is established when subsequent evaluations of expected cash flows from PCI loans reflect a decrease in those estimates. The allowance established represents the excess of the recorded investment in those loans over the present value of the currently estimated future cash flow, discounted at the last effective accounting yield.\nThe Bank uses assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and probable losses in the loan portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, management's judgment and experience play a key role in recording the allowance estimates. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by provisions charged to earnings. Furthermore, an improvement in the expected cash flows related to PCI loans would result in a reduction of the required specific allowance with a corresponding credit to the provision.\nThe Credit Risk Management Committee ( CRMC\u201d) is comprised of Bank management. The adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly, with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the CRMC, based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Each quarter, members of the CRMC meet with the Credit Risk Committee of the Board to review credit risk trends and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Based on the CRMC's review of the classified loans, delinquency and charge-off trends, and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the\nPage -23-\nallowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination.\nFor additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $39.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $20.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $35.5 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income increased $18.7 million, or 91.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and net income for 2017 decreased $15.0 million, or 42.1%, as compared to 2016. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 include: (i) a $9.6 million, or 7.6%, increase in net interest income; (ii) a $12.3 million, or 87.2%, decrease in the provision for loan losses; (iii) a $6.5 million, or 36.1%, decrease in total non-interest income; (iv) a $6.5 million, or 7.0%, increase in total non-interest expense; and (v) a $9.8 million, or 51.8%, decrease in income tax expense. The effective income tax rate was 18.9% for 2018 compared to 48.0% for 2017. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 include: (i) a $6.3 million, or 5.2%, increase in net interest income; (ii) an $8.5 million increase in the provision for loan losses; (iii) a $2.1 million, or 12.8%, increase in total non-interest income; and (iv) a $14.6 million, or 19.0%, increase in total non-interest expense. The effective income tax rate was 48.0% for 2017 compared to 34.6% for 2016.\nThe weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 19.5 million, 19.4 million and 17.9 million, respectively. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were higher for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016 due in part to the $50 million common stock offering in November 2016.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the primary contributor to earnings, represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expenses on interest- bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company's average consolidated balance sheets and its consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for those periods on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from daily average balances and include non-accrual loans. The yields and costs include fees and costs, which are considered adjustments to yields. Interest on non-accrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income. The Tax Act lowered the U.S, federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company's tax-equivalent adjustment to interest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the lower federal statutory tax rate in 2018. For purposes of this table, the average balances for investments in debt and equity securities exclude unrealized appreciation/depreciation due to the application of FASB ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d\n \nPage -24-\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net changes. For purposes of this table, changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate. Due to the numerous simultaneous\nPage -25-\nvolume and rate changes during the periods analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In addition, average interest-earning assets include non-accrual loans.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, 35% and 35% for the years ended December 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nNet interest income was $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $127.2 million in 2017 and $120.9 million in 2016. The increase in net interest income was $9.6 million, or 7.6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 and $6.3 million, or 5.2%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Average net interest-earning assets increased $147.2 million to $1.4 billion for the full year 2018 compared to $1.3 billion for the full year 2017 and increased $128.8 million to $1.3 billion for the full year 2017 compared to $1.2 billion for the full year 2016. The increase in average net interest-earning assets in 2018 reflects organic growth in loans and a decrease in average borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities and an increase in average deposits. The increase in average net interest-earning assets in 2017 reflects organic growth in loans and an increase in average investment securities, partially offset by increases in average deposits and average borrowings. Tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.33% in 2018 compared to 3.34% in 2017 and 3.48% in 2016. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest margin for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects higher overall funding costs due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2018 and 2017, partially offset by a higher average yield on interest-earning assets primarily due to loan portfolio growth, and a higher average yield on investment securities. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 reflects the higher overall funding costs due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in January 2017.\nTotal interest income increased to $169.0 million in 2018 compared to $149.8 million in 2017 as average interest-earning assets increased $283.8 million, or 7.4%, to $4.1 billion in 2018 compared to $3.8 billion in 2017. Interest income increased to $149.8 million in 2017 compared to $137.7 million in 2016, as average interest-earning assets increased $338.6 million to $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in 2016. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2018 reflects organic growth in loans, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2017 reflects organic growth in loans and an increase in average investment securities. The tax-equivalent average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.11% in 2018, 3.93% in 2017 and 3.96% in 2016.\nInterest income on loans increased to $144.4 million in 2018 compared to $126.4 million in 2017 and $116.7 million in 2016, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans. For the year ended December 31, 2018, average loans grew by $393.5 million, or 14.2%, to $3.2 billion as compared to $2.8 billion in\nPage -26-\n2017, and increased $279.7 million, or 11.2%, in 2017 as compared to $2.5 billion in 2016. The increases in average loans were the result of the organic growth in commercial real estate mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and real estate construction and land loans. The tax-equivalent average yield on loans was 4.56% in 2018, 4.57% in 2017 and 4.69% in 2016. The Company remains committed to growing loans with prudent underwriting, sensible pricing and limited credit and extension risk.\nInterest income on investment securities increased to $23.5 million in 2018 from $23.1 million in 2017 and $20.8 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a higher average yield on investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in the average investment securities. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 reflects a higher average yield on investment securities and growth in the investment securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, average total investment securities decreased $137.3 million, or 13.1%, to $910.7 million as compared to $1.0 billion in 2017, and increased $63.4 million in 2017 compared to $984.6 million in 2016. Interest income on investment securities included net amortization of premiums on securities of $4.0 million in 2018, compared to $6.4 million in 2017 and $6.5 million in 2016.\nTotal interest expense increased to $32.2 million in 2018, compared to $22.7 million in 2017 and $16.8 million in 2016. The increase in total interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was a result of an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. The increase in total interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was a result of an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.20% in 2018, 0.89% in 2017, and 0.72% in 2016. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher overall funding costs, due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2018, 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in January 2017. Since the Company's interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, in a rising rate environment the cost of funds increases faster than the yields on assets. The Company began extending the terms of certain matured borrowings by utilizing interest rate swap agreements at the end of the 2017 first quarter in anticipation of further Fed Funds rate increases. Additionally, a large percentage of deposits in money market accounts reprice at short-term market rates making the balance sheet more liability sensitive. The Bank continues its prudent management of deposit pricing. Average total interest-bearing liabilities were $2.7 billion in 2018, compared to $2.6 billion in 2017 and $2.3 billion in 2016. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in both average borrowings and average deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, average total deposits increased by $412.7 million to $3.5 billion as compared to $3.1 billion in 2017, and increased by $192.6 million, or 6.6%, in 2017 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2016. The increase in average total deposits reflects higher average savings, NOW and money market deposits, average demand deposits, and average certificates of deposit. The average balances in savings, NOW and money market accounts increased $205.0 million, or 11.9%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $132.4 million, or 8.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The average cost of savings, NOW and money market accounts was 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 0.46% in 2017 and 0.33% in 2016. Average demand deposits increased $136.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $64.0 million, or 5.8%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Average balances in certificates of deposit increased $71.7 million, or 32.6%, to $291.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $3.8 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The cost of average certificates of deposit increased to 1.65% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 1.17% in 2017 and 0.72% in 2016. Average public fund deposits comprised 15.4% of total average deposits during 2018, compared to 16.0% in 2017 and 17.1% in 2016.\nAverage federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $62.9 million, or 47.5%, to $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $132.5 million for 2017, and decreased $29.6 million, or 18.3%, in 2017 compared to $162.1 million for 2016. Average FHLB advances decreased $76.6 million, or 19.1%, to $324.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $401.3 million in 2017 and increased $125.7 million in 2017 compared to $275.6 million in 2016. Average subordinated debentures increased $140 thousand, or 0.2%, to $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $78.6 million for 2017, and increased $139 thousand, or 0.2%, compared to $78.4 million in 2016. The junior subordinated debentures were redeemed in January 2017.\nPage -27-\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Bank's principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs. The interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, the Bank's relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.\nBased on the Company's continuing review of the overall loan portfolio, the current asset quality of the portfolio, the growth in the loan portfolio and the net charge-offs, a provision for loan losses of $1.8 million was recorded in 2018, as compared to $14.1 million in 2017 and $5.6 million in 2016. Net charge-offs were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The charge-offs in 2018 resulted from the charge-off of one loan which was fully reserved for and partial charge-offs recognized on eleven taxi medallion loans attributable to payoff settlements accepted by the Bank. The charge-offs in 2017 resulted primarily from the charge-off of loans and specific reserves associated with two specific relationships. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans was 1,119%, 456% and 2,087% at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses totaled $31.4 million at December 31, 2018, $31.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $25.9 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of total loans was 0.96%, 1.02% and 1.00% at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Management continues to carefully monitor the loan portfolio as well as real estate trends in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the New York City boroughs.\nLoans totaling $87.9 million or 2.7%, of total loans at December 31, 2018 were categorized as classified loans compared to $85.3 million or 2.8%, at December 31, 2017 and $84.3 million, or 3.2%, at December 31, 2016. Classified loans include loans with credit quality indicators with the internally assigned grades of special mention, substandard and doubtful. These loans are categorized as classified loans as management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms. These loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed at least quarterly.\nAt December 31, 2018, $35.0 million of these classified loans were commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans. Of the $35.0 million of CRE loans, $33.5 million were current and $1.5 million were past due. At December 31, 2018, $12.4 million of classified loans were residential real estate loans with $11.0 million current and $1.4 million past due. Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represented $39.7 million of classified loans, with $39.1 million current and $0.6 million past due. Taxi medallion loans represented $16.2 million of the classified commercial, industrial and agricultural loans at December 31, 2018. All of the Bank's taxi medallion loans are collateralized by New York City medallions and have personal guarantees. All taxi medallion loans were current as of December 31, 2018. No new originations of taxi medallion loans are currently planned and management expects these balances to continue to decline through amortization and pay-offs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, nine taxi medallion loans totaling $6.9 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off. Four were paid in full and the Bank accepted settlements on the other five which resulted in partial charge-offs. In January 2019, seven additional taxi medallion loans, totaling $6.2 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off under Bank accepted settlements. The charge-offs related to these settlements were recognized in the 2018 fourth quarter. Taxi medallion loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, there was $0.3 million of classified real estate construction and land loans which were current and $0.4 million of classified multi-family loans which were current.\nCRE loans, including multi-family loans, represented $2.0 billion, or 59.9%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 compared to $1.9 billion, or 61.0%, at December 31, 2017 and $1.5 billion, or 59.2%, at December 31, 2016. The Bank's underwriting standards for CRE loans require an evaluation of the cash flow of the property, the overall cash flow of the borrower and related guarantors as well as the value of the real estate securing the loan. In addition, the Bank's underwriting standards for CRE loans are consistent with regulatory requirements with original loan to value ratios generally less than or equal to 75%. The Bank considers charge-off history, delinquency trends, cash flow analysis, and the impact of the local economy on commercial real estate values when evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nPage -28-\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had individually impaired loans as defined by FASB ASC No. 310, Receivables\u201d of $19.4 million and $22.5 million, respectively. For a loan to be considered impaired, management determines after review whether it is probable that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management applies its normal loan review procedures in making these judgments. Impaired loans include individually classified non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructuring loans ( TDRs\u201d) and at December 31, 2018 included $2.7 million in other impaired performing loans related to three taxi medallion loans which paid off in January 2019. For impaired loans, the Bank evaluates the impairment of the loan in accordance with FASB ASC 310-10-35-22. Impairment is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. For loans that are collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell is used to determine the fair value of the loan. The fair value of the collateral is determined based on recent appraised values. The fair value of the collateral less costs to sell or present value of expected cash flows is compared to the carrying value to determine if any write-down or specific loan loss allowance allocation is required. The decrease in impaired loans from December 31, 2017 was attributable to the payoff of certain TDRs, coupled with a decrease in non-accrual loans due to the charge-off of one loan and sales and payoffs, partially offset by new TDRs during the year ended December 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank modified certain loans as TDRs totaling $9.2 million.\nNon-accrual loans were $2.8 million, or 0.09%, of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million, or 0.22%, of total loans at December 31, 2017. TDRs represent $133 thousand of the non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018 and $5 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's other real estate owned at December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million, consisting of one property, compared to none at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth changes in the allowance for loan losses:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

2017 and increased by $2.1 million, or 12.8%, to $18.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.0 million in 2016. The decrease in total non-interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a $7.9 million net securities loss related to the balance sheet restructure in the second quarter 2018, and a decrease in title fee income, partially offset by increases in service charges and other fees, other operating income and gain on sale of Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) loans. The increase in total non-interest income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in service charges and other fees, gain on sale of SBA loans, title fee income, other operating income, BOLI income, partially offset by a decrease in net securities gains.\nNet securities losses of $7.9 million were recognized in 2018 compared to net securities gains of $38 thousand in 2017 and $0.4 million in 2016. The net securities losses in 2018 were attributable to the sale of $240.3 million of securities related to balance sheet restructure in the second quarter 2018. The net securities gains in 2016 were primarily attributable to the sale of $235.7 million of lower yielding securities in the 2016 second quarter as part of a deleveraging strategy by the Company.\nOther operating income increased $0.8 million to $3.5 million in 2018, compared to $2.7 million in 2017, primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in net gain of sale of loans, and increased $0.4 million to $2.7 million in 2017 compared to $2.3 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in loan swap fee income of $0.9 million.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense increased $6.5 million, or 7.0%, to $98.2 million in 2018 from $91.7 million in 2017, and increased $14.6 million, or 19.0%, to $91.7 million in 2017 compared to $77.1 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to an $8.9 million net fraud loss, higher salaries and benefits, professional services, office relocation costs, technology and communications expenses, and FDIC assessments, partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment, and marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to restructuring costs related to branch restructuring and charter conversion, and higher salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, technology and communications, marketing and advertising, and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower amortization of other intangible assets, professional services and FDIC assessments. The reversal of accrued acquisition costs in 2016 is due to the reversal of pending merger related liabilities recorded at the acquisition date, which have since been settled.\nThe Company incurred an $8.9 million pre-tax net fraud loss charge in 2018 related to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at the Bank. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.9 million to $50.5 million in 2018, compared to $46.6 million 2017 and increased $5.0 million from $41.6 million in 2016. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to additional staff related to business development, and risk management. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to additional staff related to new branches, business development, and risk management. Occupancy and equipment decreased $0.8\nPage -30-\nmillion to $13.2 million in 2018 compared to $14.0 million in 2017 and increased $1.2 million from $12.8 million in 2016. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expense in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the cost savings related to the execution of the Company's branch rationalization strategy. Technology and communications increased $0.7 million to $6.5 million in 2018 compared to $5.8 million in 2017 and increased $0.9 million from $4.9 million in 2016. Marketing and advertising decreased $0.1 million to $4.6 million in 2018 compared to $4.7 million in 2017 and increased $0.7 million from $4.0 million in 2016. Professional services increased $0.9 million to $4.0 million in 2018 compared to $3.1 million in 2017 and decreased $0.5 million from $3.6 million in 2016. FDIC assessments were $1.7 million in 2018, $1.3 million in 2017, and $1.6 million in 2016. The Company recorded amortization of other intangible assets of $0.9 million in 2018, $1.0 million in 2017, $2.6 million in 2016, primarily related to the CNB and FNBNY acquisitions. Other operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in 2018, $7.1 million in 2017, and $6.8 million in 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $9.8 million, or 51.8%, to $9.1 million in 2018 compared to $18.9 million in 2017, and increased $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from $18.8 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 18.9% in 2018, 48.0% in 2017 and 34.6% in 2016. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a lower effective tax rate in 2018 due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher income before income taxes in 2018. Income tax expense in 2017 included a $7.6 million charge to write-down the Company's deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter 2017. The Company estimates it will record income tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 22% in 2019.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $270.7 million, or 6.1%, to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased $200.6 million to $295.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, including proceeds from a large deposit made in December 2018 which was not readily deployed into securities or loans. Total securities decreased $111.1 million to $865.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, which includes the Company's sale of $238.3 million of securities in 2018. Total loans held for investment, net, increased $173.1 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, which includes the Company's sale of $39.8 million of commercial real estate and multi-family loans in 2018. The ability to grow the loan portfolio, while minimizing interest rate risk sensitivity and maintaining credit quality, remains a strong focus of management.\nTotal liabilities increased $246.1 million, or 6.2%, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $551.9 million, or 16.5%, to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Demand deposits increased $109.9 million, or 8.2%, to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Savings, NOW and money market deposits increased $334.8 million, or 18.9%, to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit increased $107.1 million, or 48.2%, to $329.5 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The deposit growth in 2018 reflects the Company's strategy to fund loan growth primarily with deposits. Federal funds purchased were zero at December 31, 2018 compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2017. FHLB advances decreased $260.9 million, or 52.0%, to $240.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in wholesale borrowings in 2018 reflects the Company's strategy to pay down its higher cost borrowings.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $24.6 million, or 5.7%, to $453.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to net income of $39.2 million, share based compensation of $3.5 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( DRP\u201d) of $1.0 million, partially offset by $18.3 million in dividends.\nLoans\nDuring 2018, the Company continued to experience growth in most loan portfolios. The concentration of loans in the Company's primary market areas may increase risk. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Bank's principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York\nPage -31-\nCity boroughs. The local economic conditions on Long Island have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations, the quality of loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans. A considerable decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the Company's control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of the Company's operations. Additionally, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings.\nThe interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, the Bank's relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the FRB, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.\nThe Bank targets its business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to the underwriting of loans, there are certain risks, including the risk of non-payment that are associated with each type of loan that the Bank markets. Approximately 79.6% of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was secured by real estate. Commercial real estate loans represented 42.0% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Multi-family mortgage loans represented 17.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Residential real estate mortgage loans represented 15.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio, including home equity lines of credit representing 2.2% and residential mortgages representing 13.7% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Real estate construction and land loans represented 3.8% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties. Home equity loans represent loans originated in the Bank's geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of 75% or less. The Bank's residential mortgage portfolio included approximately $54.9 million in interest only mortgages at December 31, 2018. The underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization. The Bank uses conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate itself from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on Long Island and the New York City boroughs that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans.\nThe remainder of the loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and consumer loans, which represented 20.4% of the Bank's loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018. The commercial loans are made to businesses and include term loans, lines of credit, senior secured loans to corporations, equipment financing and taxi medallion loans. The primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business, the experience and quality of the borrowers' management, the business climate, and the impact of economic factors. The primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower, such as the risk of a borrower's unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower's other existing indebtedness, and the value of the collateral securing the loan if the Bank must take possession of the collateral.\nThe Bank's policy for charging off loans is a multi-step process. A loan is considered a potential charge-off when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of 90, 120 or 180 days, depending upon the loan type, as of the end of the prior month. In addition to delinquency criteria, other triggering events may include, but are not limited to, notice of bankruptcy by the borrower or guarantor, death of the borrower, and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral. These loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the CRMC. A loan is charged off when a loss is reasonably assured. The recovery of charged-off balances is actively pursued until the potential for recovery has been exhausted, or until the expense of collection does not justify the recovery efforts.\nTotal loans grew $173.1 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2017 with commercial real mortgage loans being the largest contributor of the growth. Commercial real estate mortgage loans increased $79.7 million, or 6.2%, during 2018. Residential real estate mortgage loans increased $55.5 million, or 12.0%, during 2018. Commercial, industrial and agricultural loans increased $29.7 million, or 4.8%, in 2018. Real estate construction and land loans increased $15.6 million, or 14.5%, in 2018. Multi-family mortgage loans and\nPage -32-\ninstallment/consumer loans both decreased slightly during 2018. Fixed rate loans represented 23.9% and 24.3% of total loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the major classifications of loans at the dates

million at December 31, 2017, including restricted securities totaling $24.0 million at December 31, 2018 and $35.3 million at December 31, 2017. The available for sale portfolio decreased $79.0 million to $680.9 million from $759.9 million at December 31, 2017. Securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors. During 2018, the Company sold $238.3 million of securities available for sale compared to $52.4 million in 2017. The decrease in securities available for sale is primarily the result of a $93.4 million decrease in residential mortgage-backed securities, a $46.3 million decrease in state and municipal obligations, and a $27.8 million decrease in GSE securities, partially offset by a $50.4 million increase in residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and a $41.9 million increase in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations. Securities held to maturity decreased $20.7 million to $160.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $180.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in securities held to maturity is primarily the result of a $1.9 million decrease in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations, a $6.0 million decrease in residential collateralized mortgage obligations, a $7.2 million decrease in state and municipal obligations, and a $3.9 million decrease in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Fixed rate securities\nPage -34-\nrepresented 88.4% of total available for sale and held to maturity securities at December 31, 2018 compared to 87.5% at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the fair values, amortized costs, contractual maturities and approximate weighted average yields of the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios at December 31, 2018. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Individual, partnership and corporate ( core deposits\u201d) account balances increased $430.8 million and public funds and brokered deposits increased $121.1 million.

Liquidity management addresses the ability of the Company to meet financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments and deposit withdrawals, either on demand or on contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise.\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and dividend capabilities from the Bank. Cash available for distribution of dividends to shareholders of the Company is primarily derived from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. During 2018, the Bank paid $15.0 million in cash dividends to the Company. Prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the Bank's net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. As of January 1, 2019, the Bank had $51.4 million of retained net income available for dividends to the Company. In the event that the Company subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs. The Company did not make any capital contributions to the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Bank's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and investment securities principal repayments and maturities, lines of credit with other financial institutions including the FHLB and FRB, growth in core deposits and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered deposits. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing securities and short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit flows, loans, and asset and liability management objectives. Historically, the Bank has relied on its deposit base, drawn through its full-service branches that serve its market area and local municipal deposits, as its principal source of funding. The Bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers, while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its strategies.\nThe Bank's Asset/Liability and Funds Management Policy allows for wholesale borrowings of up to 25% of total assets. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had aggregate lines of credit of $373.0 million with unaffiliated correspondent banks to provide short-term credit for liquidity requirements. Of these aggregate lines of credit, $353.0 million is available on an unsecured basis. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had no overnight borrowings outstanding under these lines. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $50.0 million in overnight borrowings outstanding. The Bank also has the ability, as a member of the FHLB system, to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the Bank. The Bank also has a master repurchase agreement with the FHLB, which increases its borrowing capacity. As of December\nPage -36-\n31, 2018, the Bank had no FHLB overnight borrowings outstanding and $240.4 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $185.0 million in FHLB overnight borrowings and $316.4 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $0.5 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $0.9 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. In addition, the Bank has approved broker relationships for the purpose of issuing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $101.6 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposit and $150.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $44.9 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposits and $163.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts.\nLiquidity policies are established by senior management and reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors at least annually. Management continually monitors the liquidity position and believes that sufficient liquidity exists to meet all of the Company's operating requirements. The Bank's liquidity levels are affected by the use of short-term and wholesale borrowings and the amount of public funds in the deposit mix. Excess short-term liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sold or in an interest-earning account at the FRB.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations.\nThe following table presents contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2018:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFour to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOver Five\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,687\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB advances and repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n329,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n252,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n699,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n500,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n99,065\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSome financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $65.8 million in outstanding loan commitments and $636.8 million in outstanding commitments for various lines of credit including unused overdraft lines. The Company also had $26.0 million of standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2018. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' equity increased to $453.8 million at December 31, 2018 from $429.2 million at December 31, 2017 as a result of undistributed net income, the shares of common stock issued under the DRP, and the stock-based compensation plan; partially offset by the declaration of dividends, and the net change in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, pension benefits, and cash flow hedges. The ratio of average stockholders' equity to average total assets was 10.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 10.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's capital strength is paralleled by the solid capital position of the Bank, as reflected in the excess of its regulatory capital ratios over the risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels required for classification as a well capitalized\u201d institution by the FDIC (see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Since 2013, the Company\nPage -37-\nhas actively managed its capital position in response to its growth. During this period, the Company has raised $261.2 million in capital through the following initiatives:\n \u00b7 On October 8, 2013, the Company completed a public offering with net proceeds of $37.6 million in capital from the sale of 1,926,250 shares of common stock. The purpose of the offering was in part to provide additional capital to Bridge Bancorp to support its acquisition of FNBNY and for general corporate purposes. \n \u00b7 On February 14, 2014, the Company issued 240,598 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $5.9 million in capital. These shares were issued directly in connection with the acquisition of FNBNY. \n \u00b7 On June 19, 2015, the Company issued 5,647,268 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $157.1 million in capital. These shares were issued in connection with the acquisition of CNB. \n \u00b7 On November 28, 2016, the Company completed a public offering with net proceeds of $47.5 million in capital from the sale of 1,613,000 shares of common stock. The purpose of the offering was in part to provide additional capital to Bridge Bancorp to support organic growth, the pursuit of strategic acquisition opportunities and other general corporate purposes, including contributing capital to Bank. \n \u00b7 Proceeds of $12.9 million in capital through issuance of common stock through the DRP. \nThe Company has the ability to issue additional common stock and/or preferred stock should the need arise under a shelf registration statement filed in April 2016.\nThe Company had returns on average equity of 8.66% and 4.64%, and returns on average assets of 0.87% and 0.49%, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company also utilizes cash dividends and stock repurchases to manage capital levels. In 2018, the Company declared four quarterly cash dividends totaling $18.3 million compared to four quarterly cash dividends of $18.2 million in 2017. The dividend payout ratios for 2018 and 2017 were 46.76% and 88.80%, respectively. The Company continues its trend of uninterrupted dividends. In March 2006, the Company approved its stock repurchase plan allowing the repurchase of up to 5% of its then current outstanding shares, 309,000 shares. The Company considers opportunities for stock repurchases carefully. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2018 and 2017. In February 2019, the Company announced the approval of a repurchase program for up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock, replacing the previous plan. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase plan.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or in the same magnitude, as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, which are\nPage -38-\nbeyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the FRB.\nImpact of Prospective Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act Safe Harbor Statement\nThis report may contain statements relating to the future results of the Company (including certain projections and business trends) that are considered forward-looking statements\u201d as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA\u201d).

The Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the PSLRA.\nFactors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include, but are not limited to, changing economic conditions; legislative and regulatory changes, including increases in FDIC insurance rates; monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government; changes in tax policies; rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities; changes in interest rates; deposit flows; the cost of funds; demand for loan products; demand for financial services; competition; the Company's ability to successfully integrate acquired entities; changes in the quality and composition of the Bank's loan and investment portfolios; changes in management's business strategies; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; changes in real estate values; expanded regulatory requirements as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could adversely affect operating results; and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report including factors set forth under Item 1A., Risk Factors, and in quarterly and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and the Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWho The Company Is and How It Generates Income\nBridge Bancorp, Inc., a New York corporation, is a bank holding company formed in 1989. On a parent-only basis, the Company has had minimal results of operations. The Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, BNB Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and debit card processing programs, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of its non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from its title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects the Bank's net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity.\nYear and Quarterly Highlights\n \u00b7 Net income for the 2018 fourth quarter of $13.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. \n \u00b7 Net income for the full year 2018 was $39.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $20.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the full year 2017. Inclusive of: \nPage -20-\noPre-tax charge of $8.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share after tax, related to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at BNB in the 2018 third quarter.\noPre-tax net securities losses of $7.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share after tax, related to the Company's balance sheet restructure in the 2018 second quarter.\noPre-tax charge of $0.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share after tax, related to the Company's office relocation costs in the 2018 fourth quarter.\n \u00b7 Net interest income increased to $136.8 million for 2018, compared to $127.2 million in 2017. \n \u00b7 Tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.33% for 2018 and 3.34% in 2017. \n \u00b7 Total assets of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $270.7 million, or 6.1%, over December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 Total loans held for investment at December 31, 2018 of $3.3 billion, an increase of $173.1 million, or 5.6%, over December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 Total deposits of $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $551.9 million, or 16.5%, over December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 Allowance for loan losses was 0.96% of loans as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.02% at December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 A cash dividend of $0.23 per share was declared and paid in January 2019 for the fourth quarter. \nSignificant Recent Events\nNet Fraud Loss\nThe Company incurred a pre-tax charge, net of recovery, of $8.9 million in 2018 relating to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at the Bank. The Company is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter. The customer has filed a petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. In January 2019, the Company filed a claim for the loss with its insurance carrier, however, the extent and amount of coverage is not yet certain.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nIn December 2018, in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.50 percent. Information received since the FOMC met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food or energy remain near 2 percent. In support of its goals to foster maximum employment and price stability, in January 2019 the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2.25 to 2.50 percent. The FOMC continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2.00 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.\nInterest rates have been at or near historic lows for an extended period of time. Growth and service strategies have the potential to offset the compression on the net interest margin with volume as the customer base grows through expanding the Bank's footprint, while maintaining and developing existing relationships. Since 2010, the Bank has opened fifteen branches, including one in November 2018 in Melville, New York. The Bank has also grown through acquisitions\nPage -21-\nincluding the June 2015 acquisition of Community National Bank ( CNB\u201d), the February 2014 acquisition of First National Bank of New York ( FNBNY\u201d), and the May 2011 acquisition of Hamptons State Bank ( HSB\u201d). Management will continue to seek opportunities to expand its reach into other contiguous markets by network expansion, or through the addition of professionals with established customer relationships. Recent and pending acquisitions of local competitors may also provide additional growth opportunities.\nThe Bank continues to face challenges associated with ever-increasing regulations and the current low interest rate environment. Over time, additional rate increases should provide some relief to net interest margin compression as new loans are funded and securities are reinvested at higher rates. However, in the short term, the fair value of available for sale securities declines when rates increase, resulting in net unrealized losses and a reduction in stockholders' equity. Strategies for managing for the eventuality of higher rates have a cost. Extending liability maturities or shortening the term of assets increases interest expense and reduces interest income. An additional method for managing in a higher rate environment is to grow stable core deposits, requiring continued investment in people, technology and branches. Over time, these strategies should provide long-term benefits.\nThe Company has established five strategic objectives to achieve its vision: (1) acquire new customers in growth markets; (2) build new sales and marketing disciplines; (3) deepen customer relationships; (4) expand use of automation; and (5) improve talent management. Management believes there remain opportunities to grow its franchise and that continued investments to generate core funding, quality loans and new sources of revenue remain keys to continue creating long-term shareholder value. The ability to attract, retain, train and cultivate employees at all levels of the Company remains significant to meeting corporate objectives. In particular, management is focused on expanding and retaining its loan team as it continues to grow the loan portfolio. The Company has capitalized on opportunities presented by the market and diligently seeks opportunities to grow and strengthen the franchise. The Company recognizes the potential risks of the current economic environment and will monitor the impact of market events as management evaluates loans and investments and considers growth initiatives. Management and the Board have built a solid foundation for growth and the Company is positioned to adapt to anticipated changes in the industry resulting from new regulations and legislative initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of the Company's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. The Company's policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is its most critical accounting policy. This policy is important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations, and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition.\nThe following is a description of this critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nManagement considers the accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses to be the most critical and requires complex management judgment. The judgments made regarding the allowance for loan losses can have a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. The allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances. The Bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans, repayment patterns, probable incurred losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and various types of concentrations of credit. Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to the allowance.\nPage -22-\nIndividual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) No. 310, Receivables\u201d. Such valuation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectability in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured, considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell, if any, or the present value of expected future cash flows, or the loan's observable market value. Any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan. Pursuant to the Company's policy, loan losses must be charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectable. Assumptions and judgments by management, in conjunction with outside sources, are used to determine whether full collectability of a loan is not reasonably assured. These assumptions and judgments are also used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan's observable market value. Individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired. Individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments. The results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses.\nLoan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with the Bank's lending activities, but which, unlike individual allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. Pool evaluations are broken down into loans with homogenous characteristics by loan type and include commercial real estate mortgages, owner and non-owner occupied; multi-family mortgage loans; residential real estate mortgages, home equity loans; commercial, industrial and agricultural loans, secured and unsecured; real estate construction and land loans; and consumer loans. Management considers a variety of factors in determining the adequacy of the valuation allowance and has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses in each pool of loans. Management considers the Bank's charge-off history along with the growth in the portfolio as well as the Bank's credit administration and asset management philosophies and procedures when determining the allowances for each pool. In addition, management evaluates and considers credit risk ratings, which includes management's evaluation of: cash flow, collateral, guarantor support, financial disclosures, industry trends and strength of borrowers' management, the impact that economic and market conditions may have on the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Finally, management evaluates and considers the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data. These evaluations are inherently subjective because, even though they are based on objective data, it is management's interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance. If the evaluations prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses.\nFor Purchased Credit Impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans, a valuation allowance is established when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all the cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition. A specific allowance is established when subsequent evaluations of expected cash flows from PCI loans reflect a decrease in those estimates. The allowance established represents the excess of the recorded investment in those loans over the present value of the currently estimated future cash flow, discounted at the last effective accounting yield.\nThe Bank uses assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and probable losses in the loan portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, management's judgment and experience play a key role in recording the allowance estimates. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by provisions charged to earnings. Furthermore, an improvement in the expected cash flows related to PCI loans would result in a reduction of the required specific allowance with a corresponding credit to the provision.\nThe Credit Risk Management Committee ( CRMC\u201d) is comprised of Bank management. The adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly, with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the CRMC, based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Each quarter, members of the CRMC meet with the Credit Risk Committee of the Board to review credit risk trends and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Based on the CRMC's review of the classified loans, delinquency and charge-off trends, and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the\nPage -23-\nallowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination.\nFor additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $39.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $20.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $35.5 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income increased $18.7 million, or 91.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and net income for 2017 decreased $15.0 million, or 42.1%, as compared to 2016. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 include: (i) a $9.6 million, or 7.6%, increase in net interest income; (ii) a $12.3 million, or 87.2%, decrease in the provision for loan losses; (iii) a $6.5 million, or 36.1%, decrease in total non-interest income; (iv) a $6.5 million, or 7.0%, increase in total non-interest expense; and (v) a $9.8 million, or 51.8%, decrease in income tax expense. The effective income tax rate was 18.9% for 2018 compared to 48.0% for 2017. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 include: (i) a $6.3 million, or 5.2%, increase in net interest income; (ii) an $8.5 million increase in the provision for loan losses; (iii) a $2.1 million, or 12.8%, increase in total non-interest income; and (iv) a $14.6 million, or 19.0%, increase in total non-interest expense. The effective income tax rate was 48.0% for 2017 compared to 34.6% for 2016.\nThe weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 19.5 million, 19.4 million and 17.9 million, respectively. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were higher for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016 due in part to the $50 million common stock offering in November 2016.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the primary contributor to earnings, represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expenses on interest- bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company's average consolidated balance sheets and its consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for those periods on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from daily average balances and include non-accrual loans. The yields and costs include fees and costs, which are considered adjustments to yields. Interest on non-accrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income. The Tax Act lowered the U.S, federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company's tax-equivalent adjustment to interest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the lower federal statutory tax rate in 2018. For purposes of this table, the average balances for investments in debt and equity securities exclude unrealized appreciation/depreciation due to the application of FASB ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d\n \nPage -24-\n\n (1) Amounts are net of deferred origination costs/(fees) and the allowance for loan losses. \n (2) Presented on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, 35% and 35% for the years ended December 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nRate/Volume Analysis\nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes. The following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net changes. For purposes of this table, changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate. Due to the numerous simultaneous\nPage -25-\nvolume and rate changes during the periods analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In addition, average interest-earning assets include non-accrual loans.\n\n (1) Amounts are net of deferred origination costs/(fees) and the allowance for loan losses. \n (2) Presented on a tax equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, 35% and 35% for the years ended December 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nNet interest income was $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $127.2 million in 2017 and $120.9 million in 2016. The increase in net interest income was $9.6 million, or 7.6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 and $6.3 million, or 5.2%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Average net interest-earning assets increased $147.2 million to $1.4 billion for the full year 2018 compared to $1.3 billion for the full year 2017 and increased $128.8 million to $1.3 billion for the full year 2017 compared to $1.2 billion for the full year 2016. The increase in average net interest-earning assets in 2018 reflects organic growth in loans and a decrease in average borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities and an increase in average deposits. The increase in average net interest-earning assets in 2017 reflects organic growth in loans and an increase in average investment securities, partially offset by increases in average deposits and average borrowings. Tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.33% in 2018 compared to 3.34% in 2017 and 3.48% in 2016. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest margin for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects higher overall funding costs due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2018 and 2017, partially offset by a higher average yield on interest-earning assets primarily due to loan portfolio growth, and a higher average yield on investment securities. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 reflects the higher overall funding costs due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in January 2017.\nTotal interest income increased to $169.0 million in 2018 compared to $149.8 million in 2017 as average interest-earning assets increased $283.8 million, or 7.4%, to $4.1 billion in 2018 compared to $3.8 billion in 2017. Interest income increased to $149.8 million in 2017 compared to $137.7 million in 2016, as average interest-earning assets increased $338.6 million to $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in 2016. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2018 reflects organic growth in loans, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2017 reflects organic growth in loans and an increase in average investment securities. The tax-equivalent average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.11% in 2018, 3.93% in 2017 and 3.96% in 2016.\nInterest income on loans increased to $144.4 million in 2018 compared to $126.4 million in 2017 and $116.7 million in 2016, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans. For the year ended December 31, 2018, average loans grew by $393.5 million, or 14.2%, to $3.2 billion as compared to $2.8 billion in\nPage -26-\n2017, and increased $279.7 million, or 11.2%, in 2017 as compared to $2.5 billion in 2016. The increases in average loans were the result of the organic growth in commercial real estate mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and real estate construction and land loans. The tax-equivalent average yield on loans was 4.56% in 2018, 4.57% in 2017 and 4.69% in 2016. The Company remains committed to growing loans with prudent underwriting, sensible pricing and limited credit and extension risk.\nInterest income on investment securities increased to $23.5 million in 2018 from $23.1 million in 2017 and $20.8 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a higher average yield on investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in the average investment securities. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 reflects a higher average yield on investment securities and growth in the investment securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, average total investment securities decreased $137.3 million, or 13.1%, to $910.7 million as compared to $1.0 billion in 2017, and increased $63.4 million in 2017 compared to $984.6 million in 2016. Interest income on investment securities included net amortization of premiums on securities of $4.0 million in 2018, compared to $6.4 million in 2017 and $6.5 million in 2016.\nTotal interest expense increased to $32.2 million in 2018, compared to $22.7 million in 2017 and $16.8 million in 2016. The increase in total interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was a result of an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. The increase in total interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was a result of an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.20% in 2018, 0.89% in 2017, and 0.72% in 2016. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher overall funding costs, due in part to the Fed Funds rate increases in 2018, 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in January 2017. Since the Company's interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, in a rising rate environment the cost of funds increases faster than the yields on assets. The Company began extending the terms of certain matured borrowings by utilizing interest rate swap agreements at the end of the 2017 first quarter in anticipation of further Fed Funds rate increases. Additionally, a large percentage of deposits in money market accounts reprice at short-term market rates making the balance sheet more liability sensitive. The Bank continues its prudent management of deposit pricing. Average total interest-bearing liabilities were $2.7 billion in 2018, compared to $2.6 billion in 2017 and $2.3 billion in 2016. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in both average borrowings and average deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, average total deposits increased by $412.7 million to $3.5 billion as compared to $3.1 billion in 2017, and increased by $192.6 million, or 6.6%, in 2017 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2016. The increase in average total deposits reflects higher average savings, NOW and money market deposits, average demand deposits, and average certificates of deposit. The average balances in savings, NOW and money market accounts increased $205.0 million, or 11.9%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $132.4 million, or 8.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The average cost of savings, NOW and money market accounts was 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 0.46% in 2017 and 0.33% in 2016. Average demand deposits increased $136.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $64.0 million, or 5.8%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Average balances in certificates of deposit increased $71.7 million, or 32.6%, to $291.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $3.8 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The cost of average certificates of deposit increased to 1.65% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 1.17% in 2017 and 0.72% in 2016. Average public fund deposits comprised 15.4% of total average deposits during 2018, compared to 16.0% in 2017 and 17.1% in 2016.\nAverage federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $62.9 million, or 47.5%, to $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $132.5 million for 2017, and decreased $29.6 million, or 18.3%, in 2017 compared to $162.1 million for 2016. Average FHLB advances decreased $76.6 million, or 19.1%, to $324.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $401.3 million in 2017 and increased $125.7 million in 2017 compared to $275.6 million in 2016. Average subordinated debentures increased $140 thousand, or 0.2%, to $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $78.6 million for 2017, and increased $139 thousand, or 0.2%, compared to $78.4 million in 2016. The junior subordinated debentures were redeemed in January 2017.\nPage -27-\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Bank's principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs. The interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, the Bank's relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.\nBased on the Company's continuing review of the overall loan portfolio, the current asset quality of the portfolio, the growth in the loan portfolio and the net charge-offs, a provision for loan losses of $1.8 million was recorded in 2018, as compared to $14.1 million in 2017 and $5.6 million in 2016. Net charge-offs were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The charge-offs in 2018 resulted from the charge-off of one loan which was fully reserved for and partial charge-offs recognized on eleven taxi medallion loans attributable to payoff settlements accepted by the Bank. The charge-offs in 2017 resulted primarily from the charge-off of loans and specific reserves associated with two specific relationships. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans was 1,119%, 456% and 2,087% at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses totaled $31.4 million at December 31, 2018, $31.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $25.9 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of total loans was 0.96%, 1.02% and 1.00% at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Management continues to carefully monitor the loan portfolio as well as real estate trends in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the New York City boroughs.\nLoans totaling $87.9 million or 2.7%, of total loans at December 31, 2018 were categorized as classified loans compared to $85.3 million or 2.8%, at December 31, 2017 and $84.3 million, or 3.2%, at December 31, 2016. Classified loans include loans with credit quality indicators with the internally assigned grades of special mention, substandard and doubtful. These loans are categorized as classified loans as management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms. These loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed at least quarterly.\nAt December 31, 2018, $35.0 million of these classified loans were commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans. Of the $35.0 million of CRE loans, $33.5 million were current and $1.5 million were past due. At December 31, 2018, $12.4 million of classified loans were residential real estate loans with $11.0 million current and $1.4 million past due. Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represented $39.7 million of classified loans, with $39.1 million current and $0.6 million past due. Taxi medallion loans represented $16.2 million of the classified commercial, industrial and agricultural loans at December 31, 2018. All of the Bank's taxi medallion loans are collateralized by New York City medallions and have personal guarantees. All taxi medallion loans were current as of December 31, 2018. No new originations of taxi medallion loans are currently planned and management expects these balances to continue to decline through amortization and pay-offs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, nine taxi medallion loans totaling $6.9 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off. Four were paid in full and the Bank accepted settlements on the other five which resulted in partial charge-offs. In January 2019, seven additional taxi medallion loans, totaling $6.2 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off under Bank accepted settlements. The charge-offs related to these settlements were recognized in the 2018 fourth quarter. Taxi medallion loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, there was $0.3 million of classified real estate construction and land loans which were current and $0.4 million of classified multi-family loans which were current.\nCRE loans, including multi-family loans, represented $2.0 billion, or 59.9%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 compared to $1.9 billion, or 61.0%, at December 31, 2017 and $1.5 billion, or 59.2%, at December 31, 2016. The Bank's underwriting standards for CRE loans require an evaluation of the cash flow of the property, the overall cash flow of the borrower and related guarantors as well as the value of the real estate securing the loan. In addition, the Bank's underwriting standards for CRE loans are consistent with regulatory requirements with original loan to value ratios generally less than or equal to 75%. The Bank considers charge-off history, delinquency trends, cash flow analysis, and the impact of the local economy on commercial real estate values when evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nPage -28-\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had individually impaired loans as defined by FASB ASC No. 310, Receivables\u201d of $19.4 million and $22.5 million, respectively. For a loan to be considered impaired, management determines after review whether it is probable that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management applies its normal loan review procedures in making these judgments. Impaired loans include individually classified non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructuring loans ( TDRs\u201d) and at December 31, 2018 included $2.7 million in other impaired performing loans related to three taxi medallion loans which paid off in January 2019. For impaired loans, the Bank evaluates the impairment of the loan in accordance with FASB ASC 310-10-35-22. Impairment is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. For loans that are collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell is used to determine the fair value of the loan. The fair value of the collateral is determined based on recent appraised values. The fair value of the collateral less costs to sell or present value of expected cash flows is compared to the carrying value to determine if any write-down or specific loan loss allowance allocation is required. The decrease in impaired loans from December 31, 2017 was attributable to the payoff of certain TDRs, coupled with a decrease in non-accrual loans due to the charge-off of one loan and sales and payoffs, partially offset by new TDRs during the year ended December 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank modified certain loans as TDRs totaling $9.2 million.\nNon-accrual loans were $2.8 million, or 0.09%, of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million, or 0.22%, of total loans at December 31, 2017. TDRs represent $133 thousand of the non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018 and $5 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's other real estate owned at December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million, consisting of one property, compared to none at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth changes in the allowance for loan losses:\n\nPage -29-\nAllocation of Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the total allowance for loan losses by loan classification:\n\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal non-interest income decreased $6.5 million, or 36.1%, in 2018 to $11.6 million, compared to $18.1 million in 2017 and increased by $2.1 million, or 12.8%, to $18.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.0 million in 2016. The decrease in total non-interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a $7.9 million net securities loss related to the balance sheet restructure in the second quarter 2018, and a decrease in title fee income, partially offset by increases in service charges and other fees, other operating income and gain on sale of Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) loans. The increase in total non-interest income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in service charges and other fees, gain on sale of SBA loans, title fee income, other operating income, BOLI income, partially offset by a decrease in net securities gains.\nNet securities losses of $7.9 million were recognized in 2018 compared to net securities gains of $38 thousand in 2017 and $0.4 million in 2016. The net securities losses in 2018 were attributable to the sale of $240.3 million of securities related to balance sheet restructure in the second quarter 2018. The net securities gains in 2016 were primarily attributable to the sale of $235.7 million of lower yielding securities in the 2016 second quarter as part of a deleveraging strategy by the Company.\nOther operating income increased $0.8 million to $3.5 million in 2018, compared to $2.7 million in 2017, primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in net gain of sale of loans, and increased $0.4 million to $2.7 million in 2017 compared to $2.3 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in loan swap fee income of $0.9 million.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense increased $6.5 million, or 7.0%, to $98.2 million in 2018 from $91.7 million in 2017, and increased $14.6 million, or 19.0%, to $91.7 million in 2017 compared to $77.1 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to an $8.9 million net fraud loss, higher salaries and benefits, professional services, office relocation costs, technology and communications expenses, and FDIC assessments, partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment, and marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to restructuring costs related to branch restructuring and charter conversion, and higher salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, technology and communications, marketing and advertising, and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower amortization of other intangible assets, professional services and FDIC assessments. The reversal of accrued acquisition costs in 2016 is due to the reversal of pending merger related liabilities recorded at the acquisition date, which have since been settled.\nThe Company incurred an $8.9 million pre-tax net fraud loss charge in 2018 related to the fraudulent conduct of a business customer through its deposit accounts at the Bank. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.9 million to $50.5 million in 2018, compared to $46.6 million 2017 and increased $5.0 million from $41.6 million in 2016. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to additional staff related to business development, and risk management. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to additional staff related to new branches, business development, and risk management. Occupancy and equipment decreased $0.8\nPage -30-\nmillion to $13.2 million in 2018 compared to $14.0 million in 2017 and increased $1.2 million from $12.8 million in 2016. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expense in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the cost savings related to the execution of the Company's branch rationalization strategy. Technology and communications increased $0.7 million to $6.5 million in 2018 compared to $5.8 million in 2017 and increased $0.9 million from $4.9 million in 2016. Marketing and advertising decreased $0.1 million to $4.6 million in 2018 compared to $4.7 million in 2017 and increased $0.7 million from $4.0 million in 2016. Professional services increased $0.9 million to $4.0 million in 2018 compared to $3.1 million in 2017 and decreased $0.5 million from $3.6 million in 2016. FDIC assessments were $1.7 million in 2018, $1.3 million in 2017, and $1.6 million in 2016. The Company recorded amortization of other intangible assets of $0.9 million in 2018, $1.0 million in 2017, $2.6 million in 2016, primarily related to the CNB and FNBNY acquisitions. Other operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in 2018, $7.1 million in 2017, and $6.8 million in 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $9.8 million, or 51.8%, to $9.1 million in 2018 compared to $18.9 million in 2017, and increased $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from $18.8 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 18.9% in 2018, 48.0% in 2017 and 34.6% in 2016. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a lower effective tax rate in 2018 due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher income before income taxes in 2018. Income tax expense in 2017 included a $7.6 million charge to write-down the Company's deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter 2017. The Company estimates it will record income tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 22% in 2019.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $270.7 million, or 6.1%, to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased $200.6 million to $295.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, including proceeds from a large deposit made in December 2018 which was not readily deployed into securities or loans. Total securities decreased $111.1 million to $865.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, which includes the Company's sale of $238.3 million of securities in 2018. Total loans held for investment, net, increased $173.1 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, which includes the Company's sale of $39.8 million of commercial real estate and multi-family loans in 2018. The ability to grow the loan portfolio, while minimizing interest rate risk sensitivity and maintaining credit quality, remains a strong focus of management.\nTotal liabilities increased $246.1 million, or 6.2%, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $551.9 million, or 16.5%, to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Demand deposits increased $109.9 million, or 8.2%, to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Savings, NOW and money market deposits increased $334.8 million, or 18.9%, to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit increased $107.1 million, or 48.2%, to $329.5 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The deposit growth in 2018 reflects the Company's strategy to fund loan growth primarily with deposits. Federal funds purchased were zero at December 31, 2018 compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2017. FHLB advances decreased $260.9 million, or 52.0%, to $240.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in wholesale borrowings in 2018 reflects the Company's strategy to pay down its higher cost borrowings.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $24.6 million, or 5.7%, to $453.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to net income of $39.2 million, share based compensation of $3.5 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( DRP\u201d) of $1.0 million, partially offset by $18.3 million in dividends.\nLoans\nDuring 2018, the Company continued to experience growth in most loan portfolios. The concentration of loans in the Company's primary market areas may increase risk. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Bank's principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York\nPage -31-\nCity boroughs. The local economic conditions on Long Island have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations, the quality of loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans. A considerable decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the Company's control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of the Company's operations. Additionally, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings.\nThe interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, the Bank's relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the FRB, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.\nThe Bank targets its business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to the underwriting of loans, there are certain risks, including the risk of non-payment that are associated with each type of loan that the Bank markets. Approximately 79.6% of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was secured by real estate. Commercial real estate loans represented 42.0% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Multi-family mortgage loans represented 17.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Residential real estate mortgage loans represented 15.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio, including home equity lines of credit representing 2.2% and residential mortgages representing 13.7% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Real estate construction and land loans represented 3.8% of the Bank's loan portfolio. Risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties. Home equity loans represent loans originated in the Bank's geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of 75% or less. The Bank's residential mortgage portfolio included approximately $54.9 million in interest only mortgages at December 31, 2018. The underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization. The Bank uses conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate itself from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on Long Island and the New York City boroughs that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans.\nThe remainder of the loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and consumer loans, which represented 20.4% of the Bank's loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018. The commercial loans are made to businesses and include term loans, lines of credit, senior secured loans to corporations, equipment financing and taxi medallion loans. The primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business, the experience and quality of the borrowers' management, the business climate, and the impact of economic factors. The primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower, such as the risk of a borrower's unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower's other existing indebtedness, and the value of the collateral securing the loan if the Bank must take possession of the collateral.\nThe Bank's policy for charging off loans is a multi-step process. A loan is considered a potential charge-off when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of 90, 120 or 180 days, depending upon the loan type, as of the end of the prior month. In addition to delinquency criteria, other triggering events may include, but are not limited to, notice of bankruptcy by the borrower or guarantor, death of the borrower, and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral. These loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the CRMC. A loan is charged off when a loss is reasonably assured. The recovery of charged-off balances is actively pursued until the potential for recovery has been exhausted, or until the expense of collection does not justify the recovery efforts.\nTotal loans grew $173.1 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2017 with commercial real mortgage loans being the largest contributor of the growth. Commercial real estate mortgage loans increased $79.7 million, or 6.2%, during 2018. Residential real estate mortgage loans increased $55.5 million, or 12.0%, during 2018. Commercial, industrial and agricultural loans increased $29.7 million, or 4.8%, in 2018. Real estate construction and land loans increased $15.6 million, or 14.5%, in 2018. Multi-family mortgage loans and\nPage -32-\ninstallment/consumer loans both decreased slightly during 2018. Fixed rate loans represented 23.9% and 24.3% of total loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the major classifications of loans at the dates indicated:\n\nSelected Loan Maturity Information\nThe following table sets forth the approximate maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates of certain loans, exclusive of real estate mortgage loans and installment/consumer loans to individuals as of December 31, 2018:\n\n (1) Included in the After Five Years\u201d column, are one-step construction loans that contain a preliminary construction period (interest only) that automatically converts to amortization at the end of the construction phase. \nPast Due, Non-accrual and Restructured Loans and Other Real Estate Owned\nThe following table sets forth selected information about past due, non-accrual, and restructured loans and other real estate owned:\n\n \nPage -33-\n\nThe following table sets forth individually impaired loans by loan classification:\n\nSecurities\nSecurities totaled $865.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $976.1 million at December 31, 2017, including restricted securities totaling $24.0 million at December 31, 2018 and $35.3 million at December 31, 2017. The available for sale portfolio decreased $79.0 million to $680.9 million from $759.9 million at December 31, 2017. Securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors. During 2018, the Company sold $238.3 million of securities available for sale compared to $52.4 million in 2017. The decrease in securities available for sale is primarily the result of a $93.4 million decrease in residential mortgage-backed securities, a $46.3 million decrease in state and municipal obligations, and a $27.8 million decrease in GSE securities, partially offset by a $50.4 million increase in residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and a $41.9 million increase in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations. Securities held to maturity decreased $20.7 million to $160.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $180.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in securities held to maturity is primarily the result of a $1.9 million decrease in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations, a $6.0 million decrease in residential collateralized mortgage obligations, a $7.2 million decrease in state and municipal obligations, and a $3.9 million decrease in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Fixed rate securities\nPage -34-\nrepresented 88.4% of total available for sale and held to maturity securities at December 31, 2018 compared to 87.5% at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the fair values, amortized costs, contractual maturities and approximate weighted average yields of the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios at December 31, 2018. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%.\n\nDeposits and Borrowings\nBorrowings, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and subordinated debentures, decreased $311.1 million to $319.8 million at December 31, 2018 from $630.9 million at December 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $551.9 million to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Individual, partnership and corporate ( core deposits\u201d) account balances increased $430.8 million and public funds and brokered deposits increased $121.1 million. The growth in deposits is attributable to increases in savings, NOW and money market deposits of $334.8 million, or 18.9%, to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase in demand deposits of $109.9 million, or 8.2%, to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018, and an increase in certificates of deposit of $107.1 million,\nPage -35-\nor 48.2%, to $329.5 million at December 31, 2018. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more increased $48.5 million, or 30.6%, from December 31, 2017 and other time deposits increased $58.6 million, or 91.9%, as compared to December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the remaining maturities of the Bank's time deposits at December 31, 2018:\n\nLiquidity\nThe objective of liquidity management is to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers, and to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities for Company growth or earnings enhancement. Liquidity management addresses the ability of the Company to meet financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments and deposit withdrawals, either on demand or on contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise.\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and dividend capabilities from the Bank. Cash available for distribution of dividends to shareholders of the Company is primarily derived from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. During 2018, the Bank paid $15.0 million in cash dividends to the Company. Prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the Bank's net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. As of January 1, 2019, the Bank had $51.4 million of retained net income available for dividends to the Company. In the event that the Company subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs. The Company did not make any capital contributions to the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Bank's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and investment securities principal repayments and maturities, lines of credit with other financial institutions including the FHLB and FRB, growth in core deposits and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered deposits. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing securities and short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit flows, loans, and asset and liability management objectives. Historically, the Bank has relied on its deposit base, drawn through its full-service branches that serve its market area and local municipal deposits, as its principal source of funding. The Bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers, while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its strategies.\nThe Bank's Asset/Liability and Funds Management Policy allows for wholesale borrowings of up to 25% of total assets. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had aggregate lines of credit of $373.0 million with unaffiliated correspondent banks to provide short-term credit for liquidity requirements. Of these aggregate lines of credit, $353.0 million is available on an unsecured basis. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had no overnight borrowings outstanding under these lines. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $50.0 million in overnight borrowings outstanding. The Bank also has the ability, as a member of the FHLB system, to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the Bank. The Bank also has a master repurchase agreement with the FHLB, which increases its borrowing capacity. As of December\nPage -36-\n31, 2018, the Bank had no FHLB overnight borrowings outstanding and $240.4 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $185.0 million in FHLB overnight borrowings and $316.4 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $0.5 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $0.9 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. In addition, the Bank has approved broker relationships for the purpose of issuing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $101.6 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposit and $150.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $44.9 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposits and $163.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts.\nLiquidity policies are established by senior management and reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors at least annually. Management continually monitors the liquidity position and believes that sufficient liquidity exists to meet all of the Company's operating requirements. The Bank's liquidity levels are affected by the use of short-term and wholesale borrowings and the amount of public funds in the deposit mix. Excess short-term liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sold or in an interest-earning account at the FRB.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations.\nThe following table presents contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2018:\n\nCommitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSome financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $65.8 million in outstanding loan commitments and $636.8 million in outstanding commitments for various lines of credit including unused overdraft lines. The Company also had $26.0 million of standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2018. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' equity increased to $453.8 million at December 31, 2018 from $429.2 million at December 31, 2017 as a result of undistributed net income, the shares of common stock issued under the DRP, and the stock-based compensation plan; partially offset by the declaration of dividends, and the net change in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, pension benefits, and cash flow hedges. The ratio of average stockholders' equity to average total assets was 10.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 10.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's capital strength is paralleled by the solid capital position of the Bank, as reflected in the excess of its regulatory capital ratios over the risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels required for classification as a well capitalized\u201d institution by the FDIC (see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Since 2013, the Company\nPage -37-\nhas actively managed its capital position in response to its growth. During this period, the Company has raised $261.2 million in capital through the following initiatives:\n \u00b7 On October 8, 2013, the Company completed a public offering with net proceeds of $37.6 million in capital from the sale of 1,926,250 shares of common stock. The purpose of the offering was in part to provide additional capital to Bridge Bancorp to support its acquisition of FNBNY and for general corporate purposes. \n \u00b7 On February 14, 2014, the Company issued 240,598 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $5.9 million in capital. These shares were issued directly in connection with the acquisition of FNBNY. \n \u00b7 On June 19, 2015, the Company issued 5,647,268 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $157.1 million in capital. These shares were issued in connection with the acquisition of CNB. \n \u00b7 On November 28, 2016, the Company completed a public offering with net proceeds of $47.5 million in capital from the sale of 1,613,000 shares of common stock. The purpose of the offering was in part to provide additional capital to Bridge Bancorp to support organic growth, the pursuit of strategic acquisition opportunities and other general corporate purposes, including contributing capital to Bank. \n \u00b7 Proceeds of $12.9 million in capital through issuance of common stock through the DRP. \nThe Company has the ability to issue additional common stock and/or preferred stock should the need arise under a shelf registration statement filed in April 2016.\nThe Company had returns on average equity of 8.66% and 4.64%, and returns on average assets of 0.87% and 0.49%, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company also utilizes cash dividends and stock repurchases to manage capital levels. In 2018, the Company declared four quarterly cash dividends totaling $18.3 million compared to four quarterly cash dividends of $18.2 million in 2017. The dividend payout ratios for 2018 and 2017 were 46.76% and 88.80%, respectively. The Company continues its trend of uninterrupted dividends. In March 2006, the Company approved its stock repurchase plan allowing the repurchase of up to 5% of its then current outstanding shares, 309,000 shares. The Company considers opportunities for stock repurchases carefully. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2018 and 2017. In February 2019, the Company announced the approval of a repurchase program for up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock, replacing the previous plan. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase plan.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or in the same magnitude, as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, which are\nPage -38-\nbeyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the FRB.\nImpact of Prospective Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion regarding the impact of new accounting

are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Net income for 2018 was $39.2 million, an increase of 91% compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, a lower provision for loan losses, and lower income tax expense. \n\n- Net interest income increased 7.6% to $136.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by organic loan growth and higher average yields on interest-earning assets. \n\n- The provision for loan losses decreased 87% to $1.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Net charge-offs also decreased in 2018.\n\n- Non-interest income decreased 36% to $11.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a $7.9 million net securities loss related to a balance sheet restructuring. \n\n- Non-interest expense increased 7.0% to $98.2 million in 2018 compared to 2017, largely due to a $8.9 million net fraud loss charge.\n\n- Total assets increased 6.1% to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, reflecting growth in loans and deposits. \n\n- The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.96% at December 31, 2018 compared to 1.02% at December 31, 2017.\n\n- The Company remains focused on growing loans and core deposits while managing interest rate risk. It continues to maintain a strong capital position to support growth."}
