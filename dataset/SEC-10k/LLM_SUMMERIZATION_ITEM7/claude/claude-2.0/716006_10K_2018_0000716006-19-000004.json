Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d MD&A\u201d, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See the introductory section immediately prior to Part I\u201d and Risk Factors in Item 1A\u201d of this report regarding these statements.\nOverview\nThis MD&A includes the following sections:\nOur Business: a brief description of our business and a discussion of how we assess our operating results\nConsolidated Results of Operations: an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nReporting Segment Results of Operations: an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for our two reporting segments: YRC Freight and Regional Transportation\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: an analysis of our results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nLiquidity and Capital Resources: a discussion of our major sources and uses of cash as well as an analysis of our cash flows and aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments\nOur Business\nYRC Worldwide is a holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers its customers a wide range of transportation services. YRC Worldwide has one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through its team of experienced service professionals, YRC Worldwide offers industry-leading expertise in heavyweight shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.\nWe measure the performance of our business both on a consolidated and reporting segment basis and using several metrics, but rely primarily upon (without limitation) operating revenue, operating income (loss), and operating ratio. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as secondary measures to assess our operating performance.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Revenue: Operating revenue has two primary components: volume (commonly evaluated using tonnage, tonnage per day, number of shipments, shipments per day or weight per shipment) and yield or price (commonly evaluated using picked up revenue, revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment). Yield includes fuel surcharge revenue which is common in the trucking industry and represents an amount charged to customers that adjusts with changing fuel prices. We base our fuel surcharges on the U.S. Department of Energy fuel index and adjust them weekly. Rapid material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or negatively impact our revenue and operating income as a result of changes in our fuel surcharge. We believe that fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing of our services to our customers. Without an industry accepted fuel surcharge program, our base pricing for our transportation services would require changes. We believe the distinction between base rates and fuel surcharge has blurred over time, and it is impractical to clearly separate all the different factors that influence the price that our customers are willing to pay. In general, under our present fuel surcharge program, we believe rising fuel costs are beneficial to us and falling fuel costs are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects of which are mitigated over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Income (Loss): Operating income (loss) is operating revenue less operating expenses. Consolidated operating income (loss) includes certain corporate charges that are not allocated to our reporting segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Ratio: Operating ratio is a common operating performance measure used in the trucking industry. It is calculated as (i) 100 percent (ii) minus the result of dividing operating income by operating revenue or (iii) plus the result of dividing operating loss by operating revenue, and is expressed as a percentage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense.

Adjusted EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects core operating performance, to measure compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facilities and to determine certain executive bonus compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenants in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as prescribed in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of key financial covenants.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have the following limitations:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt, letter of credit expenses, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to debt, or nonrecurring consulting fees, among other items;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the consolidated results of our reporting segments and unallocated corporate charges. A more detailed discussion of the operating results of our reporting segments is presented in the Reporting Segment Results of Operations\u201d section below.\nThe table below provides summary consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,092.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,891.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,697.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonoperating expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Due to the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, Operating income\u201d for prior years have been updated to reflect the reclassification of pension expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $201.0 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.\nOperating expenses increased $177.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $65.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $29.8 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $72.7 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a $52.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $6.9 million in facility related expense primarily due to increased rent expense at our leased terminal locations.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.7 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to a $35.8 million increase in vehicle rent expense, mostly related to a $32.9 million increase in long-term rental expense in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in local purchased transportation due to reduced usage.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in cargo claims expense.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.8 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $0.6 million in 2017. The gains in 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of an excess property at YRC Freight.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses decreased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an $11.2 million decrease in net periodic pension cost. Additionally, in 2017 we incurred $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments with no corresponding expense in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 35.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2018 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, foreign withholding taxes related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2018. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nIn July 2011, July 2013, and January 2014, we experienced significant changes in the ownership of our stock, as measured for Federal income tax purposes. These changes triggered the application of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code\u201d), which will likely have no substantial impact on the use of tax net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs\u201d) generated through January 31, 2014 and prior to offset future taxable income. While Section 382 changes may adversely affect cash flow, they have no impact on our current financial statements. The deferred tax assets resulting from the existing NOLs to which a Section 382 change applies are already fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Company adopted the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) regarding the public disclosures of certain accounting impacts of the Tax Act. In 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment date effects by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment date accounting for these effects. All provisional amounts have been finalized for the 2018 Form 10-K as required by SAB 118. This includes the federal and state income tax effects of newly enacted one-time transition tax. Such finalization had no net impact on the tax provision for 2018, as it merely adjusted net operating loss carry-forward amounts and was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $193.5 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved yield excluding fuel surcharge.\nOperating expenses increased $219.0 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, higher fuel costs, and a decrease in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $81.3 million, or 2.9%, due to a $44.8 million increase in wages and a $40.9 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, combined with an increase in shipping volumes, which required more employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $68.4 million, or 8.6%, primarily due to a $51.8 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $5.9 million in legal expenses primarily related to adverse legal developments at the Regional segment.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $73.9 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to a $28.1 million increase in vehicle rent expense, which consists of a $16.1 million increase in long-term rental expense due to higher usage of operating leases for revenue equipment and an $11.9 million increase in short-term rental expense resulting from equipment shortages. Additionally, rail purchased transportation expense increased $20.0 million primarily due to an increase in rail miles and higher rail rates, which is principally related to higher fuel surcharges, and local purchased transportation expense increased $15.1million primarily due to higher usage of third-party providers resulting from equipment shortages as well as increased rates per mile.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $6.5 million, or 2.6%, primarily due to a decrease of $8.4 million in our liability claims expense primarily due to favorable developments on our prior year outstanding claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $0.6 million in 2017 compared to net gains of $14.6 million in 2016. The gains in 2016 were primarily related to the sale of real properties.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses increased $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments, a $7.6 million non-union pension settlement charge recognized during 2017, a $4.9 million increase in foreign currency transaction losses, and a $2.8 million joint venture gain from JHJ International Transportation Co. ( JHJ\u201d) in 2016 with no corresponding gain in 2017.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 40.3% and 12.6%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2017 rate included a benefit recognized due to application of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), rules regarding intra-period tax allocation, a state provision, a foreign tax provision, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017. Significant items impacting the 2016 rate included a refund from a prior year amended return, a net state and foreign tax provision, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2016. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nReporting Segment Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our business using our two reporting segments:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services.

Operating expenses increased $105.1 million primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $21.3 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.1 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight. Additionally, workers' compensation expense decreased $6.1 million mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $51.7 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees increased by $21.0 million primarily due to increased management fees and other corporate service fees and non-recurring consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.0 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in vehicle rent expense of which $30.6 million was attributable to long-term rentals in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These costs were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in cargo claims expense, partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.2 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $2.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the sale of real properties. The 2018 gain includes a $29.3 million gain on the sale of an excess property.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,067.9 million in 2017, an increase of $109.0 million or 3.7% compared to 2016. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue, in volume, and improved yield excluding fuel surcharge.

Operating expenses increased $120.1 million primarily due to an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, higher fuel costs, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and a decrease in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $32.9 million, or 1.9%, primarily due to an $18.8 million increase in wages and an $18.8 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, combined with an increase in shipping volumes, which required more employee hours to process freight. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in salaries of $5.2 million due to headcount reductions.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $35.4 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to a $28.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis. Also, operating expenses increased by $7.6 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in hardware and software expenses.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.1 million, or 13.1%, primarily due to a $19.9 million increase in rail purchased transportation due to an increase in rail miles and higher rail rates which were impacted by increased fuel surcharges. Vehicle rent expense increased $17.3 million due to an $11.0 million increase in short-term rental expense resulting from equipment shortages as well as a $6.3 million increase in long-term expense driven by higher usage of operating leases for revenue equipment. Local purchased transportation expense increased $9.0 million due to higher usage of third-party providers resulting from equipment shortages as well as increased rates per mile.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $2.2 million in 2017 compared to net gains of $15.7 million in 2016, primarily due to the sale of real properties.\nRegional Transportation Results\nRegional Transportation represented 37% of consolidated operating revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $20.0 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to a $14.3 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.6 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in workers' compensation expense mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $43.1 million, or 12.2%, primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven. Additionally, vehicle maintenance expense increased $8.2 million primarily due to the timing of revenue equipment additions, and professional fees increased $3.8 million due to increased management and other corporate service fees.\nOther operating expenses.

any prospective net cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2018, our maximum availability under our ABL Facility was $39.2 million, which is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our $341.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Managed Accessibility was $1.2 million, which represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2018. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date of January 15, 2019. In January 2019, we had less than 10% of the borrowing line in eligible receivables and moved $25.0 million of cash into restricted cash, as permitted under the ABL Facility, which effectively put our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility to $203.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our availability under our ABL Facility was $68.9 million. Of the $68.9 million in availability, Managed Accessibility was $26.7 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility was $118.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe table below summarizes cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility for the years ended December 31:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: amounts placed into restricted cash subsequent to year-end\n</td> <td>(25.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our various multi-employer pension funds and single-employer pension plans, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and investments in capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Standard & Poor's Corporate Family Rating was B-\u201dwith a stable outlook and Moody's Investor Service Corporate Family Rating was B3\u201d with a positive outlook.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Term Loan Agreement governing our Term Loan has certain financial covenants, that, among other things, restrict certain capital expenditures and require us to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio covenant (defined as Consolidated Total Debt divided by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined below).\nOur total maximum leverage ratio covenants are as follows:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Four Consecutive Fiscal Quarters Ending\n</td> <td>Maximum Total\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> <td>Four Consecutive Fiscal Quarters Ending\n</td> <td>Maximum Total\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>June 30, 2020\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>September 30, 2020\n</td> <td>2.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>2.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2019\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>March 31, 2021\n</td> <td>2.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>June 30, 2021 and thereafter\n</td> <td>2.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to our Debt and Financing\u201d footnote of our consolidated financial statements for a description of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in our Term\nLoan Agreement, is the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. Our total leverage ratio for the four quarters ending December 31, 2018 was 2.64 to 1.00.\nWe believe that our results of operations will be sufficient to allow us to comply with the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement. We have improved our overall financial position as our nearest term maturity is now beyond 2020. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, improvements in operating results and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to allow us to fund our normal operations, increase working capital to support our planned revenue growth, and fund capital expenditures (and long-term leases, where applicable) for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and meet future stepped-up covenants beyond the next twelve months is dependent upon our ability to maintain operating results consistent with levels achieved during 2018. Maintaining results will depend on a number of factors including our ability to successfully negotiate a new labor agreement with our union employees as our current agreement is set to expire on March 31, 2019.\nCash Flow\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations increased by $164.1 million to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow is primarily related to $55.2 million in changes to accounts receivables from an improvement in days sales outstanding, and a $52.8 million decrease in minimum cash contributions for the non-union pension plans. Cash provided by operations also improved due to a $31.0 million increase in net income.\nCash flow from operations decreased by $43.1 million to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow is primarily related to a $27.5 million decrease in cash flow from net income (loss) and a $14.9 million decrease in cash flow related to changes in working capital.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $109.0 million in 2018 compared to $94.5 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs for revenue equipment. Partially offsetting this increase, net proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased $27.6 million mainly due to the sale of real properties. See a detailed discussion of 2018 and 2017 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nInvesting cash flow used $94.5 million in 2017 compared to $50.9 million of cash in 2016, primarily due to a net decrease in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $26.3 million, and cash flow in 2016 included $14.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of JHJ with no similar cash flow in 2017. See a detailed discussion of 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $33.9 million, which consists primarily of $31.9 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $96.2 million, which consists primarily of $79.3 million in repayments of our long-term debt, of which $61.9 million was in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments, as well as $14.5 million in debt issuance costs incurred during the year related to our financing transactions.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2016 was $73.2 million, which consists primarily of $70.7 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures focus primarily on the replacement of revenue equipment, investments in information technology and improvements to land and structures. Our business is capital intensive with significant investments in tractors, trailers, refurbished engines, and service center facilities. We determine the amount and timing of capital expenditures based on numerous factors, including fleet age, service center condition, viability of IT systems, anticipated liquidity levels, economic conditions, new or expanded services, regulatory actions and availability of financing.\nThe table below summarizes our actual net capital expenditures (proceeds) by type of investment for the years ended December 31:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and structures\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>145.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and structures\n</td> <td>(32.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total proceeds\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for revenue equipment were used primarily to fund the purchase of tractors and trailers and to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $198.5 million, with such payments to be made over an average lease term of 4 years with a capital equivalent value of $212.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, our operating lease obligations through 2030 totaled $429.2 million and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following sections provide aggregated information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018.\nNon-Union Pension Obligations\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The qualified plans, which include the Yellow Corporation Pension Plan, the Roadway LLC Pension Plan and the YRC Retirees Pension Plan (collectively held in the YRC Worldwide Inc. Master Pension Plans Trust or Trust\u201d) cover approximately 9,000 employees including those currently receiving benefits and those who have left the company with deferred benefits. On January 1, 2004, the existing qualified benefit plans were closed to new participants. On July 1, 2008, the benefit accrual for participants was frozen.\nIn 2015, we adopted the legislative changes provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( BBA 2015\u201d) which was signed into law on November 2, 2015. This legislation extends the use of longer-term, stabilized interest rate assumptions for measuring pension obligations under the minimum funding requirements. We expect to make the plan contributions as required by BBA 2015 and other regulations.\nDuring 2017, the Company amended the domestic qualified pension plans to provide for an automatic commencement of benefit at age 65, regardless of employment status. Additionally, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of\nlump sum benefit payments effective January 1, 2018. These amendments are consistent with the Company's continued long-term strategy of de-risking the qualified pension plans.\nDuring 2018, our net pension expense was $9.2 million. This amount included a $10.9 million expense recognition of settlements from lump sum payouts during the year. The non-cash settlement charge is reflected in nonoperating expenses as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. Our cash contributions were $15.2 million. Using our current plan assumptions, which include an assumed 7.0% return on assets and a discount rate of 4.44%, we expect to record income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe expect cash contributions for our non-union sponsored pension plans for the next five years to be as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Expected Cash Contributions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment strategy for our pension assets and our related pension contribution funding obligation includes an active interest rate hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on each plan's funded position. If the pension discount rate falls, our investment strategy is designed to significantly mitigate such interest rate risk to each pension plan's funded status and our contribution funding obligation. Conversely, if the pension discount rate rises, some portion of the beneficial impact of a rising discount rate on the pension liability will be forgone. The investment program is dynamic and the hedging program is designed to adapt to market conditions.\nIf future actual asset returns fall short of the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $10.1 million higher over the next five years. If future actual asset returns exceed the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $10.9 million lower over the next five years.\nIf future interest rates decrease 100 basis points from January 1, 2019 levels, total cash contributions would be $41.1 million lower over the next five years. This reflects our liability hedging strategy and the impact of BBA 2015 legislation. The liability hedging strategy results in additional asset returns from decreases in interest rates. However, BBA 2015 limits the increase in liabilities from lower interest rates such that the net effect is lower contributions. If interest rates increase 100 basis points from January 1, 2019 levels, total cash contributions would be $18.9 million higher over the next five years.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table reflects cash outflows that we are contractually obligated to make as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan(b)\n</td> <td>792.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing obligations(c)\n</td> <td>322.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension deferral obligations(d)\n</td> <td>96.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation and property damage and liability claims obligations(e)\n</td> <td>361.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(f)\n</td> <td>429.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual obligations(g)\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditure obligations(h)\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,084.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>581.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The ABL Facility includes future payments for the letter of credit fees and unused line fees and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>The Term Loan includes principal and interest payments, but excludes the unamortized discounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>The lease financing obligations include interest payments of $280.7 million and principal payments of $41.3 million.

purchases, letters of credit and surety bonds, which are reflected in the above tables.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of our financial statements requires accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments regarding the amounts included in the financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. We continually review the appropriateness of our accounting policies and the accuracy of our estimates including discussion with the Audit & Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors who make recommendations to management regarding these policies. Even with a thorough process, estimates must be adjusted based on changing circumstances and new information. Management has identified the policies described below as requiring significant judgment and having a potential material impact to our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves\nThe Company's revenues are derived from the transportation services we provide through the delivery of goods over the duration of a shipment. Upon receipt of the bill of lading, the contract existence criteria is met as evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement between two parties where collectability is probable, thus creating the distinct performance obligation. The Company has elected to expense initial direct costs as incurred because the average shipment cycle is less than one week.\nThe YRC Freight and Regional Transportation segments recognize revenue and substantially all the purchased transportation expense on a gross basis because we direct the use of the transportation service provided and remain responsible for the complete and proper shipment.\nInherent within our revenue recognition practices are estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. For the reserve for uncollectible accounts, we primarily use historical write-off experience but may also consider customer-specific factors, overall collection trends and economic conditions as part of our ongoing monitoring of credit. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $11.1 million and $12.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGiven the nature of our transportation services, future adjustments may arise which creates variability when establishing the transaction price used to recognize revenue. We have a high volume of performance obligations with similar characteristics, therefore we primarily use historical trends to arrive at estimated reserves. For rerate reserves, which are common for LTL carriers, we assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight and commodity verifications. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during subsequent periods. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $12.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively.\nFor shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and recognize delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements included deferred revenue as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $25.7 million and $28.1 million, respectively.\nSelf-Insurance for Claims\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for workers' compensation, property damage and liability claims, and cargo loss and damage. We measure the liabilities associated with workers' compensation and property damage and liability claims primarily through actuarial methods performed by an independent third party. Actuarial methods include estimates for the undiscounted liability for claims reported, for claims incurred but not reported and for certain future administrative costs. These estimates are based on historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim and the time required to settle claims. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Actual claims may vary from these estimates due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in healthcare costs, legal and judicial developments, and overall economic conditions. We discount the actuarial calculations of\nclaims liabilities for each calendar year to present value based on the average U.S. Treasury rate, during the calendar year of occurrence, for maturities that match the initial expected payout of the liabilities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $350.3 million and $360.7 million accrued for outstanding claims, respectively.\nPension\nEffective July 1, 2008, we froze our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for all participating employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Given the frozen status of the plans, the key estimates in determining pension cost are return on plan assets and discount rate, each of which are discussed below.\nReturn on Plan Assets\nThe assumption for expected return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of our portfolio performance that can impact our pension expense. With $874.9 million of plan assets for the YRC Worldwide funded pension plans, a 100-basis-point decrease in the assumption for expected rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $8.2 million and would have no effect on the underfunded pension liability reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018.\nWe believe our 2019 expected rate of return of 7.0% is appropriate based on our investment portfolio as well as a review of other objective indices. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>Target\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equities\n</td> <td>39.0%\n</td> <td>41.0%\n</td> <td>38.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities\n</td> <td>24.0%\n</td> <td>27.0%\n</td> <td>30.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Absolute Return\n</td> <td>37.0%\n</td> <td>32.0%\n</td> <td>32.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% effective for the 2018 and 2017 valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31, and impacts the following year's pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality non-callable bonds with interest payments and maturities generally consistent with our expected benefit payments.\nChanges in the discount rate can significantly impact our net pension liability. However, our liability hedging strategy mitigates this impact with changes in asset returns. A 100-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our underfunded pension liability by approximately $31.6 million. That same change would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately $4.4 million, driven by the return on assets. The discount rate can fluctuate considerably over periods depending on overall economic conditions that impact long-term corporate bond yields. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we used a discount rate to determine benefit obligations of 4.44% and 3.77%, respectively.\nGains and Losses\nGains and losses occur due to changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets from experience being different than assumed and from changes in assumptions. We recognize an amortization of the net gain or loss as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If an amortization is required, it equals the amount of net gain or loss that exceeds the ten percent corridor, amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the pension plans have net losses of $368.9 million and a projected benefit obligation of $1,073.2 million. The average remaining life expectancy of plan participants is approximately 21 years. For 2019, we expect to amortize approximately $11.9 million of the net loss. The comparable amortization amounts for 2018 and 2017 were $14.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2018, our plan assets included $536.8 million of investments that are measured at net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the fair value measurement and $44.3 million of Level 3 investments. Level 3 market values are based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the investment. These investments are subject to estimation to determine fair value which is used to determine components of our annual pension expense and the net liability.\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\nYRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn, contribute to 33 separate multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 78% of total YRC Worldwide employees). The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants.\nWe do not directly manage the multi-employer plans. Trustees, half of whom the respective union appoints and half of whom various contributing employers appoint, manage the trusts covering these plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements with the unions determine the amount of our contributions to these plans. We recognize as net pension expense the contractually required contribution for the respective period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.\nIn 2006, the Pension Protection Act ( PPA\u201d) became law and modified both the Code, as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the ERISA. The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. The funding status of these plans is determined by many factors.\nIn 2014, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA\u201d) became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans fail to:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>meet minimum funding requirements,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the PPA may require for certain of our underfunded plans,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwe could be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the PPA could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement.\nIf we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan's other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds. The Company does not believe that the temporary cessation of certain of its contributions to applicable multi-employer pension funds from the third quarter of 2009 through May 2011 will give rise to these excise taxes as we believe these contributions were not required for that period.\nDepending on the amount involved, a requirement to increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nFunded Status of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans and Contingent Withdrawal Liabilities\nThe plan administrators and trustees of multi-employer pension plans do not routinely provide us with current information regarding the funded status of the plans. Much of our information regarding the funded status has been (i) obtained from public filings using publicly available plan asset values, which are often dated, and (ii) based on the limited information available from plan administrators or trustees, which has not been independently validated.\nThe PPA provides that certain plans with a funded percentage of less than 65%, or that fail other tests, will be deemed to be in critical status. Plans in critical status must create a rehabilitation plan to exit critical status within periods that the PPA prescribes. The MPRA created a new zone status of Critical and Declining\u201d for plans facing insolvency. Based on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe many of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate, including, but not limited to, The Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund are in critical or critical and declining status. If the funding of the multi-employer pension plans does not reach certain goals (including those required not to enter endangered, critical status or critical and declining or those required by a plan's funding improvement or rehabilitation plan), our pension expenses could further increase.\nBased on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from all of the multi-employer pension plans would be an estimated $9 billion on a pre-tax basis. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to payment of material withdrawal obligations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine, based on the weight of evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision, or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss), unless affected by a specific intra-period allocation which happened in 2017 as described below. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries' earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.\nYRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740 to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.\nWhile the tax effect of net income (loss) before income taxes generally should be computed without regard to the tax effects of net income (loss) before income taxes from the other categories referenced in the preceding paragraph, an exception applies when there is a loss before income taxes and income from those other categories. In that situation, the appropriate tax provision is allocated to the other categories of earnings and a related tax benefit is recorded in net income (loss). This exception to the general rule applies even when a valuation allowance is in place at the beginning and end of the year. While intraperiod tax allocation does not change the overall tax provision, it may result in a gross-up of the individual components, thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category. In 2017, the Company met the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules, since it incurred a net loss before income taxes and income was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.3 million in income tax benefit (as reported on the statements of consolidated operations) and an offsetting tax expense of $13.3 million in total other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total income tax benefit did not change, and the total provision continued to be impacted by the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. There was no domestic deferred benefit recognized in 2018 or 2016, as the exception did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Through its team of experienced service professionals, YRC Worldwide offers industry-leading expertise in heavyweight shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.\nWe measure the performance of our business both on a consolidated and reporting segment basis and using several metrics, but rely primarily upon (without limitation) operating revenue, operating income (loss), and operating ratio. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as secondary measures to assess our operating performance.\n \u2022 Operating Revenue: Operating revenue has two primary components: volume (commonly evaluated using tonnage, tonnage per day, number of shipments, shipments per day or weight per shipment) and yield or price (commonly evaluated using picked up revenue, revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment). Yield includes fuel surcharge revenue which is common in the trucking industry and represents an amount charged to customers that adjusts with changing fuel prices. We base our fuel surcharges on the U.S. Department of Energy fuel index and adjust them weekly. Rapid material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or negatively impact our revenue and operating income as a result of changes in our fuel surcharge. We believe that fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing of our services to our customers. Without an industry accepted fuel surcharge program, our base pricing for our transportation services would require changes. We believe the distinction between base rates and fuel surcharge has blurred over time, and it is impractical to clearly separate all the different factors that influence the price that our customers are willing to pay. In general, under our present fuel surcharge program, we believe rising fuel costs are beneficial to us and falling fuel costs are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects of which are mitigated over time. \n \u2022 Operating Income (Loss): Operating income (loss) is operating revenue less operating expenses. Consolidated operating income (loss) includes certain corporate charges that are not allocated to our reporting segments. \n \u2022 Operating Ratio: Operating ratio is a common operating performance measure used in the trucking industry. It is calculated as (i) 100 percent (ii) minus the result of dividing operating income by operating revenue or (iii) plus the result of dividing operating loss by operating revenue, and is expressed as a percentage. \n \u2022 Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess the following: \n \u25e6 EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense. EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance. \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects EBITDA, and further adjusts for certain net gains or losses on property disposals, letter of credit expenses, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, permitted dispositions and discontinued operations, equity-based compensation expense, non-union pension settlement charges, and expenses associated with certain lump sum payments to our union employees, among other items, as defined in our credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects core operating performance, to measure compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facilities and to determine certain executive bonus compensation. \nWe believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenants in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as prescribed in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of key financial covenants.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have the following limitations:\n \u25e6 EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt; \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt, letter of credit expenses, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to debt, or nonrecurring consulting fees, among other items; \n \u25e6 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u25e6 Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and \n \u25e6 Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the consolidated results of our reporting segments and unallocated corporate charges. A more detailed discussion of the operating results of our reporting segments is presented in the Reporting Segment Results of Operations\u201d section below.\nThe table below provides summary consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,092.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,891.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,697.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonoperating expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Due to the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, Operating income\u201d for prior years have been updated to reflect the reclassification of pension expense. \n2018 Compared to 2017\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $201.0 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.\nOperating expenses increased $177.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $65.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $29.8 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $72.7 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a $52.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $6.9 million in facility related expense primarily due to increased rent expense at our leased terminal locations.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.7 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to a $35.8 million increase in vehicle rent expense, mostly related to a $32.9 million increase in long-term rental expense in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in local purchased transportation due to reduced usage.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in cargo claims expense.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.8 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $0.6 million in 2017. The gains in 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of an excess property at YRC Freight.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses decreased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an $11.2 million decrease in net periodic pension cost. Additionally, in 2017 we incurred $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments with no corresponding expense in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 35.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2018 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, foreign withholding taxes related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2018. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nIn July 2011, July 2013, and January 2014, we experienced significant changes in the ownership of our stock, as measured for Federal income tax purposes. These changes triggered the application of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code\u201d), which will likely have no substantial impact on the use of tax net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs\u201d) generated through January 31, 2014 and prior to offset future taxable income. While Section 382 changes may adversely affect cash flow, they have no impact on our current financial statements. The deferred tax assets resulting from the existing NOLs to which a Section 382 change applies are already fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Company adopted the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) regarding the public disclosures of certain accounting impacts of the Tax Act. In 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment date effects by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment date accounting for these effects. All provisional amounts have been finalized for the 2018 Form 10-K as required by SAB 118. This includes the federal and state income tax effects of newly enacted one-time transition tax. Such finalization had no net impact on the tax provision for 2018, as it merely adjusted net operating loss carry-forward amounts and was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $193.5 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved yield excluding fuel surcharge.\nOperating expenses increased $219.0 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, higher fuel costs, and a decrease in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $81.3 million, or 2.9%, due to a $44.8 million increase in wages and a $40.9 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, combined with an increase in shipping volumes, which required more employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $68.4 million, or 8.6%, primarily due to a $51.8 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $5.9 million in legal expenses primarily related to adverse legal developments at the Regional segment.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $73.9 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to a $28.1 million increase in vehicle rent expense, which consists of a $16.1 million increase in long-term rental expense due to higher usage of operating leases for revenue equipment and an $11.9 million increase in short-term rental expense resulting from equipment shortages. Additionally, rail purchased transportation expense increased $20.0 million primarily due to an increase in rail miles and higher rail rates, which is principally related to higher fuel surcharges, and local purchased transportation expense increased $15.1million primarily due to higher usage of third-party providers resulting from equipment shortages as well as increased rates per mile.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $6.5 million, or 2.6%, primarily due to a decrease of $8.4 million in our liability claims expense primarily due to favorable developments on our prior year outstanding claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $0.6 million in 2017 compared to net gains of $14.6 million in 2016. The gains in 2016 were primarily related to the sale of real properties.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses increased $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments, a $7.6 million non-union pension settlement charge recognized during 2017, a $4.9 million increase in foreign currency transaction losses, and a $2.8 million joint venture gain from JHJ International Transportation Co. ( JHJ\u201d) in 2016 with no corresponding gain in 2017.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 40.3% and 12.6%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2017 rate included a benefit recognized due to application of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), rules regarding intra-period tax allocation, a state provision, a foreign tax provision, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017. Significant items impacting the 2016 rate included a refund from a prior year amended return, a net state and foreign tax provision, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2016. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nReporting Segment Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our business using our two reporting segments:\n \u2022 YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services. YRC Freight provides for the movement of industrial, commercial and retail goods, primarily through centralized management. This reporting segment includes YRC Freight, our LTL subsidiary, YRC Reimer, a subsidiary located in Canada that specializes in shipments into, across and out of Canada, and HNRY Logistics, our logistics solutions provider. In addition to the United States and Canada, YRC Freight also serves parts of Mexico and Puerto Rico. \n \u2022 Regional Transportation is the reporting segment for our transportation service providers focused on business opportunities in the regional and next-day delivery markets. Regional Transportation is comprised of Holland, New Penn and Reddaway. These companies each provide regional, next-day ground services in their respective regions through a network of facilities located across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. \nYRC Freight Results\nYRC Freight represented 63% of our consolidated operating revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Operating expenses increased $105.1 million primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $21.3 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.1 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight. Additionally, workers' compensation expense decreased $6.1 million mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $51.7 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees increased by $21.0 million primarily due to increased management fees and other corporate service fees and non-recurring consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.0 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in vehicle rent expense of which $30.6 million was attributable to long-term rentals in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These costs were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in cargo claims expense, partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.2 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $2.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the sale of real properties. The 2018 gain includes a $29.3 million gain on the sale of an excess property.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,067.9 million in 2017, an increase of $109.0 million or 3.7% compared to 2016. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue, in volume, and improved yield excluding fuel surcharge.

Operating expenses increased $120.1 million primarily due to an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, higher fuel costs, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and a decrease in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $32.9 million, or 1.9%, primarily due to an $18.8 million increase in wages and an $18.8 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, combined with an increase in shipping volumes, which required more employee hours to process freight. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in salaries of $5.2 million due to headcount reductions.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $35.4 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to a $28.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis. Also, operating expenses increased by $7.6 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in hardware and software expenses.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.1 million, or 13.1%, primarily due to a $19.9 million increase in rail purchased transportation due to an increase in rail miles and higher rail rates which were impacted by increased fuel surcharges. Vehicle rent expense increased $17.3 million due to an $11.0 million increase in short-term rental expense resulting from equipment shortages as well as a $6.3 million increase in long-term expense driven by higher usage of operating leases for revenue equipment. Local purchased transportation expense increased $9.0 million due to higher usage of third-party providers resulting from equipment shortages as well as increased rates per mile.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $2.2 million in 2017 compared to net gains of $15.7 million in 2016, primarily due to the sale of real properties.\nRegional Transportation Results\nRegional Transportation represented 37% of consolidated operating revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Operating expenses increased $68.8 million primarily due to higher fuel costs, an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, and an increase in vehicle maintenance expense.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $20.0 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to a $14.3 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.6 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in workers' compensation expense mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $43.1 million, or 12.2%, primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven. Additionally, vehicle maintenance expense increased $8.2 million primarily due to the timing of revenue equipment additions, and professional fees increased $3.8 million due to increased management and other corporate service fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to an increase of $3.9 million increase in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims and a $1.5 million increase in cargo claims expense.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRegional Transportation reported operating revenue of $1,823.4 million for 2017, representing an increase of $84.1 million, or 4.8%, from 2016.

(d) Certain property gains are added back in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement which permits gains from the sale of excess property with continuing operations \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our ABL Facility and any prospective net cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2018, our maximum availability under our ABL Facility was $39.2 million, which is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our $341.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Managed Accessibility was $1.2 million, which represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2018. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date of January 15, 2019. In January 2019, we had less than 10% of the borrowing line in eligible receivables and moved $25.0 million of cash into restricted cash, as permitted under the ABL Facility, which effectively put our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility to $203.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our availability under our ABL Facility was $68.9 million. Of the $68.9 million in availability, Managed Accessibility was $26.7 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility was $118.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe table below summarizes cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility for the years ended December 31:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: amounts placed into restricted cash subsequent to year-end\n</td> <td>(25.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our various multi-employer pension funds and single-employer pension plans, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and investments in capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Standard & Poor's Corporate Family Rating was B-\u201dwith a stable outlook and Moody's Investor Service Corporate Family Rating was B3\u201d with a positive outlook.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Term Loan Agreement governing our Term Loan has certain financial covenants, that, among other things, restrict certain capital expenditures and require us to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio covenant (defined as Consolidated Total Debt divided by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined below).\nOur total maximum leverage ratio covenants are as follows:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Four Consecutive Fiscal Quarters Ending\n</td> <td>Maximum Total\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> <td>Four Consecutive Fiscal Quarters Ending\n</td> <td>Maximum Total\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>June 30, 2020\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>September 30, 2020\n</td> <td>2.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>2.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2019\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>March 31, 2021\n</td> <td>2.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>June 30, 2021 and thereafter\n</td> <td>2.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to our Debt and Financing\u201d footnote of our consolidated financial statements for a description of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in our Term\nLoan Agreement, is the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. Our total leverage ratio for the four quarters ending December 31, 2018 was 2.64 to 1.00.\nWe believe that our results of operations will be sufficient to allow us to comply with the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement. We have improved our overall financial position as our nearest term maturity is now beyond 2020. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, improvements in operating results and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to allow us to fund our normal operations, increase working capital to support our planned revenue growth, and fund capital expenditures (and long-term leases, where applicable) for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and meet future stepped-up covenants beyond the next twelve months is dependent upon our ability to maintain operating results consistent with levels achieved during 2018. Maintaining results will depend on a number of factors including our ability to successfully negotiate a new labor agreement with our union employees as our current agreement is set to expire on March 31, 2019.\nCash Flow\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations increased by $164.1 million to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow is primarily related to $55.2 million in changes to accounts receivables from an improvement in days sales outstanding, and a $52.8 million decrease in minimum cash contributions for the non-union pension plans. Cash provided by operations also improved due to a $31.0 million increase in net income.\nCash flow from operations decreased by $43.1 million to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow is primarily related to a $27.5 million decrease in cash flow from net income (loss) and a $14.9 million decrease in cash flow related to changes in working capital.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $109.0 million in 2018 compared to $94.5 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs for revenue equipment. Partially offsetting this increase, net proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased $27.6 million mainly due to the sale of real properties. See a detailed discussion of 2018 and 2017 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nInvesting cash flow used $94.5 million in 2017 compared to $50.9 million of cash in 2016, primarily due to a net decrease in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $26.3 million, and cash flow in 2016 included $14.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of JHJ with no similar cash flow in 2017. See a detailed discussion of 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $33.9 million, which consists primarily of $31.9 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $96.2 million, which consists primarily of $79.3 million in repayments of our long-term debt, of which $61.9 million was in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments, as well as $14.5 million in debt issuance costs incurred during the year related to our financing transactions.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2016 was $73.2 million, which consists primarily of $70.7 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures focus primarily on the replacement of revenue equipment, investments in information technology and improvements to land and structures. Our business is capital intensive with significant investments in tractors, trailers, refurbished engines, and service center facilities. We determine the amount and timing of capital expenditures based on numerous factors, including fleet age, service center condition, viability of IT systems, anticipated liquidity levels, economic conditions, new or expanded services, regulatory actions and availability of financing.\nThe table below summarizes our actual net capital expenditures (proceeds) by type of investment for the years ended December 31:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and structures\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>145.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and structures\n</td> <td>(32.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total proceeds\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for revenue equipment were used primarily to fund the purchase of tractors and trailers and to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $198.5 million, with such payments to be made over an average lease term of 4 years with a capital equivalent value of $212.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, our operating lease obligations through 2030 totaled $429.2 million and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following sections provide aggregated information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018.\nNon-Union Pension Obligations\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The qualified plans, which include the Yellow Corporation Pension Plan, the Roadway LLC Pension Plan and the YRC Retirees Pension Plan (collectively held in the YRC Worldwide Inc. Master Pension Plans Trust or Trust\u201d) cover approximately 9,000 employees including those currently receiving benefits and those who have left the company with deferred benefits. On January 1, 2004, the existing qualified benefit plans were closed to new participants. On July 1, 2008, the benefit accrual for participants was frozen.\nIn 2015, we adopted the legislative changes provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( BBA 2015\u201d) which was signed into law on November 2, 2015. This legislation extends the use of longer-term, stabilized interest rate assumptions for measuring pension obligations under the minimum funding requirements. We expect to make the plan contributions as required by BBA 2015 and other regulations.\nDuring 2017, the Company amended the domestic qualified pension plans to provide for an automatic commencement of benefit at age 65, regardless of employment status. Additionally, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of\nlump sum benefit payments effective January 1, 2018. These amendments are consistent with the Company's continued long-term strategy of de-risking the qualified pension plans.\nDuring 2018, our net pension expense was $9.2 million. This amount included a $10.9 million expense recognition of settlements from lump sum payouts during the year. The non-cash settlement charge is reflected in nonoperating expenses as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. Our cash contributions were $15.2 million. Using our current plan assumptions, which include an assumed 7.0% return on assets and a discount rate of 4.44%, we expect to record income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe expect cash contributions for our non-union sponsored pension plans for the next five years to be as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Expected Cash Contributions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment strategy for our pension assets and our related pension contribution funding obligation includes an active interest rate hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on each plan's funded position. If the pension discount rate falls, our investment strategy is designed to significantly mitigate such interest rate risk to each pension plan's funded status and our contribution funding obligation. Conversely, if the pension discount rate rises, some portion of the beneficial impact of a rising discount rate on the pension liability will be forgone. The investment program is dynamic and the hedging program is designed to adapt to market conditions.\nIf future actual asset returns fall short of the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $10.1 million higher over the next five years. If future actual asset returns exceed the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $10.9 million lower over the next five years.\nIf future interest rates decrease 100 basis points from January 1, 2019 levels, total cash contributions would be $41.1 million lower over the next five years. This reflects our liability hedging strategy and the impact of BBA 2015 legislation. The liability hedging strategy results in additional asset returns from decreases in interest rates. However, BBA 2015 limits the increase in liabilities from lower interest rates such that the net effect is lower contributions. If interest rates increase 100 basis points from January 1, 2019 levels, total cash contributions would be $18.9 million higher over the next five years.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table reflects cash outflows that we are contractually obligated to make as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan(b)\n</td> <td>792.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing obligations(c)\n</td> <td>322.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension deferral obligations(d)\n</td> <td>96.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation and property damage and liability claims obligations(e)\n</td> <td>361.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(f)\n</td> <td>429.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual obligations(g)\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditure obligations(h)\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,084.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>581.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) The ABL Facility includes future payments for the letter of credit fees and unused line fees and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \n (b) The Term Loan includes principal and interest payments, but excludes the unamortized discounts. \n (c) The lease financing obligations include interest payments of $280.7 million and principal payments of $41.3 million.

We continually review the appropriateness of our accounting policies and the accuracy of our estimates including discussion with the Audit & Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors who make recommendations to management regarding these policies. Even with a thorough process, estimates must be adjusted based on changing circumstances and new information. Management has identified the policies described below as requiring significant judgment and having a potential material impact to our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves\nThe Company's revenues are derived from the transportation services we provide through the delivery of goods over the duration of a shipment. Upon receipt of the bill of lading, the contract existence criteria is met as evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement between two parties where collectability is probable, thus creating the distinct performance obligation. The Company has elected to expense initial direct costs as incurred because the average shipment cycle is less than one week.\nThe YRC Freight and Regional Transportation segments recognize revenue and substantially all the purchased transportation expense on a gross basis because we direct the use of the transportation service provided and remain responsible for the complete and proper shipment.\nInherent within our revenue recognition practices are estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. For the reserve for uncollectible accounts, we primarily use historical write-off experience but may also consider customer-specific factors, overall collection trends and economic conditions as part of our ongoing monitoring of credit. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $11.1 million and $12.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGiven the nature of our transportation services, future adjustments may arise which creates variability when establishing the transaction price used to recognize revenue. We have a high volume of performance obligations with similar characteristics, therefore we primarily use historical trends to arrive at estimated reserves. For rerate reserves, which are common for LTL carriers, we assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight and commodity verifications. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during subsequent periods. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $12.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively.\nFor shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and recognize delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements included deferred revenue as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $25.7 million and $28.1 million, respectively.\nSelf-Insurance for Claims\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for workers' compensation, property damage and liability claims, and cargo loss and damage. We measure the liabilities associated with workers' compensation and property damage and liability claims primarily through actuarial methods performed by an independent third party. Actuarial methods include estimates for the undiscounted liability for claims reported, for claims incurred but not reported and for certain future administrative costs. These estimates are based on historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim and the time required to settle claims. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Actual claims may vary from these estimates due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in healthcare costs, legal and judicial developments, and overall economic conditions. We discount the actuarial calculations of\nclaims liabilities for each calendar year to present value based on the average U.S. Treasury rate, during the calendar year of occurrence, for maturities that match the initial expected payout of the liabilities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $350.3 million and $360.7 million accrued for outstanding claims, respectively.\nPension\nEffective July 1, 2008, we froze our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for all participating employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Given the frozen status of the plans, the key estimates in determining pension cost are return on plan assets and discount rate, each of which are discussed below.\nReturn on Plan Assets\nThe assumption for expected return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of our portfolio performance that can impact our pension expense. With $874.9 million of plan assets for the YRC Worldwide funded pension plans, a 100-basis-point decrease in the assumption for expected rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $8.2 million and would have no effect on the underfunded pension liability reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018.\nWe believe our 2019 expected rate of return of 7.0% is appropriate based on our investment portfolio as well as a review of other objective indices. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>Target\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equities\n</td> <td>39.0%\n</td> <td>41.0%\n</td> <td>38.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities\n</td> <td>24.0%\n</td> <td>27.0%\n</td> <td>30.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Absolute Return\n</td> <td>37.0%\n</td> <td>32.0%\n</td> <td>32.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% effective for the 2018 and 2017 valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31, and impacts the following year's pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality non-callable bonds with interest payments and maturities generally consistent with our expected benefit payments.\nChanges in the discount rate can significantly impact our net pension liability. However, our liability hedging strategy mitigates this impact with changes in asset returns. A 100-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our underfunded pension liability by approximately $31.6 million. That same change would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately $4.4 million, driven by the return on assets. The discount rate can fluctuate considerably over periods depending on overall economic conditions that impact long-term corporate bond yields. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we used a discount rate to determine benefit obligations of 4.44% and 3.77%, respectively.\nGains and Losses\nGains and losses occur due to changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets from experience being different than assumed and from changes in assumptions. We recognize an amortization of the net gain or loss as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If an amortization is required, it equals the amount of net gain or loss that exceeds the ten percent corridor, amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the pension plans have net losses of $368.9 million and a projected benefit obligation of $1,073.2 million. The average remaining life expectancy of plan participants is approximately 21 years. For 2019, we expect to amortize approximately $11.9 million of the net loss. The comparable amortization amounts for 2018 and 2017 were $14.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2018, our plan assets included $536.8 million of investments that are measured at net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the fair value measurement and $44.3 million of Level 3 investments. Level 3 market values are based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the investment. These investments are subject to estimation to determine fair value which is used to determine components of our annual pension expense and the net liability.\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\nYRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn, contribute to 33 separate multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 78% of total YRC Worldwide employees). The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants.\nWe do not directly manage the multi-employer plans. Trustees, half of whom the respective union appoints and half of whom various contributing employers appoint, manage the trusts covering these plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements with the unions determine the amount of our contributions to these plans. We recognize as net pension expense the contractually required contribution for the respective period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.\nIn 2006, the Pension Protection Act ( PPA\u201d) became law and modified both the Code, as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the ERISA. The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. The funding status of these plans is determined by many factors.\nIn 2014, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA\u201d) became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans fail to:\n \u2022 meet minimum funding requirements, \n \u2022 meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the PPA may require for certain of our underfunded plans, \n \u2022 obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or \n \u2022 reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met, \nwe could be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the PPA could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement.\nIf we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan's other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds. The Company does not believe that the temporary cessation of certain of its contributions to applicable multi-employer pension funds from the third quarter of 2009 through May 2011 will give rise to these excise taxes as we believe these contributions were not required for that period.\nDepending on the amount involved, a requirement to increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nFunded Status of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans and Contingent Withdrawal Liabilities\nThe plan administrators and trustees of multi-employer pension plans do not routinely provide us with current information regarding the funded status of the plans. Much of our information regarding the funded status has been (i) obtained from public filings using publicly available plan asset values, which are often dated, and (ii) based on the limited information available from plan administrators or trustees, which has not been independently validated.\nThe PPA provides that certain plans with a funded percentage of less than 65%, or that fail other tests, will be deemed to be in critical status. Plans in critical status must create a rehabilitation plan to exit critical status within periods that the PPA prescribes. The MPRA created a new zone status of Critical and Declining\u201d for plans facing insolvency. Based on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe many of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate, including, but not limited to, The Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund are in critical or critical and declining status. If the funding of the multi-employer pension plans does not reach certain goals (including those required not to enter endangered, critical status or critical and declining or those required by a plan's funding improvement or rehabilitation plan), our pension expenses could further increase.\nBased on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from all of the multi-employer pension plans would be an estimated $9 billion on a pre-tax basis. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to payment of material withdrawal obligations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine, based on the weight of evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision, or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss), unless affected by a specific intra-period allocation which happened in 2017 as described below. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries' earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.\nYRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740 to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.\nWhile the tax effect of net income (loss) before income taxes generally should be computed without regard to the tax effects of net income (loss) before income taxes from the other categories referenced in the preceding paragraph, an exception applies when there is a loss before income taxes and income from those other categories. In that situation, the appropriate tax provision is allocated to the other categories of earnings and a related tax benefit is recorded in net income (loss). This exception to the general rule applies even when a valuation allowance is in place at the beginning and end of the year. While intraperiod tax allocation does not change the overall tax provision, it may result in a gross-up of the individual components, thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category. In 2017, the Company met the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules, since it incurred a net loss before income taxes and income was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.3 million in income tax benefit (as reported on the statements of consolidated operations) and an offsetting tax expense of $13.3 million in total other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total income tax benefit did not change, and the total provision continued to be impacted by the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. There was no domestic deferred benefit recognized in 2018 or 2016, as the exception did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d MD&A\u201d, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See the introductory section immediately prior to Part I\u201d and Risk Factors in Item 1A\u201d of this report regarding these statements.\nOverview\nThis MD&A includes the following sections:\nOur Business: a brief description of our business and a discussion of how we assess our operating results\nConsolidated Results of Operations: an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nReporting Segment Results of Operations: an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for our two reporting segments: YRC Freight and Regional Transportation\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: an analysis of our results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nLiquidity and Capital Resources: a discussion of our major sources and uses of cash as well as an analysis of our cash flows and aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments\nOur Business\nYRC Worldwide is a holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers its customers a wide range of transportation services. YRC Worldwide has one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through its team of experienced service professionals, YRC Worldwide offers industry-leading expertise in heavyweight shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.\nWe measure the performance of our business both on a consolidated and reporting segment basis and using several metrics, but rely primarily upon (without limitation) operating revenue, operating income (loss), and operating ratio. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as secondary measures to assess our operating performance.\n \u2022 Operating Revenue: Operating revenue has two primary components: volume (commonly evaluated using tonnage, tonnage per day, number of shipments, shipments per day or weight per shipment) and yield or price (commonly evaluated using picked up revenue, revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment). Yield includes fuel surcharge revenue which is common in the trucking industry and represents an amount charged to customers that adjusts with changing fuel prices. We base our fuel surcharges on the U.S. Department of Energy fuel index and adjust them weekly. Rapid material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or negatively impact our revenue and operating income as a result of changes in our fuel surcharge. We believe that fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing of our services to our customers. Without an industry accepted fuel surcharge program, our base pricing for our transportation services would require changes. We believe the distinction between base rates and fuel surcharge has blurred over time, and it is impractical to clearly separate all the different factors that influence the price that our customers are willing to pay. In general, under our present fuel surcharge program, we believe rising fuel costs are beneficial to us and falling fuel costs are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects of which are mitigated over time. \n \u2022 Operating Income (Loss): Operating income (loss) is operating revenue less operating expenses. Consolidated operating income (loss) includes certain corporate charges that are not allocated to our reporting segments. \n \u2022 Operating Ratio: Operating ratio is a common operating performance measure used in the trucking industry. It is calculated as (i) 100 percent (ii) minus the result of dividing operating income by operating revenue or (iii) plus the result of dividing operating loss by operating revenue, and is expressed as a percentage. \n \u2022 Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess the following: \n \u25e6 EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense. EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance. \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects EBITDA, and further adjusts for certain net gains or losses on property disposals, letter of credit expenses, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, permitted dispositions and discontinued operations, equity-based compensation expense, non-union pension settlement charges, and expenses associated with certain lump sum payments to our union employees, among other items, as defined in our credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects core operating performance, to measure compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facilities and to determine certain executive bonus compensation. \nWe believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenants in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as prescribed in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of key financial covenants.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have the following limitations:\n \u25e6 EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt; \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt, letter of credit expenses, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to debt, or nonrecurring consulting fees, among other items; \n \u25e6 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u25e6 Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and \n \u25e6 Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the consolidated results of our reporting segments and unallocated corporate charges. A more detailed discussion of the operating results of our reporting segments is presented in the Reporting Segment Results of Operations\u201d section below.\nThe table below provides summary consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31:\n\n (a) Due to the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, Operating income\u201d for prior years have been updated to reflect the reclassification of pension expense. \n2018 Compared to 2017\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $201.0 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.\nOperating expenses increased $177.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $65.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $29.8 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $72.7 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a $52.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $6.9 million in facility related expense primarily due to increased rent expense at our leased terminal locations.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.7 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to a $35.8 million increase in vehicle rent expense, mostly related to a $32.9 million increase in long-term rental expense in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in local purchased transportation due to reduced usage.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in cargo claims expense.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.8 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $0.6 million in 2017. The gains in 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of an excess property at YRC Freight.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses decreased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an $11.2 million decrease in net periodic pension cost. Additionally, in 2017 we incurred $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments with no corresponding expense in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 35.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2018 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, foreign withholding taxes related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2018. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nIn July 2011, July 2013, and January 2014, we experienced significant changes in the ownership of our stock, as measured for Federal income tax purposes. These changes triggered the application of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code\u201d), which will likely have no substantial impact on the use of tax net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs\u201d) generated through January 31, 2014 and prior to offset future taxable income. While Section 382 changes may adversely affect cash flow, they have no impact on our current financial statements. The deferred tax assets resulting from the existing NOLs to which a Section 382 change applies are already fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Company adopted the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) regarding the public disclosures of certain accounting impacts of the Tax Act. In 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment date effects by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment date accounting for these effects. All provisional amounts have been finalized for the 2018 Form 10-K as required by SAB 118. This includes the federal and state income tax effects of newly enacted one-time transition tax. Such finalization had no net impact on the tax provision for 2018, as it merely adjusted net operating loss carry-forward amounts and was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $193.5 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved yield excluding fuel surcharge.\nOperating expenses increased $219.0 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, higher fuel costs, and a decrease in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $81.3 million, or 2.9%, due to a $44.8 million increase in wages and a $40.9 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, combined with an increase in shipping volumes, which required more employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $68.4 million, or 8.6%, primarily due to a $51.8 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $5.9 million in legal expenses primarily related to adverse legal developments at the Regional segment.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $73.9 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to a $28.1 million increase in vehicle rent expense, which consists of a $16.1 million increase in long-term rental expense due to higher usage of operating leases for revenue equipment and an $11.9 million increase in short-term rental expense resulting from equipment shortages. Additionally, rail purchased transportation expense increased $20.0 million primarily due to an increase in rail miles and higher rail rates, which is principally related to higher fuel surcharges, and local purchased transportation expense increased $15.1million primarily due to higher usage of third-party providers resulting from equipment shortages as well as increased rates per mile.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $6.5 million, or 2.6%, primarily due to a decrease of $8.4 million in our liability claims expense primarily due to favorable developments on our prior year outstanding claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $0.6 million in 2017 compared to net gains of $14.6 million in 2016. The gains in 2016 were primarily related to the sale of real properties.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses increased $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments, a $7.6 million non-union pension settlement charge recognized during 2017, a $4.9 million increase in foreign currency transaction losses, and a $2.8 million joint venture gain from JHJ International Transportation Co. ( JHJ\u201d) in 2016 with no corresponding gain in 2017.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 40.3% and 12.6%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2017 rate included a benefit recognized due to application of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), rules regarding intra-period tax allocation, a state provision, a foreign tax provision, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017. Significant items impacting the 2016 rate included a refund from a prior year amended return, a net state and foreign tax provision, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2016. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nReporting Segment Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our business using our two reporting segments:\n \u2022 YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services. YRC Freight provides for the movement of industrial, commercial and retail goods, primarily through centralized management. This reporting segment includes YRC Freight, our LTL subsidiary, YRC Reimer, a subsidiary located in Canada that specializes in shipments into, across and out of Canada, and HNRY Logistics, our logistics solutions provider. In addition to the United States and Canada, YRC Freight also serves parts of Mexico and Puerto Rico. \n \u2022 Regional Transportation is the reporting segment for our transportation service providers focused on business opportunities in the regional and next-day delivery markets. Regional Transportation is comprised of Holland, New Penn and Reddaway. These companies each provide regional, next-day ground services in their respective regions through a network of facilities located across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. \nYRC Freight Results\nYRC Freight represented 63% of our consolidated operating revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The table below provides summary financial information for YRC Freight for the years ended December 31:\n\n (a) pp represents the change in percentage points \n2018 Compared to 2017\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,197.3 million in 2018, an increase of $129.4 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in tonnage. The table below summarizes the key revenue metrics for the YRC Freight reporting segment for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n(a) Does not equal financial statement revenue due to revenue adjustments for shipments in transit and the impact of other revenue.\n(b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented.\nOperating income for YRC Freight was $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $24.3 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $105.1 million primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $21.3 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.1 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight. Additionally, workers' compensation expense decreased $6.1 million mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $51.7 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees increased by $21.0 million primarily due to increased management fees and other corporate service fees and non-recurring consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.0 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in vehicle rent expense of which $30.6 million was attributable to long-term rentals in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These costs were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in cargo claims expense, partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.2 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $2.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the sale of real properties. The 2018 gain includes a $29.3 million gain on the sale of an excess property.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,067.9 million in 2017, an increase of $109.0 million or 3.7% compared to 2016. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue, in volume, and improved yield excluding fuel surcharge. The table below summarizes the key revenue metrics for the YRC Freight reporting segment for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n(a) Does not equal financial statement revenue due to revenue adjustments for shipments in transit and the impact of other revenue.\n(b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented.\nOperating income for YRC Freight was $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $11.1 million from the same period in 2016. Operating expenses increased $120.1 million primarily due to an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, higher fuel costs, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and a decrease in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $32.9 million, or 1.9%, primarily due to an $18.8 million increase in wages and an $18.8 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, combined with an increase in shipping volumes, which required more employee hours to process freight. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in salaries of $5.2 million due to headcount reductions.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $35.4 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to a $28.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis. Also, operating expenses increased by $7.6 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in hardware and software expenses.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.1 million, or 13.1%, primarily due to a $19.9 million increase in rail purchased transportation due to an increase in rail miles and higher rail rates which were impacted by increased fuel surcharges.

Other operating expenses increased $4.7 million, or 5.3%, primarily due to an increase of $2.8 million in cargo claims expense and a $1.9 million increase in operating taxes, primarily due to more fuel gallons purchased.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs discussed in the Our Business\u201d section, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance. These measures should be considered in addition to the results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our GAAP financial measures. For segment Adjusted EBITDA, we present the reconciliation from operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA as it is consistent with how we measure performance.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA (defined in our Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\n (a) Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior year to conform to current year presentation \n (b) Certain property gains are added back in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement which permits gains from the sale of excess property with continuing operations \n (c) As required under our Term Loan Agreement, other, net, shown above consists of the impact of certain items to be included in Adjusted EBITDA \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following represents Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe reconciliation of operating income, by segment, to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\n\n\n (a) Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior year to conform to current year presentation \n (b) Due to the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, Operating income (loss)\u201d for prior years have been updated to reflect the reclassification of pension expense \n (c) As required under our Term Loan Agreement, other, net, shown above consists of the impact of certain items to be included in Adjusted EBITDA \n (d) Certain property gains are added back in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement which permits gains from the sale of excess property with continuing operations \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our ABL Facility and any prospective net cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2018, our maximum availability under our ABL Facility was $39.2 million, which is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our $341.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Managed Accessibility was $1.2 million, which represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2018. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date of January 15, 2019. In January 2019, we had less than 10% of the borrowing line in eligible receivables and moved $25.0 million of cash into restricted cash, as permitted under the ABL Facility, which effectively put our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility to $203.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our availability under our ABL Facility was $68.9 million. Of the $68.9 million in availability, Managed Accessibility was $26.7 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility was $118.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe table below summarizes cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility for the years ended December 31:\n\nOutside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our various multi-employer pension funds and single-employer pension plans, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and investments in capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Standard & Poor's Corporate Family Rating was B-\u201dwith a stable outlook and Moody's Investor Service Corporate Family Rating was B3\u201d with a positive outlook.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Term Loan Agreement governing our Term Loan has certain financial covenants, that, among other things, restrict certain capital expenditures and require us to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio covenant (defined as Consolidated Total Debt divided by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined below).\nOur total maximum leverage ratio covenants are as follows:\n\nRefer to our Debt and Financing\u201d footnote of our consolidated financial statements for a description of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in our Term\nLoan Agreement, is the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. Our total leverage ratio for the four quarters ending December 31, 2018 was 2.64 to 1.00.\nWe believe that our results of operations will be sufficient to allow us to comply with the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement. We have improved our overall financial position as our nearest term maturity is now beyond 2020. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, improvements in operating results and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to allow us to fund our normal operations, increase working capital to support our planned revenue growth, and fund capital expenditures (and long-term leases, where applicable) for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and meet future stepped-up covenants beyond the next twelve months is dependent upon our ability to maintain operating results consistent with levels achieved during 2018. Maintaining results will depend on a number of factors including our ability to successfully negotiate a new labor agreement with our union employees as our current agreement is set to expire on March 31, 2019.\nCash Flow\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations increased by $164.1 million to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow is primarily related to $55.2 million in changes to accounts receivables from an improvement in days sales outstanding, and a $52.8 million decrease in minimum cash contributions for the non-union pension plans. Cash provided by operations also improved due to a $31.0 million increase in net income.\nCash flow from operations decreased by $43.1 million to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow is primarily related to a $27.5 million decrease in cash flow from net income (loss) and a $14.9 million decrease in cash flow related to changes in working capital.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $109.0 million in 2018 compared to $94.5 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs for revenue equipment. Partially offsetting this increase, net proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased $27.6 million mainly due to the sale of real properties. See a detailed discussion of 2018 and 2017 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nInvesting cash flow used $94.5 million in 2017 compared to $50.9 million of cash in 2016, primarily due to a net decrease in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $26.3 million, and cash flow in 2016 included $14.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of JHJ with no similar cash flow in 2017. See a detailed discussion of 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $33.9 million, which consists primarily of $31.9 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $96.2 million, which consists primarily of $79.3 million in repayments of our long-term debt, of which $61.9 million was in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments, as well as $14.5 million in debt issuance costs incurred during the year related to our financing transactions.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2016 was $73.2 million, which consists primarily of $70.7 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures focus primarily on the replacement of revenue equipment, investments in information technology and improvements to land and structures. Our business is capital intensive with significant investments in tractors, trailers, refurbished engines, and service center facilities. We determine the amount and timing of capital expenditures based on numerous factors, including fleet age, service center condition, viability of IT systems, anticipated liquidity levels, economic conditions, new or expanded services, regulatory actions and availability of financing.\nThe table below summarizes our actual net capital expenditures (proceeds) by type of investment for the years ended December 31:\n\nOur capital expenditures for revenue equipment were used primarily to fund the purchase of tractors and trailers and to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $198.5 million, with such payments to be made over an average lease term of 4 years with a capital equivalent value of $212.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, our operating lease obligations through 2030 totaled $429.2 million and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following sections provide aggregated information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018.\nNon-Union Pension Obligations\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The qualified plans, which include the Yellow Corporation Pension Plan, the Roadway LLC Pension Plan and the YRC Retirees Pension Plan (collectively held in the YRC Worldwide Inc. Master Pension Plans Trust or Trust\u201d) cover approximately 9,000 employees including those currently receiving benefits and those who have left the company with deferred benefits. On January 1, 2004, the existing qualified benefit plans were closed to new participants. On July 1, 2008, the benefit accrual for participants was frozen.\nIn 2015, we adopted the legislative changes provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( BBA 2015\u201d) which was signed into law on November 2, 2015. This legislation extends the use of longer-term, stabilized interest rate assumptions for measuring pension obligations under the minimum funding requirements. We expect to make the plan contributions as required by BBA 2015 and other regulations.\nDuring 2017, the Company amended the domestic qualified pension plans to provide for an automatic commencement of benefit at age 65, regardless of employment status. Additionally, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of\nlump sum benefit payments effective January 1, 2018. These amendments are consistent with the Company's continued long-term strategy of de-risking the qualified pension plans.\nDuring 2018, our net pension expense was $9.2 million. This amount included a $10.9 million expense recognition of settlements from lump sum payouts during the year. The non-cash settlement charge is reflected in nonoperating expenses as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. Our cash contributions were $15.2 million. Using our current plan assumptions, which include an assumed 7.0% return on assets and a discount rate of 4.44%, we expect to record income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe expect cash contributions for our non-union sponsored pension plans for the next five years to be as follows:\n\nOur investment strategy for our pension assets and our related pension contribution funding obligation includes an active interest rate hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on each plan's funded position. If the pension discount rate falls, our investment strategy is designed to significantly mitigate such interest rate risk to each pension plan's funded status and our contribution funding obligation. Conversely, if the pension discount rate rises, some portion of the beneficial impact of a rising discount rate on the pension liability will be forgone. The investment program is dynamic and the hedging program is designed to adapt to market conditions.\nIf future actual asset returns fall short of the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $10.1 million higher over the next five years. If future actual asset returns exceed the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $10.9 million lower over the next five years.\nIf future interest rates decrease 100 basis points from January 1, 2019 levels, total cash contributions would be $41.1 million lower over the next five years. This reflects our liability hedging strategy and the impact of BBA 2015 legislation. The liability hedging strategy results in additional asset returns from decreases in interest rates. However, BBA 2015 limits the increase in liabilities from lower interest rates such that the net effect is lower contributions. If interest rates increase 100 basis points from January 1, 2019 levels, total cash contributions would be $18.9 million higher over the next five years.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table reflects cash outflows that we are contractually obligated to make as of December 31, 2018:\n\n (a) The ABL Facility includes future payments for the letter of credit fees and unused line fees and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \n (b) The Term Loan includes principal and interest payments, but excludes the unamortized discounts. \n (c) The lease financing obligations include interest payments of $280.7 million and principal payments of $41.3 million. The remaining principal obligation is offset by the estimated book value of leased property at the expiration date of each lease agreement. \n (d) Pension deferral obligations includes principal and interest payments on the Second A&R CDA. \n (e) The workers' compensation and property damage and liability claims obligations represent our estimate of future payments for these obligations, not all of which are contractually required. \n (f) Operating leases represent future payments, which include interest, under contractual lease arrangements primarily for revenue equipment and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \n (g) Other contractual obligations includes future service agreements and certain maintenance agreements and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \n (h) Capital expenditure obligations primarily includes noncancelable orders for revenue equipment leases not yet delivered, whereby the cash obligations will be scheduled over the multi-year term of the lease and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \nOther Commercial Commitments\nThe following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event, such as a need to borrow short-term funds due to insufficient cash flow.\n\n (a) Availability under the ABL Facility is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our outstanding letters of credit. \n (b) Letters of credit outstanding are generally required as collateral to support self-insurance programs and do not represent additional liabilities as the underlying self-insurance accruals are already included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Surety bonds are generally required for workers' compensation to support self-insurance programs, which include certain bonds that do not have an expiration date but are redeemable on demand, and do not represent additional liabilities as the underlying self-insurance accruals are already included in our consolidated balance sheets. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, other contractual obligations for service agreements and capital purchases, letters of credit and surety bonds, which are reflected in the above tables.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of our financial statements requires accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments regarding the amounts included in the financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. We continually review the appropriateness of our accounting policies and the accuracy of our estimates including discussion with the Audit & Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors who make recommendations to management regarding these policies. Even with a thorough process, estimates must be adjusted based on changing circumstances and new information. Management has identified the policies described below as requiring significant judgment and having a potential material impact to our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves\nThe Company's revenues are derived from the transportation services we provide through the delivery of goods over the duration of a shipment. Upon receipt of the bill of lading, the contract existence criteria is met as evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement between two parties where collectability is probable, thus creating the distinct performance obligation. The Company has elected to expense initial direct costs as incurred because the average shipment cycle is less than one week.\nThe YRC Freight and Regional Transportation segments recognize revenue and substantially all the purchased transportation expense on a gross basis because we direct the use of the transportation service provided and remain responsible for the complete and proper shipment.\nInherent within our revenue recognition practices are estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. For the reserve for uncollectible accounts, we primarily use historical write-off experience but may also consider customer-specific factors, overall collection trends and economic conditions as part of our ongoing monitoring of credit. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $11.1 million and $12.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGiven the nature of our transportation services, future adjustments may arise which creates variability when establishing the transaction price used to recognize revenue. We have a high volume of performance obligations with similar characteristics, therefore we primarily use historical trends to arrive at estimated reserves. For rerate reserves, which are common for LTL carriers, we assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight and commodity verifications. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during subsequent periods. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $12.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively.\nFor shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and recognize delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements included deferred revenue as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $25.7 million and $28.1 million, respectively.\nSelf-Insurance for Claims\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for workers' compensation, property damage and liability claims, and cargo loss and damage. We measure the liabilities associated with workers' compensation and property damage and liability claims primarily through actuarial methods performed by an independent third party. Actuarial methods include estimates for the undiscounted liability for claims reported, for claims incurred but not reported and for certain future administrative costs. These estimates are based on historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim and the time required to settle claims. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Actual claims may vary from these estimates due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in healthcare costs, legal and judicial developments, and overall economic conditions. We discount the actuarial calculations of\nclaims liabilities for each calendar year to present value based on the average U.S. Treasury rate, during the calendar year of occurrence, for maturities that match the initial expected payout of the liabilities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $350.3 million and $360.7 million accrued for outstanding claims, respectively.\nPension\nEffective July 1, 2008, we froze our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for all participating employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Given the frozen status of the plans, the key estimates in determining pension cost are return on plan assets and discount rate, each of which are discussed below.\nReturn on Plan Assets\nThe assumption for expected return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of our portfolio performance that can impact our pension expense. With $874.9 million of plan assets for the YRC Worldwide funded pension plans, a 100-basis-point decrease in the assumption for expected rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $8.2 million and would have no effect on the underfunded pension liability reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018.\nWe believe our 2019 expected rate of return of 7.0% is appropriate based on our investment portfolio as well as a review of other objective indices. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:\n\nBased on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% effective for the 2018 and 2017 valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31, and impacts the following year's pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality non-callable bonds with interest payments and maturities generally consistent with our expected benefit payments.\nChanges in the discount rate can significantly impact our net pension liability. However, our liability hedging strategy mitigates this impact with changes in asset returns. A 100-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our underfunded pension liability by approximately $31.6 million. That same change would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately $4.4 million, driven by the return on assets. The discount rate can fluctuate considerably over periods depending on overall economic conditions that impact long-term corporate bond yields. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we used a discount rate to determine benefit obligations of 4.44% and 3.77%, respectively.\nGains and Losses\nGains and losses occur due to changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets from experience being different than assumed and from changes in assumptions. We recognize an amortization of the net gain or loss as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If an amortization is required, it equals the amount of net gain or loss that exceeds the ten percent corridor, amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the pension plans have net losses of $368.9 million and a projected benefit obligation of $1,073.2 million. The average remaining life expectancy of plan participants is approximately 21 years. For 2019, we expect to amortize approximately $11.9 million of the net loss. The comparable amortization amounts for 2018 and 2017 were $14.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2018, our plan assets included $536.8 million of investments that are measured at net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the fair value measurement and $44.3 million of Level 3 investments. Level 3 market values are based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the investment. These investments are subject to estimation to determine fair value which is used to determine components of our annual pension expense and the net liability.\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\nYRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn, contribute to 33 separate multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 78% of total YRC Worldwide employees). The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants.\nWe do not directly manage the multi-employer plans. Trustees, half of whom the respective union appoints and half of whom various contributing employers appoint, manage the trusts covering these plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements with the unions determine the amount of our contributions to these plans. We recognize as net pension expense the contractually required contribution for the respective period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.\nIn 2006, the Pension Protection Act ( PPA\u201d) became law and modified both the Code, as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the ERISA. The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. The funding status of these plans is determined by many factors.\nIn 2014, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA\u201d) became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans fail to:\n \u2022 meet minimum funding requirements, \n \u2022 meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the PPA may require for certain of our underfunded plans, \n \u2022 obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or \n \u2022 reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met, \nwe could be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the PPA could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement.\nIf we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan's other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds. The Company does not believe that the temporary cessation of certain of its contributions to applicable multi-employer pension funds from the third quarter of 2009 through May 2011 will give rise to these excise taxes as we believe these contributions were not required for that period.\nDepending on the amount involved, a requirement to increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nFunded Status of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans and Contingent Withdrawal Liabilities\nThe plan administrators and trustees of multi-employer pension plans do not routinely provide us with current information regarding the funded status of the plans. Much of our information regarding the funded status has been (i) obtained from public filings using publicly available plan asset values, which are often dated, and (ii) based on the limited information available from plan administrators or trustees, which has not been independently validated.\nThe PPA provides that certain plans with a funded percentage of less than 65%, or that fail other tests, will be deemed to be in critical status. Plans in critical status must create a rehabilitation plan to exit critical status within periods that the PPA prescribes. The MPRA created a new zone status of Critical and Declining\u201d for plans facing insolvency. Based on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe many of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate, including, but not limited to, The Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund are in critical or critical and declining status. If the funding of the multi-employer pension plans does not reach certain goals (including those required not to enter endangered, critical status or critical and declining or those required by a plan's funding improvement or rehabilitation plan), our pension expenses could further increase.\nBased on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from all of the multi-employer pension plans would be an estimated $9 billion on a pre-tax basis. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to payment of material withdrawal obligations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine, based on the weight of evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision, or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss), unless affected by a specific intra-period allocation which happened in 2017 as described below. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries' earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.\nYRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740 to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.\nWhile the tax effect of net income (loss) before income taxes generally should be computed without regard to the tax effects of net income (loss) before income taxes from the other categories referenced in the preceding paragraph, an exception applies when there is a loss before income taxes and income from those other categories. In that situation, the appropriate tax provision is allocated to the other categories of earnings and a related tax benefit is recorded in net income (loss). This exception to the general rule applies even when a valuation allowance is in place at the beginning and end of the year. While intraperiod tax allocation does not change the overall tax provision, it may result in a gross-up of the individual components, thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category. In 2017, the Company met the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules, since it incurred a net loss before income taxes and income was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.3 million in income tax benefit (as reported on the statements of consolidated operations) and an offsetting tax expense of $13.3 million in total other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total income tax benefit did not change, and the total provision continued to be impacted by the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. There was no domestic deferred benefit recognized in 2018 or 2016, as the exception did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance.", "item_7_tables": "Table 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

driven by higher base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by lower tonnage. Operating income increased 20.1%.\n\n- Net pension expense was $9.2 million in 2018. Expected pension contributions over the next 5 years range from $9.9 million to $42.9 million per year. \n\n- At December 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $227.6 million. Managed Accessibility under the ABL Facility was $1.2 million after moving $25 million to restricted cash. \n\n- The company has a Term Loan with principal outstanding of $792.5 million. The Term Loan has a maximum total leverage ratio covenant that steps down over time, reaching 2.50x by mid-2021. \n\n- The company operates two reporting segments: YRC Freight (63% of revenue) and Regional Transportation (37% of revenue). Both segments showed revenue growth in 2018 driven by higher base yield and fuel surcharges.\n\n- The company participates in 33 multi-employer pension plans. Several plans are in critical or declining status. Withdrawal liability is estimated at $9 billion if the company were to fully withdraw.\n\n- Critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, self-insurance claims liabilities, pension assumptions, and income taxes. Changes in these estimates can significantly impact results."}
