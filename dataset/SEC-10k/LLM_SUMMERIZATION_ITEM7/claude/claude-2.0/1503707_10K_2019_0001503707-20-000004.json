Resident fee income from our senior housing operating facilities is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges and other resident charges. Rental income is generated from our real estate for the leasing of space to various types of healthcare operators/tenants/residents. Net interest income is generated from our debt investment. Additionally, we report our proportionate interest of revenues and expenses from unconsolidated joint ventures, which own healthcare real estate, through equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures on our consolidated statements of operations.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\u201d for a description of these metrics) to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business.\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nInvesting in and lending to the healthcare real estate sector requires an in-depth understanding of the specialized nature of healthcare facility operations and the healthcare regulatory environment. While these competitive constraints may create opportunities for attractive investments in the healthcare property sector, they may also provide challenges and risks when seeking attractive terms for our investments.\nWe believe owners and operators of senior housing facilities and other healthcare properties may benefit from demographic and economic trends, specifically the aging of the United States population whereby Americans aged 65 years old and older are expected to increase from 49.2 million in 2016 to 78.0 million in 2035 (source: U.S. Census Bureau 2017 National Population Projections), and the increasing demand for care for seniors outside of their homes. As a result of these demographic trends, we expect healthcare costs to increase at a faster rate than the available funding from both private sources and government-sponsored healthcare programs. Healthcare spending in the U.S. is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.5% over the next 10 years and increase from $3.6 trillion in 2018 to $6.0 trillion in 2027 (source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS). As healthcare costs increase, insurers, individuals and the U.S. government are pursuing lower cost options for healthcare. Senior housing facilities, such as ALFs, MCFs, SNFs and ILFs, are generally more cost effective than higher acuity healthcare settings, such as short or long-term acute-care hospitals, in-patient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. The growth in total demand for healthcare, cost constraints, new regulations, broad U.S. demographic changes and the shift towards cost effective community-based settings is resulting in dynamic changes to the healthcare delivery system.\nNotwithstanding the growth in the industry and demographics, economic and healthcare market uncertainty has had a negative impact, weakening the market's fundamentals and ultimately reducing tenants/operators' ability to make rent payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the respective leases, as well as reduced income for our operating investments. In addition, increased development and competitive pressures has had an impact on some of our assets. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the industry seniors housing occupancy averaged 88.0%, which was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2019 (source: The National Investment Centers for Senior Housing & Care, or NIC). Overall, occupancy has declined or remained flat in 14 of the last 16 quarters (source: NIC). Seniors housing under construction as a share of inventory remains high, however has now declined to 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a peak of 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 (source: NIC). Further, a tight labor market and competition to attract quality staff continues to drive increased wages and personnel costs, resulting in lower margins. To the extent that occupancy and market rental rates decline, property-level cash flow could be negatively affected and decreased cash flow, in turn, is expected to impact the value of underlying properties.\nFurther third-party payor rules and regulatory changes that are being implemented by the federal and even some state governments and commercial payors to improve quality of care and control healthcare spending may continue to affect reimbursement and increase operating costs to our operators and tenants. We continue to monitor reimbursement program requirements and assess the potential impact that changes in the political environment may have on such programs and the ability of our tenants/operators to meet their payment obligations.\nOur SNF operators receive a majority of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to SNFs could have a material impact on a SNF operator's liquidity and financial condition. SNF operators are currently facing various operational, reimbursement, legal and regulatory challenges due to, among other things, increased wages and labor costs, narrowing of referral networks, shorter lengths of stay, staffing shortages, expenses associated with increased government investigations, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose pricing pressures and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, which could result in lower daily reimbursement rates, lower lease coverage, decreased occupancies and declining operating margins.\nDespite the barriers and constraints to investing in the senior housing sector, demographic and other market dynamics continue to attract investors and capital to the sector. The supply and demand fundamentals that are driven by the increasing need for healthcare services by an aging population have created investment opportunities for investors and thus acquisition activity within the sector continues to be strong.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. For critical accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nImpairment\nOur investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstance, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant/operator/resident receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenant/operator/resident to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future operator/tenant credit losses on unbilled rents receivable based upon an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment losses totaling $27.6 million for our direct investments and held for sale investments. The impairment recognized in 2019 includes:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rochester portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $19.5 million for two ALFs with continuing poor performance and sustained declines in occupancy as a result of difficult market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Kansas City portfolio.

Impairment losses totaling $4.1 million for two net lease facilities, for which the tenant has sustained operating losses and has failed to remit rental payments during the year. One of the facilities was designated as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2018 and has been impaired to its estimated fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairment losses totaling $31.0 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of December 31, 2019. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A, for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our unconsolidated ventures have recorded impairments and reserves, which have been recognized through our equity in earnings (losses). The impairment and reserves recorded in 2019 include:\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Griffin-American Joint Venture. Impairment losses for operating real estate and held for sale assets, of which our proportionate share totaled $1.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Eclipse Joint Venture.

Impairment losses for a net lease SNF, of which our proportionate share totaled $0.5 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We will continue to monitor the performance of, and actively manage, all of our investments. However, there can be no assurance that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the governing documents or underwriting and we may, in the future, record impairment, as appropriate and if required.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resident fee income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,976\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property and other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,093\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on debt investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on mortgage loans held in a securitized trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on mortgage obligations issued by a securitization trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,328\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate properties -

Further, rental income recorded in 2018 was reduced by one-time write-downs, as a result of a net lease tenant not remitting rental payments, which also contributed to the variance. Increases to rental income were offset by the sale of two net lease properties sold within the Peregrine portfolio.\nOther Revenue\nAs a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, non-recurring services and fees at our operating facilities were reclassified into rental and resident fee income, which resulted in a decrease to other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was offset by non-recurring service provider incentives recognized by the Winterfell portfolio, as well as interest earned on uninvested cash.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased $1.3 million primarily as a result of the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in the first quarter of 2018.\nExpenses\nReal Estate Properties - Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (placed in service - 2017 and prior)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AL/MC/CCRC properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IL properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties placed in service - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,026\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty operating expenses decreased $7.5 million, primarily due to the sale of an operating facility in the Fountains portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as expense savings realized in the Winterfell portfolio.

Securitization trust expenses were primarily comprised of fees paid to Freddie Mac, the original issuer, as guarantor of the interest and principal payments related to the investment grade securitization bonds.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 are primarily a result of the residual costs incurred for the Winterfell and Avamere operator transition. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 are primarily the result of the Rochester portfolio acquisition, which closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nAsset Management and Other Fees - Related Party\nAsset management and other fees - related party decreased $18.5 million primarily as a result of the December 2017 amendment to the advisory agreement which became effective during the first quarter of 2018. The amended advisory agreement reduced the monthly asset management fee and eliminated acquisition fees paid to our Advisor.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, primarily as a result of higher direct corporate expenses, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, partially offset by lower corporate overhead costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (placed in service - 2016 and prior)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AL/MC/CCRC properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IL properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties placed in service - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties placed in service - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $1.7 million, primarily as a result of real estate portfolios acquired during 2017 and capital improvements funded on same store portfolios.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment losses totaling $36.3 million were recorded due to performance issues at properties within the Winterfell, Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios, as well as to reflect net realizable value of properties designated as held for sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, impairment loss of $5.0 million was recorded a facility within the Peregrine net lease portfolio, due to deteriorating operating results of the tenant.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Mortgage Loans Held in Securitization Trust, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, unrealized gain of $1.5 million on senior housing mortgage loans and debt held in a securitization trust represents the change in the fair value of the consolidated assets and liabilities of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization.

The liability extinguishment gain and the loan loss reserve totaled $14.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively.\nEquity in earnings, net of select revenues and expenses, decreased $8.5 million primarily due to the Espresso portfolio, which has experienced three operator transitions, resulting in a decrease in rental income.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $114,000 and related to our operating properties, which operate through a taxable REIT subsidiary structure. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current principal liquidity needs are to fund: (i) principal and interest payments on our borrowings and other commitments; (ii) operating expenses; (iii) capital expenditures, development and redevelopment activities, including capital calls in connection with our unconsolidated joint venture investments; and (iv) repurchases of our shares.\nOur current primary sources of liquidity include the following: (i) cash on hand; (ii) cash flow generated by our investments, both from our operating activities and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures; (iii) secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, including investment-level financing and/or a corporate credit facility; and (iv) proceeds from full or partial realization of investments.\nOur investments generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, resident fees and interest income, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments, capital expenditures and corporate general and administrative expenses. Our business continues to be impacted by limited growth in revenues due to stagnant occupancy and rate pressures as well as rising labor and benefits costs, resulting in compressed operating margins. Our debt service obligations have also increased over the same period, primarily due to increased recurring principal amortization. At the same time, we believe we need to continue to invest capital into our properties in order to maintain market position, as well as functional and operating standards, or to add value to our properties. As a result, our board of directors has suspended distributions and limited share repurchases, as described in further detail below, in order to maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility to support the execution of our strategic objectives and drive long-term value for stockholders.\nWe currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. For additional information regarding our liquidity needs and capital resources, see below. As of March 19, 2020, we had approximately $39.6 million of unrestricted cash.\nCash From Operations\nWe primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties, rental income from our net leased properties and interest from our debt investment, as well as distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nA substantial majority of our properties, or 79.0% of our operating real estate, excluding our unconsolidated ventures and properties designated held for sale, are operating properties whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash flow from operations continues to be negatively impacted by, among other things, suboptimal occupancy levels, rate pressures, increased labor and benefits costs, as well as rising real estate taxes.\nIn addition, we have significant joint ventures and may not be able to control the timing of distributions, if any, from these investments. As of December 31, 2019, our unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures represented 35.2% and 20.8%, respectively, of our total real estate equity investments, based on cost.\nBorrowings\nWe use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy and are required to make recurring principal and interest payments on our borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding. During year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $22.9 million and $64.2 million in recurring principal and interest payments, respectively, on these borrowings. We currently anticipate that both recurring principal and interest payments will remain consistent in 2020.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures also have significant asset level borrowings. In June 2019, our Griffin-American joint venture completed the refinancing of its prior $1.7 billion consolidated healthcare loan maturing in December 2019. The new interest-only loan totals $1.5 billion with a five-year term, inclusive of extension options. The collateral package for the new loan includes 158 U.S. healthcare properties, but excludes certain assets that were collateral for the previous loan. We have contributed our proportionate share of additional equity to the joint venture to complete the refinancing, which totaled approximately $37.4 million, however, the $16.9 million net proceeds received from the sale of three unencumbered properties within the joint venture effectively decreased the equity contribution required to complete the refinancing.\nIn addition, our Sponsor Line provides a revolving line of credit for up to $35.0 million. We have not drawn on our Sponsor Line in 2019 and currently have no borrowings outstanding under our Sponsor Line.\nOur charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any securitized mortgage obligations to third parties, is 75.0% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non- cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage was 60.7% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2019, indirect leverage on assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, held through our unconsolidated joint ventures was 63.2%.\nAlthough no significant consolidated borrowings mature in 2020 or 2021, $466.5 million of mortgage notes payable secured by the Watermark Fountains net lease and operating portfolios matures in June 2022, which may require capital to be funded if favorable refinancing is not obtained.\nFor additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Note 6, Borrowings\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCapital Expenditures, Development and Redevelopment Activities\nWe are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and, from time to time, may also fund capital expenditures for certain net leased properties. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position, as well as functional and operating standards. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $22.3 million on capital expenditures for our direct investments. In addition, we will continue to execute on and identify strategic development opportunities for our existing investments that may involve replacing, converting or renovating facilities in our portfolio which, in turn, would allow us to provide an optimal mix of services, increase operating income, achieve property stabilization and enhance the overall value of our assets.\nWe are also party to certain agreements that contemplate development of healthcare properties funded by us and our joint venture partners. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences under our joint venture governing documents for any such failure to fund.\nDisposition of Investments\nWe also evaluate dispositions of non-core investments to provide an additional source of liquidity. In 2019, we generated total net proceeds, after mortgage and loan repayments, of $26.6 million from dispositions of our direct investments and investments within our unconsolidated ventures. Refer to -2019 Significant Developments\u201d for additional details. We will continue to evaluate and expect additional dispositions of investments in 2020.\nWe have made significant investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties which we may share decision-making authority regarding certain major decisions and could prevent us from selling properties or our interest in the joint venture.\nFurther, our $74.2 million mezzanine loan debt investment matures January 2021. If the borrower is not able to refinance with another lender or otherwise repay the principal amount at its stated maturity, we may have to negotiate modifications to the loan agreement, which may delay our ability to realize liquidity from this investment.\nDistributions\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated, and continue to generate, net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity. Refer to Distributions Declared and Paid\u201d for further information regarding our historical distributions.\nRepurchases\nWe have adopted a Share Repurchase Program effective August 7, 2012, as most recently amended in October 2018, which enables stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. In October 2018, our board of directors approved an amended and restated Share Repurchase Program, under which we will only repurchase shares in connection with the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. However, our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate amount of $10.7 million. Refer to Note 9, Stockholders' Equity\u201d and Note 15, Subsequent Events\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOther Commitments\nWe expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, pursuant to our advisory agreement, as applicable, in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. In December 2017, our advisory agreement was amended with changes to the asset management and acquisition fee structure. We renewed our advisory agreement with our Advisor on June 30, 2019 for an additional one-year term on terms identical to those previously in effect. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for further information regarding our advisory fees.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,287\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(314,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,235\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(220,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(171,404\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the timing of property operating expense payments, which resulted in our operating properties having lower accounts payable and accrued expense balances as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Lower interest income due to the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in March 2018 also contributed to the variance.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund investment improvements and acquisitions, net of any investment dispositions. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily the Griffin-American capital contribution funded in June 2019 and additional capital improvements to existing investments, partially offset by the proceeds from the Peregrine properties sale and distributions received from our investment in unconsolidated ventures. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the sale of an ownership interest in the Trilogy joint venture and the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization, partially offset by additional capital improvements to existing investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding capital expenditures made at our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,382\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total improvement of operating real estate investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock and changes in our mortgage notes payable. Cash flows used in financing activities was $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash used of $31.2 million was primarily attributable to the suspension of dividends in February 2019 and amended share repurchase program in October 2018, partially offset by the Peregrine portfolio mortgage repayment in May 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $17.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in asset management and acquisition fees paid to our Advisor.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund investment improvements and acquisitions, net of any investment dispositions. Net cash provided by investing activities was $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash used of $314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 are primarily attributable to the sale of an ownership interest in the Trilogy joint venture and the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization, partially offset by additional capital improvements to existing investments. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relate to the acquisition of three operating real estate portfolios and additional capital contributions to our unconsolidated ventures.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital improvements during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding capital improvements made at our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total improvement of operating real estate investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock and changes in our mortgage notes payable.

We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Part II. Item 8.

As a result, interest rates and other factors may influence our performance. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases allow for annual rent increases based on the greater of certain percentages or increase in the relevant consumer price index. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our healthcare properties.\nRefer to", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8.

Risk Factors.\u201d References to we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nIntroduction\nWe have invested in independent living facilities, or ILFs, assisted living facilities, or ALFs, memory care facilities, or MCFs, continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, which we collectively refer to as senior housing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, medical office buildings, or MOBs, and hospitals.\nOur primary investment segments are as follows:\n \u2022 Direct Investments - Net Lease - Healthcare properties operated under net leases with a single tenant operator. \n \u2022 Direct Investments - Operating - Healthcare properties operated pursuant to management agreements with healthcare operators. \n \u2022 Unconsolidated Investments - Healthcare joint ventures, including properties operated under net leases or pursuant to management agreements with healthcare operators, in which we own a minority interest. \n \u2022 Debt and Securities Investments - Mortgage loans or mezzanine loans to owners of healthcare real estate and commercial mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, backed primarily by loans secured by healthcare properties.  For information regarding our investments as of December 31, 2019, refer to Our Investments\u201d included in Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\n2019 Significant Developments\nPerformance Summary\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, performance of our direct operating investments improved over prior year results. On a same store basis (which excludes properties placed in service and/or sold during 2018 or 2019), rental and resident fee income, net of property operating expenses, of our direct operating investments increased to $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhile the weighted average resident occupancy of our operating properties remained consistent with the prior year at 81.6%, our direct operating investments benefited from the following during the year ended December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 higher operating revenues as a result of billing rate increases; \n \u2022 lower expenses, primarily staffing and salary related, in our ILF portfolios; and \n \u2022 non-recurring resident fee income and one-time expense savings recognized in select portfolios also contributed to improved financial performance.  The performance of our unconsolidated investment portfolios also improved for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to prior year results:\n \u2022 the Espresso joint venture completed several operator transitions for its net lease SNF portfolios, which resulted in higher rental income collected; \n \u2022 the Trilogy joint venture continued its expansion and development of operating real estate while same store improvements drove higher operating results; and \n \u2022 the Envoy joint venture sold its remaining investments, which resulted in the recognition of residual earnings upon the completion of the sale.  Distributions from our unconsolidated ventures continue to be limited by reinvestment and development in the Trilogy and Griffin joint ventures and working capital needs for the Espresso joint venture, which have negatively impacted our liquidity position.\nFor additional information on financial results, refer to -Results of Operations.\u201d\nInvestments and Dispositions\n \u2022 In March 2019, the Envoy joint venture, of which we own 11.4%, completed the sale of the remaining 11 properties in the portfolio, for a sales price of $118.0 million, generating net proceeds to us of $4.3 million. \n \u2022 In March 2019, we contributed $2.4 million to the Trilogy joint venture for development initiatives, including senior housing campus development. \n \u2022 In May 2019, we sold two properties within the Peregrine portfolio for $19.7 million, generating net proceeds of $3.3 million, after the repayment of the outstanding mortgage principal balance of $16.4 million and transaction costs. \n \u2022 In June 2019, we contributed $37.4 million to the Griffin-American joint venture to refinance outstanding mortgage debt. \n \u2022 In September 2019, the Eclipse joint venture, of which we own 5.6%, sold nine properties within the portfolio, generating net proceeds to us of $2.1 million. \n \u2022 In November 2019, we received a partial repayment of principal on the Espresso mezzanine loan totaling $0.8 million, in connection with the borrower's sale of a net lease facility. \n \u2022 In December 2019, the Griffin-American joint venture, of which we own 14.3%, sold three properties within its portfolio. Our proportionate share of the net proceeds generated from the sale totaled $16.9 million.  Liquidity, Capital and Dividends\n \u2022 Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity. \n \u2022 In April 2019, we terminated our revolving credit facility, or our Corporate Facility, which we had not previously drawn upon. \n \u2022 In May 2019, we extended the maturity date of our revolving line of credit from an affiliate of Colony Capital, or the Sponsor Line, through December 2021. \n \u2022 In July 2019, we refinanced an existing $12.4 million seller note payable, collateralized by a property within the Rochester portfolio, with a $12.8 million mortgage note payable. The new mortgage note carries an interest rate of 2.90% plus LIBOR, with an initial maturity date of August 2021. \n \u2022 In December 2019, our board of directors approved and established an estimated value per share of our common stock of $6.25 as of June 30, 2019.  Portfolio\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2019, our Winterfell portfolio's average occupancy was 79.8%, consistent with the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 The operating portfolios managed by Watermark Retirement Communities maintained an overall average occupancy of 83.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was overall consistent with the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 During 2019, impairment losses totaling $27.6 million were recorded due to performance issues at properties within the Rochester, Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios, as well as to reflect an updated net realizable value for a property designated as held for sale. \nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe generate revenues from resident fees, rental income and net interest income. Resident fee income from our senior housing operating facilities is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges and other resident charges. Rental income is generated from our real estate for the leasing of space to various types of healthcare operators/tenants/residents. Net interest income is generated from our debt investment. Additionally, we report our proportionate interest of revenues and expenses from unconsolidated joint ventures, which own healthcare real estate, through equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures on our consolidated statements of operations.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\u201d for a description of these metrics) to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business.\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nInvesting in and lending to the healthcare real estate sector requires an in-depth understanding of the specialized nature of healthcare facility operations and the healthcare regulatory environment. While these competitive constraints may create opportunities for attractive investments in the healthcare property sector, they may also provide challenges and risks when seeking attractive terms for our investments.\nWe believe owners and operators of senior housing facilities and other healthcare properties may benefit from demographic and economic trends, specifically the aging of the United States population whereby Americans aged 65 years old and older are expected to increase from 49.2 million in 2016 to 78.0 million in 2035 (source: U.S. Census Bureau 2017 National Population Projections), and the increasing demand for care for seniors outside of their homes. As a result of these demographic trends, we expect healthcare costs to increase at a faster rate than the available funding from both private sources and government-sponsored healthcare programs. Healthcare spending in the U.S. is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.5% over the next 10 years and increase from $3.6 trillion in 2018 to $6.0 trillion in 2027 (source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS). As healthcare costs increase, insurers, individuals and the U.S. government are pursuing lower cost options for healthcare. Senior housing facilities, such as ALFs, MCFs, SNFs and ILFs, are generally more cost effective than higher acuity healthcare settings, such as short or long-term acute-care hospitals, in-patient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. The growth in total demand for healthcare, cost constraints, new regulations, broad U.S. demographic changes and the shift towards cost effective community-based settings is resulting in dynamic changes to the healthcare delivery system.\nNotwithstanding the growth in the industry and demographics, economic and healthcare market uncertainty has had a negative impact, weakening the market's fundamentals and ultimately reducing tenants/operators' ability to make rent payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the respective leases, as well as reduced income for our operating investments. In addition, increased development and competitive pressures has had an impact on some of our assets. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the industry seniors housing occupancy averaged 88.0%, which was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2019 (source: The National Investment Centers for Senior Housing & Care, or NIC). Overall, occupancy has declined or remained flat in 14 of the last 16 quarters (source: NIC). Seniors housing under construction as a share of inventory remains high, however has now declined to 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a peak of 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 (source: NIC). Further, a tight labor market and competition to attract quality staff continues to drive increased wages and personnel costs, resulting in lower margins. To the extent that occupancy and market rental rates decline, property-level cash flow could be negatively affected and decreased cash flow, in turn, is expected to impact the value of underlying properties.\nFurther third-party payor rules and regulatory changes that are being implemented by the federal and even some state governments and commercial payors to improve quality of care and control healthcare spending may continue to affect reimbursement and increase operating costs to our operators and tenants. We continue to monitor reimbursement program requirements and assess the potential impact that changes in the political environment may have on such programs and the ability of our tenants/operators to meet their payment obligations.\nOur SNF operators receive a majority of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to SNFs could have a material impact on a SNF operator's liquidity and financial condition. SNF operators are currently facing various operational, reimbursement, legal and regulatory challenges due to, among other things, increased wages and labor costs, narrowing of referral networks, shorter lengths of stay, staffing shortages, expenses associated with increased government investigations, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose pricing pressures and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, which could result in lower daily reimbursement rates, lower lease coverage, decreased occupancies and declining operating margins.\nDespite the barriers and constraints to investing in the senior housing sector, demographic and other market dynamics continue to attract investors and capital to the sector. The supply and demand fundamentals that are driven by the increasing need for healthcare services by an aging population have created investment opportunities for investors and thus acquisition activity within the sector continues to be strong.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. For critical accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nImpairment\nOur investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstance, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant/operator/resident receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenant/operator/resident to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future operator/tenant credit losses on unbilled rents receivable based upon an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment losses totaling $27.6 million for our direct investments and held for sale investments. The impairment recognized in 2019 includes:\n \u2022 Rochester portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $19.5 million for two ALFs with continuing poor performance and sustained declines in occupancy as a result of difficult market conditions. \n \u2022 Kansas City portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $3.9 million for two facilities which have generated operating losses due to the operator's inability to sustain adequate occupancy to achieve profitable operating margins. \n \u2022 Peregrine portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $4.1 million for two net lease facilities, for which the tenant has sustained operating losses and has failed to remit rental payments during the year. One of the facilities was designated as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2018 and has been impaired to its estimated fair value.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairment losses totaling $31.0 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of December 31, 2019. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A, for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our unconsolidated ventures have recorded impairments and reserves, which have been recognized through our equity in earnings (losses). The impairment and reserves recorded in 2019 include:\n \u2022 Griffin-American Joint Venture. Impairment losses for operating real estate and held for sale assets, of which our proportionate share totaled $1.9 million. \n \u2022 Eclipse Joint Venture. Impairment losses for a net lease SNF, of which our proportionate share totaled $0.2 million. \n \u2022 Espresso Joint Venture. Impairment losses for a net lease SNF, of which our proportionate share totaled $0.5 million.  We will continue to monitor the performance of, and actively manage, all of our investments. However, there can be no assurance that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the governing documents or underwriting and we may, in the future, record impairment, as appropriate and if required.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resident fee income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,976\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property and other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,093\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on debt investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on mortgage loans held in a securitized trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on mortgage obligations issued by a securitization trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,328\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate properties -

Further, rental income recorded in 2018 was reduced by one-time write-downs, as a result of a net lease tenant not remitting rental payments, which also contributed to the variance. Increases to rental income were offset by the sale of two net lease properties sold within the Peregrine portfolio.\nOther Revenue\nAs a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, non-recurring services and fees at our operating facilities were reclassified into rental and resident fee income, which resulted in a decrease to other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was offset by non-recurring service provider incentives recognized by the Winterfell portfolio, as well as interest earned on uninvested cash.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased $1.3 million primarily as a result of the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in the first quarter of 2018.\nExpenses\nReal Estate Properties - Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (placed in service - 2017 and prior)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AL/MC/CCRC properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IL properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties placed in service - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,026\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty operating expenses decreased $7.5 million, primarily due to the sale of an operating facility in the Fountains portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as expense savings realized in the Winterfell portfolio.

The amended advisory agreement reduced the monthly asset management fee and eliminated acquisition fees paid to our Advisor.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, primarily as a result of higher direct corporate expenses, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, partially offset by lower corporate overhead costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (placed in service - 2016 and prior)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AL/MC/CCRC properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IL properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties placed in service - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties placed in service - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $1.7 million, primarily as a result of real estate portfolios acquired during 2017 and capital improvements funded on same store portfolios.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment losses totaling $36.3 million were recorded due to performance issues at properties within the Winterfell, Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios, as well as to reflect net realizable value of properties designated as held for sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, impairment loss of $5.0 million was recorded a facility within the Peregrine net lease portfolio, due to deteriorating operating results of the tenant.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Mortgage Loans Held in Securitization Trust, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, unrealized gain of $1.5 million on senior housing mortgage loans and debt held in a securitization trust represents the change in the fair value of the consolidated assets and liabilities of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization. There was no unrealized gain recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the disposal of the investment.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, realized gain (loss) on investments and other of $20.2 million is primarily a result of gains recognized from the sales of our investments in the Trilogy portfolio and Freddie Mac securitization.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures and Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 250:

Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion. \n (2) Represents our investment in Solstice.  Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures decreased $1.8 million, primarily due to one-time events in our investment in the Espresso joint venture, including a liability extinguishment gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a loan loss reserve recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. The liability extinguishment gain and the loan loss reserve totaled $14.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively.\nEquity in earnings, net of select revenues and expenses, decreased $8.5 million primarily due to the Espresso portfolio, which has experienced three operator transitions, resulting in a decrease in rental income.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $114,000 and related to our operating properties, which operate through a taxable REIT subsidiary structure. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current principal liquidity needs are to fund: (i) principal and interest payments on our borrowings and other commitments; (ii) operating expenses; (iii) capital expenditures, development and redevelopment activities, including capital calls in connection with our unconsolidated joint venture investments; and (iv) repurchases of our shares.\nOur current primary sources of liquidity include the following: (i) cash on hand; (ii) cash flow generated by our investments, both from our operating activities and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures; (iii) secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, including investment-level financing and/or a corporate credit facility; and (iv) proceeds from full or partial realization of investments.\nOur investments generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, resident fees and interest income, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments, capital expenditures and corporate general and administrative expenses. Our business continues to be impacted by limited growth in revenues due to stagnant occupancy and rate pressures as well as rising labor and benefits costs, resulting in compressed operating margins. Our debt service obligations have also increased over the same period, primarily due to increased recurring principal amortization. At the same time, we believe we need to continue to invest capital into our properties in order to maintain market position, as well as functional and operating standards, or to add value to our properties. As a result, our board of directors has suspended distributions and limited share repurchases, as described in further detail below, in order to maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility to support the execution of our strategic objectives and drive long-term value for stockholders.\nWe currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. For additional information regarding our liquidity needs and capital resources, see below. As of March 19, 2020, we had approximately $39.6 million of unrestricted cash.\nCash From Operations\nWe primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties, rental income from our net leased properties and interest from our debt investment, as well as distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nA substantial majority of our properties, or 79.0% of our operating real estate, excluding our unconsolidated ventures and properties designated held for sale, are operating properties whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash flow from operations continues to be negatively impacted by, among other things, suboptimal occupancy levels, rate pressures, increased labor and benefits costs, as well as rising real estate taxes.\nIn addition, we have significant joint ventures and may not be able to control the timing of distributions, if any, from these investments. As of December 31, 2019, our unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures represented 35.2% and 20.8%, respectively, of our total real estate equity investments, based on cost.\nBorrowings\nWe use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy and are required to make recurring principal and interest payments on our borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding. During year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $22.9 million and $64.2 million in recurring principal and interest payments, respectively, on these borrowings. We currently anticipate that both recurring principal and interest payments will remain consistent in 2020.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures also have significant asset level borrowings. In June 2019, our Griffin-American joint venture completed the refinancing of its prior $1.7 billion consolidated healthcare loan maturing in December 2019. The new interest-only loan totals $1.5 billion with a five-year term, inclusive of extension options. The collateral package for the new loan includes 158 U.S. healthcare properties, but excludes certain assets that were collateral for the previous loan. We have contributed our proportionate share of additional equity to the joint venture to complete the refinancing, which totaled approximately $37.4 million, however, the $16.9 million net proceeds received from the sale of three unencumbered properties within the joint venture effectively decreased the equity contribution required to complete the refinancing.\nIn addition, our Sponsor Line provides a revolving line of credit for up to $35.0 million. We have not drawn on our Sponsor Line in 2019 and currently have no borrowings outstanding under our Sponsor Line.\nOur charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any securitized mortgage obligations to third parties, is 75.0% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non- cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage was 60.7% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2019, indirect leverage on assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, held through our unconsolidated joint ventures was 63.2%.\nAlthough no significant consolidated borrowings mature in 2020 or 2021, $466.5 million of mortgage notes payable secured by the Watermark Fountains net lease and operating portfolios matures in June 2022, which may require capital to be funded if favorable refinancing is not obtained.\nFor additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Note 6, Borrowings\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCapital Expenditures, Development and Redevelopment Activities\nWe are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and, from time to time, may also fund capital expenditures for certain net leased properties. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position, as well as functional and operating standards. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $22.3 million on capital expenditures for our direct investments. In addition, we will continue to execute on and identify strategic development opportunities for our existing investments that may involve replacing, converting or renovating facilities in our portfolio which, in turn, would allow us to provide an optimal mix of services, increase operating income, achieve property stabilization and enhance the overall value of our assets.\nWe are also party to certain agreements that contemplate development of healthcare properties funded by us and our joint venture partners. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences under our joint venture governing documents for any such failure to fund.\nDisposition of Investments\nWe also evaluate dispositions of non-core investments to provide an additional source of liquidity. In 2019, we generated total net proceeds, after mortgage and loan repayments, of $26.6 million from dispositions of our direct investments and investments within our unconsolidated ventures. Refer to -2019 Significant Developments\u201d for additional details. We will continue to evaluate and expect additional dispositions of investments in 2020.\nWe have made significant investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties which we may share decision-making authority regarding certain major decisions and could prevent us from selling properties or our interest in the joint venture.\nFurther, our $74.2 million mezzanine loan debt investment matures January 2021. If the borrower is not able to refinance with another lender or otherwise repay the principal amount at its stated maturity, we may have to negotiate modifications to the loan agreement, which may delay our ability to realize liquidity from this investment.\nDistributions\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated, and continue to generate, net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity. Refer to Distributions Declared and Paid\u201d for further information regarding our historical distributions.\nRepurchases\nWe have adopted a Share Repurchase Program effective August 7, 2012, as most recently amended in October 2018, which enables stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. In October 2018, our board of directors approved an amended and restated Share Repurchase Program, under which we will only repurchase shares in connection with the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. However, our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate amount of $10.7 million. Refer to Note 9, Stockholders' Equity\u201d and Note 15, Subsequent Events\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOther Commitments\nWe expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, pursuant to our advisory agreement, as applicable, in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. In December 2017, our advisory agreement was amended with changes to the asset management and acquisition fee structure. We renewed our advisory agreement with our Advisor on June 30, 2019 for an additional one-year term on terms identical to those previously in effect. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for further information regarding our advisory fees.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,287\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(314,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,235\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(220,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(171,404\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the timing of property operating expense payments, which resulted in our operating properties having lower accounts payable and accrued expense balances as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Lower interest income due to the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in March 2018 also contributed to the variance.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund investment improvements and acquisitions, net of any investment dispositions. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily the Griffin-American capital contribution funded in June 2019 and additional capital improvements to existing investments, partially offset by the proceeds from the Peregrine properties sale and distributions received from our investment in unconsolidated ventures. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the sale of an ownership interest in the Trilogy joint venture and the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization, partially offset by additional capital improvements to existing investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding capital expenditures made at our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,382\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total improvement of operating real estate investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock and changes in our mortgage notes payable. Cash flows used in financing activities was $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash used of $31.2 million was primarily attributable to the suspension of dividends in February 2019 and amended share repurchase program in October 2018, partially offset by the Peregrine portfolio mortgage repayment in May 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $17.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in asset management and acquisition fees paid to our Advisor.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund investment improvements and acquisitions, net of any investment dispositions. Net cash provided by investing activities was $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash used of $314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 are primarily attributable to the sale of an ownership interest in the Trilogy joint venture and the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization, partially offset by additional capital improvements to existing investments. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relate to the acquisition of three operating real estate portfolios and additional capital contributions to our unconsolidated ventures.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital improvements during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding capital improvements made at our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total improvement of operating real estate investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock and changes in our mortgage notes payable.

We are not directly liable for the obligations and commitments of our unconsolidated ventures. Borrowings that are maturing in our unconsolidated ventures may require us to fund additional contributions if favorable refinancing is not obtained. We are not obligated to fund capital contributions, however our investment in the unconsolidated investment may be diluted and we may be prohibited from participating in future cash flows if we are unable to fund. \n (3) Estimated interest payments are based on the remaining life of the borrowings.

In addition, our joint venture partners may be entitled to call additional capital under the governing documents of our joint ventures and certain of our tenants/operators/managers may require us to fund capital projects under our leases or management agreements.\nAlthough we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences for any such failure to fund.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nInflation\nSome of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors may influence our performance. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases allow for annual rent increases based on the greater of certain percentages or increase in the relevant consumer price index. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our healthcare properties.\nRefer to", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d References to we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nIntroduction\nWe have invested in independent living facilities, or ILFs, assisted living facilities, or ALFs, memory care facilities, or MCFs, continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, which we collectively refer to as senior housing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, medical office buildings, or MOBs, and hospitals.\nOur primary investment segments are as follows:\n \u2022 Direct Investments - Net Lease - Healthcare properties operated under net leases with a single tenant operator. \n \u2022 Direct Investments - Operating - Healthcare properties operated pursuant to management agreements with healthcare operators. \n \u2022 Unconsolidated Investments - Healthcare joint ventures, including properties operated under net leases or pursuant to management agreements with healthcare operators, in which we own a minority interest. \n \u2022 Debt and Securities Investments - Mortgage loans or mezzanine loans to owners of healthcare real estate and commercial mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, backed primarily by loans secured by healthcare properties.  For information regarding our investments as of December 31, 2019, refer to Our Investments\u201d included in Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\n2019 Significant Developments\nPerformance Summary\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, performance of our direct operating investments improved over prior year results. On a same store basis (which excludes properties placed in service and/or sold during 2018 or 2019), rental and resident fee income, net of property operating expenses, of our direct operating investments increased to $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhile the weighted average resident occupancy of our operating properties remained consistent with the prior year at 81.6%, our direct operating investments benefited from the following during the year ended December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 higher operating revenues as a result of billing rate increases; \n \u2022 lower expenses, primarily staffing and salary related, in our ILF portfolios; and \n \u2022 non-recurring resident fee income and one-time expense savings recognized in select portfolios also contributed to improved financial performance.  The performance of our unconsolidated investment portfolios also improved for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to prior year results:\n \u2022 the Espresso joint venture completed several operator transitions for its net lease SNF portfolios, which resulted in higher rental income collected; \n \u2022 the Trilogy joint venture continued its expansion and development of operating real estate while same store improvements drove higher operating results; and \n \u2022 the Envoy joint venture sold its remaining investments, which resulted in the recognition of residual earnings upon the completion of the sale.  Distributions from our unconsolidated ventures continue to be limited by reinvestment and development in the Trilogy and Griffin joint ventures and working capital needs for the Espresso joint venture, which have negatively impacted our liquidity position.\nFor additional information on financial results, refer to -Results of Operations.\u201d\nInvestments and Dispositions\n \u2022 In March 2019, the Envoy joint venture, of which we own 11.4%, completed the sale of the remaining 11 properties in the portfolio, for a sales price of $118.0 million, generating net proceeds to us of $4.3 million. \n \u2022 In March 2019, we contributed $2.4 million to the Trilogy joint venture for development initiatives, including senior housing campus development. \n \u2022 In May 2019, we sold two properties within the Peregrine portfolio for $19.7 million, generating net proceeds of $3.3 million, after the repayment of the outstanding mortgage principal balance of $16.4 million and transaction costs. \n \u2022 In June 2019, we contributed $37.4 million to the Griffin-American joint venture to refinance outstanding mortgage debt. \n \u2022 In September 2019, the Eclipse joint venture, of which we own 5.6%, sold nine properties within the portfolio, generating net proceeds to us of $2.1 million. \n \u2022 In November 2019, we received a partial repayment of principal on the Espresso mezzanine loan totaling $0.8 million, in connection with the borrower's sale of a net lease facility. \n \u2022 In December 2019, the Griffin-American joint venture, of which we own 14.3%, sold three properties within its portfolio. Our proportionate share of the net proceeds generated from the sale totaled $16.9 million.  Liquidity, Capital and Dividends\n \u2022 Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity. \n \u2022 In April 2019, we terminated our revolving credit facility, or our Corporate Facility, which we had not previously drawn upon. \n \u2022 In May 2019, we extended the maturity date of our revolving line of credit from an affiliate of Colony Capital, or the Sponsor Line, through December 2021. \n \u2022 In July 2019, we refinanced an existing $12.4 million seller note payable, collateralized by a property within the Rochester portfolio, with a $12.8 million mortgage note payable. The new mortgage note carries an interest rate of 2.90% plus LIBOR, with an initial maturity date of August 2021. \n \u2022 In December 2019, our board of directors approved and established an estimated value per share of our common stock of $6.25 as of June 30, 2019.  Portfolio\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2019, our Winterfell portfolio's average occupancy was 79.8%, consistent with the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 The operating portfolios managed by Watermark Retirement Communities maintained an overall average occupancy of 83.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was overall consistent with the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 During 2019, impairment losses totaling $27.6 million were recorded due to performance issues at properties within the Rochester, Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios, as well as to reflect an updated net realizable value for a property designated as held for sale. \nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe generate revenues from resident fees, rental income and net interest income. Resident fee income from our senior housing operating facilities is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges and other resident charges. Rental income is generated from our real estate for the leasing of space to various types of healthcare operators/tenants/residents. Net interest income is generated from our debt investment. Additionally, we report our proportionate interest of revenues and expenses from unconsolidated joint ventures, which own healthcare real estate, through equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures on our consolidated statements of operations.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\u201d for a description of these metrics) to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business.\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nInvesting in and lending to the healthcare real estate sector requires an in-depth understanding of the specialized nature of healthcare facility operations and the healthcare regulatory environment. While these competitive constraints may create opportunities for attractive investments in the healthcare property sector, they may also provide challenges and risks when seeking attractive terms for our investments.\nWe believe owners and operators of senior housing facilities and other healthcare properties may benefit from demographic and economic trends, specifically the aging of the United States population whereby Americans aged 65 years old and older are expected to increase from 49.2 million in 2016 to 78.0 million in 2035 (source: U.S. Census Bureau 2017 National Population Projections), and the increasing demand for care for seniors outside of their homes. As a result of these demographic trends, we expect healthcare costs to increase at a faster rate than the available funding from both private sources and government-sponsored healthcare programs. Healthcare spending in the U.S. is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.5% over the next 10 years and increase from $3.6 trillion in 2018 to $6.0 trillion in 2027 (source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS). As healthcare costs increase, insurers, individuals and the U.S. government are pursuing lower cost options for healthcare. Senior housing facilities, such as ALFs, MCFs, SNFs and ILFs, are generally more cost effective than higher acuity healthcare settings, such as short or long-term acute-care hospitals, in-patient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. The growth in total demand for healthcare, cost constraints, new regulations, broad U.S. demographic changes and the shift towards cost effective community-based settings is resulting in dynamic changes to the healthcare delivery system.\nNotwithstanding the growth in the industry and demographics, economic and healthcare market uncertainty has had a negative impact, weakening the market's fundamentals and ultimately reducing tenants/operators' ability to make rent payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the respective leases, as well as reduced income for our operating investments. In addition, increased development and competitive pressures has had an impact on some of our assets. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the industry seniors housing occupancy averaged 88.0%, which was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2019 (source: The National Investment Centers for Senior Housing & Care, or NIC). Overall, occupancy has declined or remained flat in 14 of the last 16 quarters (source: NIC). Seniors housing under construction as a share of inventory remains high, however has now declined to 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a peak of 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 (source: NIC). Further, a tight labor market and competition to attract quality staff continues to drive increased wages and personnel costs, resulting in lower margins. To the extent that occupancy and market rental rates decline, property-level cash flow could be negatively affected and decreased cash flow, in turn, is expected to impact the value of underlying properties.\nFurther third-party payor rules and regulatory changes that are being implemented by the federal and even some state governments and commercial payors to improve quality of care and control healthcare spending may continue to affect reimbursement and increase operating costs to our operators and tenants. We continue to monitor reimbursement program requirements and assess the potential impact that changes in the political environment may have on such programs and the ability of our tenants/operators to meet their payment obligations.\nOur SNF operators receive a majority of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to SNFs could have a material impact on a SNF operator's liquidity and financial condition. SNF operators are currently facing various operational, reimbursement, legal and regulatory challenges due to, among other things, increased wages and labor costs, narrowing of referral networks, shorter lengths of stay, staffing shortages, expenses associated with increased government investigations, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose pricing pressures and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, which could result in lower daily reimbursement rates, lower lease coverage, decreased occupancies and declining operating margins.\nDespite the barriers and constraints to investing in the senior housing sector, demographic and other market dynamics continue to attract investors and capital to the sector. The supply and demand fundamentals that are driven by the increasing need for healthcare services by an aging population have created investment opportunities for investors and thus acquisition activity within the sector continues to be strong.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. For critical accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nImpairment\nOur investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstance, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant/operator/resident receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenant/operator/resident to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future operator/tenant credit losses on unbilled rents receivable based upon an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment losses totaling $27.6 million for our direct investments and held for sale investments. The impairment recognized in 2019 includes:\n \u2022 Rochester portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $19.5 million for two ALFs with continuing poor performance and sustained declines in occupancy as a result of difficult market conditions. \n \u2022 Kansas City portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $3.9 million for two facilities which have generated operating losses due to the operator's inability to sustain adequate occupancy to achieve profitable operating margins. \n \u2022 Peregrine portfolio. Impairment losses totaling $4.1 million for two net lease facilities, for which the tenant has sustained operating losses and has failed to remit rental payments during the year. One of the facilities was designated as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2018 and has been impaired to its estimated fair value.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairment losses totaling $31.0 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of December 31, 2019. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A, for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our unconsolidated ventures have recorded impairments and reserves, which have been recognized through our equity in earnings (losses). The impairment and reserves recorded in 2019 include:\n \u2022 Griffin-American Joint Venture. Impairment losses for operating real estate and held for sale assets, of which our proportionate share totaled $1.9 million. \n \u2022 Eclipse Joint Venture. Impairment losses for a net lease SNF, of which our proportionate share totaled $0.2 million. \n \u2022 Espresso Joint Venture. Impairment losses for a net lease SNF, of which our proportionate share totaled $0.5 million.  We will continue to monitor the performance of, and actively manage, all of our investments. However, there can be no assurance that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the governing documents or underwriting and we may, in the future, record impairment, as appropriate and if required.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRevenues\nResident Fee Income\nThe following table presents resident fee income generated during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nOn a same store basis, resident fee income increased $4.5 million primarily as a result of non-recurring income recognized in the Fountains portfolio, billing rate increases for the Watermark Aqua and Fountains portfolios and a one-time adjustment which reduced revenue for the Rochester portfolio in 2018. The resident fee income generated by Pinebrook memory care expansion, which opened in November 2018, was offset by decreases in revenue as a result of the sale of an operating facility in the Fountains portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nRental Income\nThe following table presents rental income generated during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRental income increased $1.6 million primarily due to non-recurring services and fees at our IL properties, which were recorded as rental income during the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard and were previously recorded as other revenue. Further, rental income recorded in 2018 was reduced by one-time write-downs, as a result of a net lease tenant not remitting rental payments, which also contributed to the variance. Increases to rental income were offset by the sale of two net lease properties sold within the Peregrine portfolio.\nOther Revenue\nAs a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, non-recurring services and fees at our operating facilities were reclassified into rental and resident fee income, which resulted in a decrease to other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was offset by non-recurring service provider incentives recognized by the Winterfell portfolio, as well as interest earned on uninvested cash.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased $1.3 million primarily as a result of the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in the first quarter of 2018.\nExpenses\nReal Estate Properties - Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nProperty operating expenses decreased $7.5 million, primarily due to the sale of an operating facility in the Fountains portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as expense savings realized in the Winterfell portfolio. One-time bad debt expense for straight-line rent recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of a net lease portfolio tenant not remitting rental payments, also contributed to the variance.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nInterest expense decreased $1.3 million as a result of lower mortgage notes balances during the year ended December 31, 2019 due to continued principal amortization and loan payoffs.\nOther Expenses Related to Securitization Trust\nOther expenses related to securitization trust were not incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization was sold in the first quarter of 2018. Securitization trust expenses were primarily comprised of fees paid to Freddie Mac, the original issuer, as guarantor of the interest and principal payments related to the investment grade securitization bonds.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 are primarily residual costs incurred for the Rochester operator license transfer. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 are primarily costs incurred for the Winterfell and Bonaventure operator transition.\nAsset Management and Other Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management and other fees - related party decreased $3.7 million as a result of the declining estimated net asset value year over year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 million, primarily as a result of lower corporate overhead costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $36.1 million, primarily as a result of intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the Winterfell and Rochester portfolios in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, impairment losses totaled $27.6 million. Impairment was recognized for two ALFs with sustained low occupancy within the Rochester portfolio, as well as poor performing properties within the Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment losses totaling $36.3 million were recorded due to performance issues at properties within the Winterfell, Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios, as well as to reflect net realizable value of properties designated as held for sale.\nOther Income (Loss)\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains of $6.3 million related to the sale of the properties within the Peregrine portfolio and Remainder Interests in the Fountains portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2018, realized gains of $20.2 million was primarily a result of the sales of our investments in the Trilogy portfolio and Freddie Mac securitization.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures and Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n (1) Represents our proportionate share of revenues and expenses excluded from the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion. \n (2) Represents our investment in Solstice.  Our proportionate share of losses generated by our unconsolidated ventures decreased by $30.0 million, primarily due to lower impairment and reserves recognized by the Griffin-American and Espresso joint ventures during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nEquity in earnings, net of select revenues and expenses, increased $1.5 million, primarily due to continued expansion and development of operating real estate and same store improvements in the Trilogy joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, residual earnings were recognized by the Envoy joint venture upon the completion of the sale of its remaining operating assets during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $75,000 and related to our operating properties, which operate through a taxable REIT subsidiary structure. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $114,000.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRevenues\nResident Fee Income\nThe following table presents resident fee income generated during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n (1) Includes resident fee income generated from our Kansas City portfolio, which transitioned from a net leased portfolio to an operating portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017.  Resident fee income increased $2.7 million primarily as a result of occupancy and billing rates improvements for the Watermark Aqua and Fountains portfolios on a same store basis.\nRental Income\nThe following table presents rental income generated during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRental income increased $3.8 million primarily as a result of the Rochester portfolio acquisition, which closed during the third and fourth quarters of 2017. On a same store basis, rental income declined primarily due to a decrease in the average occupancy for the Winterfell portfolio, which decreased to approximately 80% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to approximately 89% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased $2.0 million and primarily represents additional revenue recognized from non-recurring services and fees at our operating facilities as well as interest earned on uninvested cash.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased $5.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in the first quarter of 2018.\nExpenses\nReal Estate Properties - Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n (1) Primarily reserves for uncollectible rents from our net lease properties. \n (2) Includes operating expenses incurred by our Kansas City portfolio, which transitioned from a net leased portfolio to an operating portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017.  Property operating expenses increased $24.9 million, primarily as a result of real estate portfolios acquired during 2017. On a same store basis, property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of rising labor and benefits costs.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\nInterest expense increased $9.1 million, primarily as a result of mortgage and seller financing obtained for 2017 acquisitions. On a same store basis, additional financing obtained for the Watermark Fountains portfolio in December 2017 resulted in an increase to interest expense.\nOther Expenses Related to Securitization Trust\nOther expenses related to securitization trust decreased $3.1 million as a result of the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in the first quarter of 2018. Securitization trust expenses were primarily comprised of fees paid to Freddie Mac, the original issuer, as guarantor of the interest and principal payments related to the investment grade securitization bonds.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 are primarily a result of the residual costs incurred for the Winterfell and Avamere operator transition. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 are primarily the result of the Rochester portfolio acquisition, which closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nAsset Management and Other Fees - Related Party\nAsset management and other fees - related party decreased $18.5 million primarily as a result of the December 2017 amendment to the advisory agreement which became effective during the first quarter of 2018. The amended advisory agreement reduced the monthly asset management fee and eliminated acquisition fees paid to our Advisor.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, primarily as a result of higher direct corporate expenses, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, partially offset by lower corporate overhead costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $1.7 million, primarily as a result of real estate portfolios acquired during 2017 and capital improvements funded on same store portfolios.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment losses totaling $36.3 million were recorded due to performance issues at properties within the Winterfell, Kansas City and Peregrine portfolios, as well as to reflect net realizable value of properties designated as held for sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, impairment loss of $5.0 million was recorded a facility within the Peregrine net lease portfolio, due to deteriorating operating results of the tenant.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Mortgage Loans Held in Securitization Trust, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, unrealized gain of $1.5 million on senior housing mortgage loans and debt held in a securitization trust represents the change in the fair value of the consolidated assets and liabilities of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization. There was no unrealized gain recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the disposal of the investment.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, realized gain (loss) on investments and other of $20.2 million is primarily a result of gains recognized from the sales of our investments in the Trilogy portfolio and Freddie Mac securitization.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures and Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n (1) Represents our proportionate share of revenues and expenses excluded from the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion. \n (2) Represents our investment in Solstice.  Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures decreased $1.8 million, primarily due to one-time events in our investment in the Espresso joint venture, including a liability extinguishment gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a loan loss reserve recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. The liability extinguishment gain and the loan loss reserve totaled $14.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively.\nEquity in earnings, net of select revenues and expenses, decreased $8.5 million primarily due to the Espresso portfolio, which has experienced three operator transitions, resulting in a decrease in rental income.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $114,000 and related to our operating properties, which operate through a taxable REIT subsidiary structure. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current principal liquidity needs are to fund: (i) principal and interest payments on our borrowings and other commitments; (ii) operating expenses; (iii) capital expenditures, development and redevelopment activities, including capital calls in connection with our unconsolidated joint venture investments; and (iv) repurchases of our shares.\nOur current primary sources of liquidity include the following: (i) cash on hand; (ii) cash flow generated by our investments, both from our operating activities and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures; (iii) secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, including investment-level financing and/or a corporate credit facility; and (iv) proceeds from full or partial realization of investments.\nOur investments generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, resident fees and interest income, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments, capital expenditures and corporate general and administrative expenses. Our business continues to be impacted by limited growth in revenues due to stagnant occupancy and rate pressures as well as rising labor and benefits costs, resulting in compressed operating margins. Our debt service obligations have also increased over the same period, primarily due to increased recurring principal amortization. At the same time, we believe we need to continue to invest capital into our properties in order to maintain market position, as well as functional and operating standards, or to add value to our properties. As a result, our board of directors has suspended distributions and limited share repurchases, as described in further detail below, in order to maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility to support the execution of our strategic objectives and drive long-term value for stockholders.\nWe currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. For additional information regarding our liquidity needs and capital resources, see below. As of March 19, 2020, we had approximately $39.6 million of unrestricted cash.\nCash From Operations\nWe primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties, rental income from our net leased properties and interest from our debt investment, as well as distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nA substantial majority of our properties, or 79.0% of our operating real estate, excluding our unconsolidated ventures and properties designated held for sale, are operating properties whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash flow from operations continues to be negatively impacted by, among other things, suboptimal occupancy levels, rate pressures, increased labor and benefits costs, as well as rising real estate taxes.\nIn addition, we have significant joint ventures and may not be able to control the timing of distributions, if any, from these investments. As of December 31, 2019, our unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures represented 35.2% and 20.8%, respectively, of our total real estate equity investments, based on cost.\nBorrowings\nWe use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy and are required to make recurring principal and interest payments on our borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding. During year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $22.9 million and $64.2 million in recurring principal and interest payments, respectively, on these borrowings. We currently anticipate that both recurring principal and interest payments will remain consistent in 2020.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures also have significant asset level borrowings. In June 2019, our Griffin-American joint venture completed the refinancing of its prior $1.7 billion consolidated healthcare loan maturing in December 2019. The new interest-only loan totals $1.5 billion with a five-year term, inclusive of extension options. The collateral package for the new loan includes 158 U.S. healthcare properties, but excludes certain assets that were collateral for the previous loan. We have contributed our proportionate share of additional equity to the joint venture to complete the refinancing, which totaled approximately $37.4 million, however, the $16.9 million net proceeds received from the sale of three unencumbered properties within the joint venture effectively decreased the equity contribution required to complete the refinancing.\nIn addition, our Sponsor Line provides a revolving line of credit for up to $35.0 million. We have not drawn on our Sponsor Line in 2019 and currently have no borrowings outstanding under our Sponsor Line.\nOur charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any securitized mortgage obligations to third parties, is 75.0% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non- cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage was 60.7% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2019, indirect leverage on assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, held through our unconsolidated joint ventures was 63.2%.\nAlthough no significant consolidated borrowings mature in 2020 or 2021, $466.5 million of mortgage notes payable secured by the Watermark Fountains net lease and operating portfolios matures in June 2022, which may require capital to be funded if favorable refinancing is not obtained.\nFor additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Note 6, Borrowings\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCapital Expenditures, Development and Redevelopment Activities\nWe are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and, from time to time, may also fund capital expenditures for certain net leased properties. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position, as well as functional and operating standards. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $22.3 million on capital expenditures for our direct investments. In addition, we will continue to execute on and identify strategic development opportunities for our existing investments that may involve replacing, converting or renovating facilities in our portfolio which, in turn, would allow us to provide an optimal mix of services, increase operating income, achieve property stabilization and enhance the overall value of our assets.\nWe are also party to certain agreements that contemplate development of healthcare properties funded by us and our joint venture partners. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences under our joint venture governing documents for any such failure to fund.\nDisposition of Investments\nWe also evaluate dispositions of non-core investments to provide an additional source of liquidity. In 2019, we generated total net proceeds, after mortgage and loan repayments, of $26.6 million from dispositions of our direct investments and investments within our unconsolidated ventures. Refer to -2019 Significant Developments\u201d for additional details. We will continue to evaluate and expect additional dispositions of investments in 2020.\nWe have made significant investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties which we may share decision-making authority regarding certain major decisions and could prevent us from selling properties or our interest in the joint venture.\nFurther, our $74.2 million mezzanine loan debt investment matures January 2021. If the borrower is not able to refinance with another lender or otherwise repay the principal amount at its stated maturity, we may have to negotiate modifications to the loan agreement, which may delay our ability to realize liquidity from this investment.\nDistributions\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated, and continue to generate, net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity. Refer to Distributions Declared and Paid\u201d for further information regarding our historical distributions.\nRepurchases\nWe have adopted a Share Repurchase Program effective August 7, 2012, as most recently amended in October 2018, which enables stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. In October 2018, our board of directors approved an amended and restated Share Repurchase Program, under which we will only repurchase shares in connection with the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. However, our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate amount of $10.7 million. Refer to Note 9, Stockholders' Equity\u201d and Note 15, Subsequent Events\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOther Commitments\nWe expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, pursuant to our advisory agreement, as applicable, in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. In December 2017, our advisory agreement was amended with changes to the asset management and acquisition fee structure. We renewed our advisory agreement with our Advisor on June 30, 2019 for an additional one-year term on terms identical to those previously in effect. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for further information regarding our advisory fees.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the timing of property operating expense payments, which resulted in our operating properties having lower accounts payable and accrued expense balances as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Lower interest income due to the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization in March 2018 also contributed to the variance.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund investment improvements and acquisitions, net of any investment dispositions. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily the Griffin-American capital contribution funded in June 2019 and additional capital improvements to existing investments, partially offset by the proceeds from the Peregrine properties sale and distributions received from our investment in unconsolidated ventures. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the sale of an ownership interest in the Trilogy joint venture and the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization, partially offset by additional capital improvements to existing investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding capital expenditures made at our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\n\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock and changes in our mortgage notes payable. Cash flows used in financing activities was $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash used of $31.2 million was primarily attributable to the suspension of dividends in February 2019 and amended share repurchase program in October 2018, partially offset by the Peregrine portfolio mortgage repayment in May 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $17.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in asset management and acquisition fees paid to our Advisor.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund investment improvements and acquisitions, net of any investment dispositions. Net cash provided by investing activities was $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash used of $314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 are primarily attributable to the sale of an ownership interest in the Trilogy joint venture and the sale of our investment in the Freddie Mac securitization, partially offset by additional capital improvements to existing investments. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relate to the acquisition of three operating real estate portfolios and additional capital contributions to our unconsolidated ventures.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital improvements during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding capital improvements made at our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\n\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock and changes in our mortgage notes payable. Cash flows used in financing activities was $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change of $220.8 million was primarily attributable to payments of dividends and share repurchases, while no proceeds were obtained from real estate financings during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\n_____________________________________\n (1) Represents contractual amortization of principal and repayment upon contractual maturity. \n (2) Represents our proportionate interest in the underlying obligations and commitments of our unconsolidated ventures. We are not directly liable for the obligations and commitments of our unconsolidated ventures. Borrowings that are maturing in our unconsolidated ventures may require us to fund additional contributions if favorable refinancing is not obtained. We are not obligated to fund capital contributions, however our investment in the unconsolidated investment may be diluted and we may be prohibited from participating in future cash flows if we are unable to fund. \n (3) Estimated interest payments are based on the remaining life of the borrowings. Applicable LIBOR rate plus the respective spread as of December 31, 2019 was used to estimate payments for our floating-rate borrowings. \n (4) Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, originating, acquiring and managing investments on our behalf. For such services, our Advisor receives management fees from us based on our most recent net asset value. In addition, our advisory agreement must be renewed in June 2020 and may be renewed on different terms or may be terminated at any time, subject to notice requirements. As a result, the amount included in the table above is an estimate only and assumes the current net asset value and the continuation of our advisory agreement on its current terms. Included in the table is $10.0 million of advisor asset management fees per year that are payable in shares of our common stock. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our Advisor asset management fee. \n (5) Excludes construction related and other commitments for future development. \n (6) Total includes $290.4 million and $595.5 million for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. \n (7) Total includes $171.1 million and $402.1 million for years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  In addition, our joint venture partners may be entitled to call additional capital under the governing documents of our joint ventures and certain of our tenants/operators/managers may require us to fund capital projects under our leases or management agreements.\nAlthough we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences for any such failure to fund.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nInflation\nSome of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors may influence our performance. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases allow for annual rent increases based on the greater of certain percentages or increase in the relevant consumer price index. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our healthcare properties.\nRefer to", "item_7_tables": "Table 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

the key points from the management's discussion and analysis report:\n\n- Their current principal liquidity needs are to fund principal and interest payments, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and share repurchases. Primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from investments, financing, and proceeds from investment realizations.\n\n- Cash flow from operations is negatively impacted by suboptimal occupancy, rate pressures, increased labor costs, and rising real estate taxes. Distributions from joint ventures are limited due to reinvestment and working capital needs.\n\n- They suspended distributions in 2019 to preserve capital and liquidity. The share repurchase program was amended to only allow repurchases related to stockholder death or disability.  \n\n- Investment impairments totaled $27.6 million in 2019 due to poor performance at certain properties. Additional impairments were recorded through equity method investments.\n\n- Net loss was $77.8 million in 2019 compared to $152 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower impairment losses and higher gains on investment dispositions.\n\n- The company believes their capital resources are sufficient to meet capital needs for the next 12 months. Their leverage ratio was 60.7% as of December 31, 2019.\n\n- Significant debt maturities begin in 2022, which may require capital funding if favorable refinancing is not obtained. The mezzanine loan investment also matures in 2021.\n\n- Capital expenditures, excluding joint ventures, were $22.3 million in 2019 compared to $31.2 million in 2018. Development spending decreased while recurring capital expenditures also declined.\n\nIn summary, the company is focused on preserving liquidity and capital while managing challenging industry conditions, debt obligations, and upcoming maturities. Performance improved in 2019 but remains pressured in certain portfolio segments."}
