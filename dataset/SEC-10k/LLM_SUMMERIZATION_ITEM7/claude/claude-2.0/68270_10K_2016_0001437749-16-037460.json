Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nRuby Tuesday, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( RTI,\u201d the Company,\u201d we\u201d and/or our\u201d), owns and operates Ruby Tuesday\u00ae casual dining restaurants. We also franchise the Ruby Tuesday concept in select domestic and international markets. As of May 31, 2016, we owned and operated 646 Ruby Tuesday restaurants located in 38 states. Our franchisees operated 27 domestic and 51 international Ruby Tuesday restaurants in 12 states, Guam, and 14 foreign countries. The Company-owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions of the United States. We consider these regions to be our core markets.\nOn August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of the Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants with perceived limited upside due to market concentration, challenged trade areas, and other factors by September 2016. The plan is designed to streamline the organization through asset rationalization, improve financial profitability, and ultimately create long-term value for shareholders. The approved closures, which include mall, in line, and freestanding sites, encompass restaurants spread throughout all of the geographic regions in which we operate. Of the restaurants expected to close, approximately two-thirds are operated on leased properties and approximately one-third are owned. As discussed further in the Known Events, Uncertainties, and Trends section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d), our fiscal year 2017 results of operations are expected to include additional charges for impairment, estimated lease settlement costs, and severance benefits, inventory write-off and other costs related to the 95 restaurants.\nAlso, as further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh Mexican Grill\u00ae ( Lime Fresh\u201d) restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, after which we were paid $5.0 million. One of the remaining two restaurants closed and transferred to the buyer on June 14, 2016. The remaining restaurant is expected to close and transfer to the buyer on or before the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. All of the eight restaurants involved in this transaction will be rebranded by the buyer as a different restaurant concept. Also during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million. As a result of this transaction, we had no remaining Lime Fresh concept franchisees as of May 31, 2016.\nOur same-restaurant sales for Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 1.4% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, and our diluted loss per share was $0.83 in fiscal year 2016 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.05 in fiscal year 2015. Throughout this MD&A, we discuss our fiscal year 2016 financial results in detail, provide insight for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, as well as discuss known events, uncertainties, and trends. We believe our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance. We remind you, that, in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years, this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReferences to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor's understanding of the franchise system, which includes our traditional domestic and international franchisees. Franchise system revenue is not included in, and is not, revenue of Ruby Tuesday, Inc. However, we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities, which includes royalties. Franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor.\nOverview and Strategies\nThe bar and grill segment of the casual dining industry in which we primarily operate is intensely competitive with respect to prices, services, convenience, locations, employees, advertising and promotion, and the types and quality of food. We compete with other food service operations, including locally-owned restaurants, and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do. We continue to believe there are opportunities to grow same-restaurant sales, strengthen our competitive position, enhance our profitability, and create value through the execution of the following strategies:\nEnhancing Our Business Model\nOver the past few fiscal years, we have developed strategies to reduce our overall cost structure in the areas of cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In April 2014, we implemented a new labor management system to facilitate more efficient staffing that is contributing to lower labor costs. We have also implemented enhanced business processes and capabilities, such as an inventory/food waste management system that should benefit our business model by reducing food waste and manager time on inventory management leading to a better customer experience and improved profitability.\nEnhance Sales and Margins Through Repositioning of Our Core Brand\nWe are in the process of executing a strategic brand transformation of the Ruby Tuesday concept which is designed to make our brand more energetic, affordable, and broadly appealing. We believe the execution of this strategy provides opportunities for increased same-restaurant customer counts and sales growth, and increased shareholder value. Our brand transformation is supported by enhancements in the following areas: food, service, atmosphere, and communication.\nAs part of our transformation strategy, we have taken what we believe to be meaningful steps to improve our food, customer experience, organizational capabilities, and business model. We continue to transform our menu to be broadly appealing, approachable, and affordable by offering compelling value throughout the menu at a wide-range of price points. Additionally, we are testing an initiative to enhance our Garden Bar which we believe is a differentiator for our brand and utilized by approximately half of our guests. Our intent is to incorporate customer feedback to continue to evolve our food offering as well as to promote menu items that customers find highly satisfying.\nEnhancing our service is also a critical component of our brand transformation strategy. In January 2015, we rolled-out a new service training platform which encourages our restaurant teams to provide a genuine, customized experience to our customers while also reinforcing techniques to build add-on sales for beverages, appetizers and desserts. We believe that there are additional opportunities to improve the guest experience by simplifying the menu, recipes, and operating processes which could result in a better and more consistent service execution and guest experience.\nTo further enhance the atmosphere of our restaurants, we are currently developing a remodel plan and began testing prototypes in fiscal year 2016 to determine sales building potential, cost effectiveness, and return on investment. These changes are designed to create an improved dining atmosphere for our customers.\nThe fourth area of our brand transformation strategy is enhancements to our communication and marketing programs. The program is designed to reshape consumer perceptions of the Ruby Tuesday brand and enhance our Fresh American Grill positioning by showcasing our brand personality in a fresh and energetic way, featuring compelling new food products, highlighting the freshness and variety of our Garden Bar, and effectively communicating value and affordability.\nThe four key areas of menu, service, atmosphere, and communication will continue to be foundational drivers of our brand transformation and key to building a stronger business model. We are hopeful that the culmination of the brand transformation strategy in conjunction with engaged restaurant and support teams will ultimately drive customer counts, sales, and average check.\nStrengthen our Balance Sheet to Facilitate Growth and Value Creation\nOur priority for the use of cash is to drive shareholder value. Our objective is to continue to maintain adequate cash levels to support business needs, while investing in our key brand transformation initiatives. Additionally, we will\nconsider other options such as reducing outstanding debt levels and share repurchases. Our success in the key strategic initiatives outlined above should enable us to improve both our returns on assets and equity and create additional shareholder value.\nResults of Operations\nRuby Tuesday Restaurants\nThe table below presents the number of Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> Company-Owned\n</td> <td> Domestic Franchise\n</td> <td> Franchise\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLime Fresh Restaurants\nThe table below presents the number of other concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> Company-Owned\n</td> <td> Franchise\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal year 2016:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Same-restaurant sales* at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 1.4%, while same-restaurant sales at domestic franchise Ruby Tuesday restaurants increased 3.7%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> One Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened and 13 were closed\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Five franchised Ruby Tuesday restaurants were opened and five were closed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We formulated a plan beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to restructure our property portfolio, which ultimately included the planned closing of approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016, resulting in additional impairment charges of $39.2 million in fiscal year 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants.

million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily a result of restaurant closings since the prior fiscal year coupled with a 1.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The decrease in Ruby Tuesday concept same-restaurant sales is attributable to a 3.9% decrease in customer traffic offset by a 2.5% increase in net check.\nThe Lime Fresh concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 decreased 26.2% to $14.4 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily due to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2015. As previously discussed within this MD&A, during the current fiscal year we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants.\nThe Ruby Tuesday concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 decreased 3.6% to $1,100.7 million compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease is primarily a result of restaurant closings since fiscal year 2014 coupled with a 0.5% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The decrease in Ruby Tuesday concept same-restaurant sales is attributable to a 1.4% decrease in customer traffic offset by a 1.0% increase in net check since fiscal year 2014.\nThe Lime Fresh concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 decreased 5.9% to $19.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease is due in part to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2014.\nFranchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business. Franchise royalties (generally 4.0% of monthly sales for franchised Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants and 5.25% of monthly sales for franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants) are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis. Franchise revenue decreased 3.6% to $6.2 million in fiscal year 2016 and increased 1.6% to $6.4 million in fiscal year 2015. Franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties, which totaled $5.9 million and $6.2 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTotal franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchise restaurant sales (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ruby Tuesday concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,668\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,233\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lime Fresh concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,310\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,493\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total franchise restaurant sales (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,711\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,726\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchise restaurant sales growth-percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Includes sales of all domestic and international franchised Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh restaurants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Profit\nSegment profit/(loss) by reportable segment for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment profit/(loss):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ruby Tuesday concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,543 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lime Fresh concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,642 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,630 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,070 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment profit for the year ended May 31, 2016 for the Ruby Tuesday concept decreased $55.5 million to $60.9 million compared to fiscal year 2015 due primarily to a 1.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants, increases in closures and impairments expense of $49.3 million primarily as a result of the formulation of a plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016 coupled with higher impairments of poor performing open restaurants throughout the year as compared to the prior fiscal year, and increases in advertising spending of $1.9 million due primarily to higher internet, magazine, direct mail, and other promotional advertising costs offset by decreases in television advertising. These were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs as further discussed later within this MD&A, and decreases in general and administrative expenses of $4.7 million as a result of lower share-based compensation expense as further discussed later within this MD&A and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a lower accrual for executive bonus, and decreased management labor from reductions in staffing.\nSegment losses for the year ended May 31, 2016 for the Lime Fresh concept increased $2.0 million compared to fiscal year 2015 to $4.6 million due primarily to increases in closures and impairments expense of $3.3 million as the current fiscal year Lime Fresh segment losses include impairment and other charges for eleven Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants which closed during fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSegment profit for the year ended June 2, 2015 for the Ruby Tuesday concept increased $46.9 million to $116.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014 due primarily to reductions in cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs due to initiatives discussed later within this MD&A, and decreases in closures and impairments expense of $20.7 million and advertising expense of $17.5 million. The reduction in closures and impairments expense compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease of impairments in connection with open restaurants with deteriorating operational performance ($8.7 million), early restaurant closures ($5.4 million), and upcoming lease terminations ($1.4 million). The higher closures and impairments in fiscal year 2014 were primarily a result of prior fiscal year same-restaurant sales declines of 5.3% and the closure of 38 Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The reduction in advertising spending relates to reduced cable and television advertising.\nSegment losses for the year ended June 2, 2015 for the Lime Fresh concept decreased $3.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014 to $2.6 million due primarily to decreases in closures and impairments expense of $2.1 million as fiscal year 2014 Lime Fresh segment losses included lease reserve charges related to four undeveloped sites for which management decided to forego restaurant development and a lease reserve charge on a Lime Fresh restaurant contracted to be sold. This was coupled with reductions in cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs due to initiatives discussed later within this MD&A.\nThe following is a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,358 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,391 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,347 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,815 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,710 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,946 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preopening expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(290 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(395 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trademark impairments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,999 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(855 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,764 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,735 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,945 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(757 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,560 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(52,862 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,105 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,575 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Profit\nThe following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, for the periods indicated.

The increase in pre-tax loss is due primarily to higher closures and impairments expense ($52.1 million), a decrease in same-restaurant sales of 1.4% at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants, a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark ($2.0 million), and an increase, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, of costs of goods sold and payroll and related costs. These were partially offset by gain on sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill assets ($5.9 million), a decrease in interest expense, net ($1.0 million) and decreases, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, of other restaurant operating costs and selling, general and administrative, net.\nPre-tax loss from continuing operations decreased $64.5 million from fiscal year 2014 to $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015. The lower pre-tax loss is due to reductions in closures and impairments expense ($22.3 million) and interest expense ($2.2 million) and decreases, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, of cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, depreciation, and selling, general, and administrative, net. In addition, fiscal year 2014 included losses on the extinguishment of debt ($1.4 million) and a charge for the partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark ($0.9 million).\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre-tax loss from continuing operations for years ended May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015 as compared to the comparable prior year. Because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, and depreciation categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate, we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, as well as the absolute dollar change, to the comparable prior year.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased $6.8 million (2.2%) from the prior fiscal year to $298.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 27.3% to 27.5%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2016 was primarily the result of restaurant closures, a decline in same-restaurant sales, and $1.4 million in settlement proceeds from a class-action lawsuit against a former vendor, which were offset by price increases on certain commodity items since the prior fiscal year coupled with a shift in menu mix associated with menu changes introduced in November 2015.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the increase in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily the result of price increases on certain commodity items and a shift in menu mix since the prior fiscal year as discussed above.\nCost of goods sold decreased $16.2 million (5.0%) from fiscal year 2014 to $305.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, cost of goods sold decreased from 27.7% to 27.3%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 was the result of restaurant closures and cost savings on certain products due to renegotiated contracts with certain vendors since fiscal year 2014. These were partially offset by price increases on beef, seafood, poultry, and certain other products since fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the decrease in cost of goods sold for the year ended June 2, 2015 is primarily the result of renegotiated contracts with certain vendors since fiscal year 2014.\nPayroll and Related Costs\nPayroll and related costs decreased $8.7 million (2.3%) from the prior fiscal year to $374.6 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, payroll and related costs increased from 34.2% to 34.5%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended May 31, 2016 was primarily due to restaurant closures, reductions in overtime as a result of scheduling improvements, decreased management labor costs, and lower workers' compensation costs due to favorable claims experience since the prior fiscal year. These reductions were partially offset by higher health insurance due to unfavorable claims experience.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily the result wage inflation and loss of leveraging associated with lower sales volumes.\nPayroll and related costs decreased $21.1 million (5.2%) from fiscal year 2014 to $383.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, payroll and related costs decreased from 34.8% to 34.2%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 2, 2015 was primarily due to restaurant closures, decreases in hourly labor as a result of scheduling improvements with the rollout of a new labor forecasting system in our restaurants, and lower management labor, which were partially offset by higher health insurance costs as a result of unfavorable claims experience and higher bonus expense as more restaurants achieved the performance goals as compared to fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 2, 2015 was primarily the result of decreased hourly and management labor due to reasons discussed above.\nOther Restaurant Operating Costs\nOther restaurant operating costs decreased $12.6 million (5.2%) from the prior fiscal year to $229.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, other restaurant operating costs decreased from 21.6% to 21.2%.\nFor the year ended May 31, 2016, the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following (in thousands):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> Repairs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,607 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent and leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,693 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other decreases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and equipment losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(852 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended May 31, 2016, the decrease was a result of lower building repairs, utilities, and rent and leasing due in part to restaurant closures since the prior fiscal year, lower legal costs related to pending litigation, and insurance as a result of favorable general liability claims. These were partially offset by higher property and equipment losses due primarily to a Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurant that was destroyed by fire during the current fiscal year. In addition, the decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue was partially offset by loss of leveraging associated with lower sales volumes.\nOther restaurant operating costs decreased $15.8 million (6.1%) from the prior year to $242.1 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, other restaurant operating costs decreased from 22.2% to 21.6%.\nFor the year ended June 2, 2015, the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following (in thousands):\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> Repairs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent and leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,698 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gift card breakage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business interruption recoveries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other decreases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,010 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended June 2, 2015, the decrease in other operating costs was primarily a result of reduced building repairs, utilities, and rent and leasing due primarily to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2014, lower legal costs related to pending litigation, higher gift card breakage income, and business interruption recoveries related to claims collected for certain of our restaurants in\nthe Gulf Coast area. These changes were partially offset by higher insurance due in part to unfavorable general liability claims experience in fiscal year 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.0 million (2.0%) to $51.4 million for the year ended May 31, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, depreciation expense was consistent with the prior fiscal year at 4.7%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended May 31, 2016 is due primarily to assets that became fully depreciated or were impaired since the prior fiscal year coupled with restaurant closures.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $5.0 million (8.6%) to $52.4 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, compared to fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, depreciation expense decreased from 4.9% to 4.7%.\nIn terms of absolute dollars, the decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 is due primarily to assets that became fully depreciated since fiscal year 2014 coupled with restaurant closures.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, Net\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses, net decreased $5.7 million (4.9%) from the prior fiscal year to $109.6 million for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nThe decrease for the year ended May 31, 2016 is due to lower general and administrative costs ($7.7 million) offset by higher advertising costs ($2.0 million). The reduction in general and administrative costs is primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense as a result of a forfeiture credit as further discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the substantial completion during fiscal year 2015 of expense recognition related to our Chief Executive Officer's December 2012 inducement awards, a lower accrual for executive bonus, and decreased management labor from reductions in staffing. These were partially offset by higher employee pension-related costs, fees associated with certain service contracts, travel costs associated with restaurant manager training at our Restaurant Support Services Center, and consulting fees. The increase in advertising is primarily a result of higher internet, magazine, direct mail, and other promotional advertising costs offset by decreases in television advertising.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses, net decreased $21.8 million (15.9%) from fiscal year 2014 to $115.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015.\nThe decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 is due to lower advertising costs ($17.7 million) primarily as a result of decreased television advertising, and a reduction in general and administrative costs ($4.1 million) due to lower management labor from reductions in staffing, a decrease in consulting fees, and lower legal fees. The decrease in overall television advertising is attributable to management's desire to spend marketing dollars more efficiently, with an increased focus on supporting our national cable television advertising with print and electronic promotions. These were partially offset by higher accruals for support center bonus.\nClosures and Impairments, Net\nClosures and impairments, net increased $52.1 million to $62.7 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The $52.1 million increase is primarily due to higher property impairment charges ($48.3 million), closed restaurant lease reserve expense ($2.6 million), and other closing costs ($0.3 million), coupled with lower gains on the sale of surplus properties ($0.9 million).\nThe increase in closures and impairments for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily due to higher Ruby Tuesday concept property impairment charges coupled with $6.4 million of impairments, lease reserves, severance, and other charges associated with the closure of 11 Lime Fresh restaurants during the current fiscal year. As further discussed in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of the Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016. Given the status of the plan as of May 31, 2016, we concluded that there was an impairment trigger as certain restaurants would be disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $39.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 related to\nthese restaurants. Also included within Closures and impairments, net for fiscal year 2016 are impairments of $14.7 million related to open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants with deteriorating operational performance during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016 or not included within management's developing closure plan during the fourth fiscal quarter, $3.4 million related to Lime Fresh Mexican Grill concept restaurants, and $0.8 million related to surplus properties.\nClosures and impairments, net decreased $22.3 million to $10.5 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower property impairment charges ($14.5 million), closed restaurant lease reserve expense ($5.8 million), and other closing costs ($1.2 million) coupled with higher gains on the sale of surplus properties ($0.7 million).\nThe decrease in closures and impairments for the year ended June 2, 2015 is primarily due to lower property impairment charges as the same periods of the prior fiscal year included, among other charges, larger impairments attributable to open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants experiencing deteriorating operational performance and related to early restaurant closures. Fiscal year 2014 charges were also higher due to a plan to close approximately 30 Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants by the end of that fiscal year.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014. Further information regarding closures and impairments expense for the Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh concepts for all periods presented is contained in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTrademark Impairments\nAs previously discussed within this MD&A, during fiscal year 2016 we entered into an agreement to sell eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. In connection with these events, we concluded that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million representing a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we concluded that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired by using entity specific projections for undiscounted cash flows that incorporated only those Lime Fresh assets existing as of the measurement date. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $0.9 million representing a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark.\nAs further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As a result of this transaction, our Lime Fresh trademark had no net book value remaining at May 31, 2016. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our trademark impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2016 and 2014.\nGain on Sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill Assets\nAs previously discussed within this MD&A and further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, after which we were paid $5.0 million. One of the remaining two restaurants closed and transferred to the buyer shortly after our fiscal year-end, and the other restaurant is expected to close and transfer to the buyer on or before the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The remaining $1.0 million of consideration will be received when the remaining restaurant has transferred to the buyer. We recognized during fiscal year 2016 a gain of $3.1 million on this transaction. All of the eight restaurants involved in this transaction will be rebranded by the buyer as a different restaurant concept.\nAlso during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million. We recognized a gain of $2.8 million on this transaction.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.0 million to $21.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest resulting from the early payoff of certain mortgage loans and repurchases of our Senior Notes since the prior fiscal year. Partially offsetting these decreases were $0.6 million in increased prepayment premiums paid in connection with mortgage obligations that we prepaid and retired in fiscal year 2016 above those paid in the previous fiscal year.\nInterest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $22.7 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, primarily due to lower interest expense on our Senior Notes due to repurchases during fiscal year 2014 and the early payoff of certain mortgage loans since fiscal year 2014.\n(Gain)/Loss on Extinguishment of Debt\nUnder the terms of the Senior Credit Facility we are allowed, under certain circumstances, to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Senior Notes in any fiscal year. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $1.4 million for the year ended June 3, 2014 due to our repurchase of $20.0 million of the Senior Notes for $20.0 million plus $0.2 million of accrued interest. We realized losses of $0.7 million on these transactions. Additionally, we incurred a $0.7 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 relating to the write-off of the pro rata portion of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the previous credit facility.\nBenefit for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations\nWe recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $2.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, compared to a tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015. Included in our $1.9 million tax benefit for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 was a benefit of $3.2 million recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, representing an immaterial prior period correction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015, compared to a tax benefit from continuing operations of $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 3, 2014. Included in our $1.9 million tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended June 2, 2015 was the previously mentioned benefit of $3.2 million, with the remaining $1.3 million in net expense is attributable to decreased pre-tax losses and changes in uncertain tax reserves for fiscal year 2015.\nWe regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the deferred tax assets in the future. A valuation allowance assessment is performed each reporting period, with any additions or adjustments reflected in earnings in the period of assessment. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction.\nOur valuation allowance for deferred tax assets totaled $89.9 million and $62.8 million as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively. Included within our income tax benefit from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of $28.2 million, $9.1 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, representing the amount reserved for the increase in net deferred tax assets during the periods (primarily related to general business credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards). Additionally, a valuation allowance benefit of $0.3 million was included within the income tax benefit from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014.\nUnder ASC 740, we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. As a result of, among other charges, closures and impairments and trademark impairment charges, we currently reflect a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss. A cumulative pre-tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income, and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome. Before consideration of the valuation\nallowance expense, we had an income tax benefit of $30.4 million, $11.0 million, and $35.9 million, including the tax credits, in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn an effort to focus primarily on the sales turnaround of our core Ruby Tuesday concept and secondly, to improve the financial performance of our then Lime Fresh concept, we completed the closure of our Marlin & Ray's, Wok Hay, and Truffles restaurants during fiscal year 2013. We have classified the results of operations of our Company-owned Marlin & Ray's, Wok Hay, and Truffles concepts as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended June 3, 2014. The results of operations of our discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> June 3, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant sales and operating revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>564 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in thousands).\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,755 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,497 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,203 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,352 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,409 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,753 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease)/ increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,990 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,581 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees. Substantially all of the $1,085.0 million, $1,120.1 million, and $1,162.4 million of restaurant sales and operating revenue disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, was received in cash either at the point of sale or within two to four days (when our customers paid with debit or credit cards). Our primary uses of cash for operating activities are food and beverage purchases, payroll and benefit costs, restaurant operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and marketing, a significant portion of which are incurred and paid in the same period.\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 decreased $14.8 million (27.0%) from the prior fiscal year to $40.1 million. The decrease is primarily the result of lower Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), increases in amounts spent to acquire inventory, decreases in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities due to the timing of payments, and an increase in cash paid for taxes ($2.8 million). These were partially offset by lower cash paid for interest ($1.0 million) due to the prepayment of certain of our mortgage obligations and other principal payments on our debt since the prior fiscal year and a decrease in amounts spent on media advertising (approximately $1.7 million).\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 increased $9.5 million (21.0%) from fiscal year 2014 to $54.9 million. The increase is primarily the result of higher EBITDA due in part to restaurant-level cost improvements and reductions in amounts spent on media advertising. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities due to the timing of payments (approximately $11.4 million) and inventory (approximately $8.9 million) as amounts for fiscal year 2014 related to levels of lobster held in inventory that were significantly lower than those of the preceding year.\nOur working capital and current ratio as of May 31, 2016 were $23.2 million and 1.2:1, respectively. While we typically carry current liabilities in excess of current assets as is common in the restaurant industry, we have reduced our accounts payable and other accrued liabilities since the prior fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nWe require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants, limited new restaurant construction, investments in technology, equipment, remodeling of existing restaurants, and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts. Property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, and/or proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $34.4 million, $31.0 million, and $28.3 million, respectively. In addition, proceeds from the disposal of assets produced $11.7 million, $11.3 million, and $15.5 million of cash in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, following actions taken to more aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt and, for fiscal year 2016, to substantially exit the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 3, 2014, we completed sale-leaseback transactions of the land and building for three Company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants for gross cash proceeds of $5.9 million, exclusive of transaction costs of approximately $0.3 million. Equipment was not included. The net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions were used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, debt payments, and, in fiscal years prior to 2014, the repurchase of shares of our common stock. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are estimated to be in the range of between $38.0 million to $42.0 million. We intend to fund our investing activities with cash currently on hand, cash provided by operations, proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, or borrowings on the Senior Credit Facility.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities, coupled with sale-leaseback transactions and sales of surplus properties. When these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs, we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock.\nOur current borrowings and credit facilities include $212.5 million outstanding principal of 7.625% senior notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes\u201d), a four year revolving credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility\u201d) under which we may borrow up to $50.0 million, and $15.7 million of mortgage loan obligations acquired upon franchise acquisitions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for key terms and further information on our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and mortgage loan obligations.\nUnder the terms of the Senior Credit Facility we are allowed, under certain circumstances, to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Senior Notes in any fiscal year. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions. We did not repurchase any Senior Notes during the year ended June 2, 2015. During the year ended June 3, 2014, we repurchased $20.0 million of the Senior Notes for $20.0 million plus $0.2 million of accrued interest. We realized losses of $0.7 million on these transactions.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we prepaid and retired 16 mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $13.3 million using cash on hand. We paid $1.6 million in prepayment premiums and $0.1 million of accrued interest in connection with the retirement of these obligations. The prepayment of this debt eliminated one mortgage lender and allowed for the release of 44 properties which had served as collateral. Additionally, during fiscal year 2015, we prepaid and retired ten mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $9.0 million using cash on hand. In connection with the retirement of these obligations, we paid $1.0 million in prepayment premiums and an insignificant amount of accrued interest.\nDuring fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we repurchased 1.9 million, an insignificant number, and 0.1 million shares of RTI common stock, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2016, the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased was 9.9 million. Additionally, there were no dividends paid during fiscal years 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nSignificant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nLong-term financial obligations were as follows as of May 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> long-term debt, including\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> current maturities (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>613,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension obligations (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (f)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,007,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>313,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>438,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed-rate debt instruments.

Subsequent to that date Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc. ( Piccadilly\u201d) acquired MFC and Compass Group ( Compass\u201d) acquired MHC. As agreed upon at the time of the distribution, we have been contingently liable for payments to MFC and MHC employees retiring under MFC's and MHC's versions of the Management Retirement Plan and the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan (the two non-qualified defined benefit plans) for the accrued benefits earned by those participants as of March 1996.\nWe estimated our divestiture guarantees at May 31, 2016 to be $6.8 million for employee benefit plans (all of which resides with MHC following Piccadilly's bankruptcy in fiscal 2004). We believe the likelihood of being required to make payments for MHC's portion to be remote due to the size and financial strength of MHC and Compass.\nAs of May 31, 2016, we are the guarantor of nine third-party leases associated with closed concept restaurants. Lease guarantee amounts in the table above represent lease payments for which we are contingently liable. While we believe that the likelihood of being required to make these lease payments is remote, we recorded a guarantee liability of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our operating leases.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding accounting pronouncements not yet adopted is incorporated by reference from Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur MD&A is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we consider the forecasted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the restaurant, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Fair value is market participant-based upon broker estimates of the value of land, building, leasehold improvements, and other residual assets, or estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value.\nUnder our policies, recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment. If a restaurant that has been open for at least six full quarters shows negative cash flow results, we evaluate the plan to reverse the negative performance. Both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments. We also perform tests for impairment of intangible assets when other events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired.\nAs discussed in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in response to a comprehensive review by management of our property portfolio, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested a significant number of open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants for impairment as we concluded it was more likely than not they would close significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life. We evaluated recoverability based on the restaurants forecasted undiscounted cash flows for 107 restaurants, which incorporated probability weighted scenarios of either remaining open or closing in the near term. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the probability weighted scenarios changing by 10% and the results were not materially different. For restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we wrote those assets down to estimated fair value. As a result of this analysis, the Company incurred $39.2 million of impairment charges during fiscal year 2016. We also tested the Lime Fresh trademark for impairment during fiscal years 2016 and 2014 as factors were present which indicated the trademark may be impaired. We determined that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired and recorded charges of $2.0 million and $0.9 million during fiscal years 2016 and 2014, respectively.\nAt May 31, 2016, we had 75 restaurants that had been open for more than six full quarters with rolling 12-month negative cash flows of which 67 are expected to close by September 2016 either as part of the asset rationalization plan as previously discussed or as leases expire. Of the eight restaurants which remained, we recorded impairments for five properties based on their estimated values and we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at the remaining\nthree properties and determined that no impairments were necessary. The remaining net book value of the eight restaurants was $2.2 million at May 31, 2016.\nShould cash flows at these cash flow negative restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time, further impairment charges may occur. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, including cash flows from continuing use, terminal value, closure costs, salvage value, and sublease income. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from our estimates.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Accruals\nWe record deferred tax assets for various items and a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets when current available information raises doubt as to their ultimate realization. Despite the existence of long carryforward periods for some of our largest deferred tax assets, such as unused employment tax credits and federal and/or state net operating losses, and a history of realizing our deferred tax assets by utilizing those credits and losses in subsequent or carryback years, a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss is an example of negative evidence that raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets. To determine the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, we schedule a year-by-year estimation of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in order to determine the availability of future taxable income which would allow for the realization of our existing deferred tax assets. While we are able to incorporate tax planning strategies into our analysis, we do not factor projected future income until such time that the positive evidence supporting realization outweighs the negative evidence (most significantly, the three-year cumulative pre-tax loss).\nWe recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $89.9 million and $62.8 million as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively. Included within our income tax benefit from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of $28.2 million, $9.1 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Additionally, a valuation allowance benefit of $0.3 million was included in income tax benefit from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014. Given that we last recorded pre-tax income in fiscal 2011, we will likely not be able to reverse the significant valuation allowance recorded in the near future. Our recorded valuation allowance may be subject to material changes in the future, as our ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Upon such time that we are able to reverse the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, income tax expense will be reduced, and net income will correspondingly be increased, by the amount we are able to reverse.\nLease Obligations\nWe lease a significant number of our restaurant properties. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease. The term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. The primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with our investment into leasehold improvements which might become impaired should we choose not to continue the use of the leased property.\nOur operating lease term used for straight-line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the end of the lease term. There is potential for variability in our rent holiday\u201d period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments. Factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction-related delays. Extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period.\nFor operating leases that contain predetermined fixed rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as determined above, on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday\u201d period beginning upon possession of the premises), and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments, called \"contingent rents,\" when the associated restaurants' sales volumes exceed agreed-upon levels. We recognize contingent rental expense (in annual as well as interim periods) prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense, provided that achievement of that target is considered probable.\nThe judgment regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease impacts the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday and/or escalation in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant amortized. The material factor we consider when making this judgment is the total amount invested in the restaurant at the inception of the lease and whether management believes that renewal appears reasonably assured. While a different term may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization, and rent expense than reported, our historical lease renewal rates support the judgments made. We have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for leases in any of the fiscal years presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe record the estimated future lease obligations on leased restaurants upon closure for which we have not sublet or settled the lease with the respective landlord as of a quarter end date. Inherent in these estimates is an assumption on the time period we anticipate it will take to reach a settlement with our landlord or to execute on a sublease agreement. We calculate the lease obligation as the present value of future minimum net lease or settlement payments using a discount rate that takes into account the remaining time period prior to the estimated date of resolution. As further discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our estimated lease obligations for closed restaurants as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015 were $6.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively.\nEstimated Liability for Self-Insurance\nWe self-insure a portion of our expected losses under our employee health care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability, and property insurance programs. Specifically with our workers' compensation and general liability coverages, we have stop loss insurance for individual claims in excess of stated loss amounts. Insurance liabilities are recorded based on third-party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses, net of payments made. The estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the Company and supplemental information as appropriate.\nThe analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including, but not limited to, (a) the quality of historical loss and exposure information, (b) the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience, (c) the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the Company, and (d) projected payrolls and revenue. As claims develop, the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates. Therefore, an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required.\nKnown Events, Uncertainties, and Trends\nUpcoming Restaurant Closures\nAs discussed previously within this MD&A and discussed further in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of our Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016. The approved closures, which include mall, in line, and freestanding sites, encompass restaurants spread throughout all of the geographies in which the Company operates. Of the restaurants expected to close, approximately two-thirds are operated on leased properties and approximately one-third are owned.\nWe incurred $39.2 million of impairment charges in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2016 following an impairment analysis performed for the restaurants deemed, as of May 31, 2016, to be more than likely to be closed significantly prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives based on the then status of management's developing plan. In addition to the impairment charges recorded during fiscal year 2016, further impairment charges will be incurred based on changes ultimately made to the plan after May 31, 2016 and as the restaurants actually close. Accordingly, the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017 closures and impairments are expected to include additional impairment charges of approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million for restaurants added to management's plan subsequent to May 31, 2016, approximately $19.0 million to $21.0 million associated with estimated lease settlement costs and approximately $11.0 million to $16.0 million in severance benefits, inventory write-off and other costs. The actual amount of any cash payments made by the Company for lease contract termination costs will be dependent upon ongoing negotiations with the landlords of the leased restaurant properties and could be higher or lower than the amounts currently estimated.\nFinancial Strategy and Stock Repurchase Plan\nCash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2016 were $67.3 million. Our overall goal is to invest in our brand and to strengthen our balance sheet to improve credit metrics. As such, our first priority is to ensure that we have adequate cash levels to run the business and internally fund our capital expenditures. Our second priority is to reduce our outstanding debt to help improve our credit metrics with the goal of improved flexibility and access to capital at reasonable rates. Lastly, we would consider share repurchases within the limitations of our debt covenants to return capital to shareholders. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million. As of May 31, 2016, the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased was 9.9 million. Any of these actions, in any particular period and the actual amount thereof, remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that any such actions will be taken in the future.\nRepurchases of Senior Notes\nWe are allowed under the terms of the Senior Credit Facility to repurchase, in any fiscal year, up to $20.0 million of indebtedness to various holders of the Senior Notes. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions. As of the date of this filing, we may repurchase $20.0 million of the Senior Notes during the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Future repurchases of the Senior Notes, if any, will be funded with available cash on hand.\nDividends\nDuring fiscal 1997, our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders. No dividends were declared or paid during the three year period ended May 31, 2016. The payment of a dividend in any particular period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year 2017 will contain 53 weeks and end on June 6, 2017.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation on the cost of food, labor, supplies, utilities, real estate, and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results. Historically, we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements. Competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases. Historically, the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nRuby Tuesday, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( RTI,\u201d the Company,\u201d we\u201d and/or our\u201d), owns and operates Ruby Tuesday\u00ae casual dining restaurants. We also franchise the Ruby Tuesday concept in select domestic and international markets. As of May 31, 2016, we owned and operated 646 Ruby Tuesday restaurants located in 38 states. Our franchisees operated 27 domestic and 51 international Ruby Tuesday restaurants in 12 states, Guam, and 14 foreign countries. The Company-owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions of the United States. We consider these regions to be our core markets.\nOn August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of the Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants with perceived limited upside due to market concentration, challenged trade areas, and other factors by September 2016. The plan is designed to streamline the organization through asset rationalization, improve financial profitability, and ultimately create long-term value for shareholders. The approved closures, which include mall, in line, and freestanding sites, encompass restaurants spread throughout all of the geographic regions in which we operate. Of the restaurants expected to close, approximately two-thirds are operated on leased properties and approximately one-third are owned. As discussed further in the Known Events, Uncertainties, and Trends section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d), our fiscal year 2017 results of operations are expected to include additional charges for impairment, estimated lease settlement costs, and severance benefits, inventory write-off and other costs related to the 95 restaurants.\nAlso, as further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh Mexican Grill\u00ae ( Lime Fresh\u201d) restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, after which we were paid $5.0 million. One of the remaining two restaurants closed and transferred to the buyer on June 14, 2016. The remaining restaurant is expected to close and transfer to the buyer on or before the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. All of the eight restaurants involved in this transaction will be rebranded by the buyer as a different restaurant concept. Also during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million. As a result of this transaction, we had no remaining Lime Fresh concept franchisees as of May 31, 2016.\nOur same-restaurant sales for Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 1.4% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, and our diluted loss per share was $0.83 in fiscal year 2016 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.05 in fiscal year 2015. Throughout this MD&A, we discuss our fiscal year 2016 financial results in detail, provide insight for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, as well as discuss known events, uncertainties, and trends. We believe our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance. We remind you, that, in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years, this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReferences to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor's understanding of the franchise system, which includes our traditional domestic and international franchisees. Franchise system revenue is not included in, and is not, revenue of Ruby Tuesday, Inc. However, we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities, which includes royalties. Franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor.\nOverview and Strategies\nThe bar and grill segment of the casual dining industry in which we primarily operate is intensely competitive with respect to prices, services, convenience, locations, employees, advertising and promotion, and the types and quality of food. We compete with other food service operations, including locally-owned restaurants, and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do. We continue to believe there are opportunities to grow same-restaurant sales, strengthen our competitive position, enhance our profitability, and create value through the execution of the following strategies:\nEnhancing Our Business Model\nOver the past few fiscal years, we have developed strategies to reduce our overall cost structure in the areas of cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In April 2014, we implemented a new labor management system to facilitate more efficient staffing that is contributing to lower labor costs. We have also implemented enhanced business processes and capabilities, such as an inventory/food waste management system that should benefit our business model by reducing food waste and manager time on inventory management leading to a better customer experience and improved profitability.\nEnhance Sales and Margins Through Repositioning of Our Core Brand\nWe are in the process of executing a strategic brand transformation of the Ruby Tuesday concept which is designed to make our brand more energetic, affordable, and broadly appealing. We believe the execution of this strategy provides opportunities for increased same-restaurant customer counts and sales growth, and increased shareholder value. Our brand transformation is supported by enhancements in the following areas: food, service, atmosphere, and communication.\nAs part of our transformation strategy, we have taken what we believe to be meaningful steps to improve our food, customer experience, organizational capabilities, and business model. We continue to transform our menu to be broadly appealing, approachable, and affordable by offering compelling value throughout the menu at a wide-range of price points. Additionally, we are testing an initiative to enhance our Garden Bar which we believe is a differentiator for our brand and utilized by approximately half of our guests. Our intent is to incorporate customer feedback to continue to evolve our food offering as well as to promote menu items that customers find highly satisfying.\nEnhancing our service is also a critical component of our brand transformation strategy. In January 2015, we rolled-out a new service training platform which encourages our restaurant teams to provide a genuine, customized experience to our customers while also reinforcing techniques to build add-on sales for beverages, appetizers and desserts. We believe that there are additional opportunities to improve the guest experience by simplifying the menu, recipes, and operating processes which could result in a better and more consistent service execution and guest experience.\nTo further enhance the atmosphere of our restaurants, we are currently developing a remodel plan and began testing prototypes in fiscal year 2016 to determine sales building potential, cost effectiveness, and return on investment. These changes are designed to create an improved dining atmosphere for our customers.\nThe fourth area of our brand transformation strategy is enhancements to our communication and marketing programs. The program is designed to reshape consumer perceptions of the Ruby Tuesday brand and enhance our Fresh American Grill positioning by showcasing our brand personality in a fresh and energetic way, featuring compelling new food products, highlighting the freshness and variety of our Garden Bar, and effectively communicating value and affordability.\nThe four key areas of menu, service, atmosphere, and communication will continue to be foundational drivers of our brand transformation and key to building a stronger business model. We are hopeful that the culmination of the brand transformation strategy in conjunction with engaged restaurant and support teams will ultimately drive customer counts, sales, and average check.\nStrengthen our Balance Sheet to Facilitate Growth and Value Creation\nOur priority for the use of cash is to drive shareholder value. Our objective is to continue to maintain adequate cash levels to support business needs, while investing in our key brand transformation initiatives. Additionally, we will\nconsider other options such as reducing outstanding debt levels and share repurchases. Our success in the key strategic initiatives outlined above should enable us to improve both our returns on assets and equity and create additional shareholder value.\nResults of Operations\nRuby Tuesday Restaurants\nThe table below presents the number of Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> Company-Owned\n</td> <td> Domestic Franchise\n</td> <td> Franchise\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLime Fresh Restaurants\nThe table below presents the number of other concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> Company-Owned\n</td> <td> Franchise\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal year 2016:\n \u25cf Same-restaurant sales* at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 1.4%, while same-restaurant sales at domestic franchise Ruby Tuesday restaurants increased 3.7%; \nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> One Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened and 13 were closed\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Five franchised Ruby Tuesday restaurants were opened and five were closed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf We formulated a plan beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to restructure our property portfolio, which ultimately included the planned closing of approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016, resulting in additional impairment charges of $39.2 million in fiscal year 2016; \n \u25cf We entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants.

fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which are recorded as an offset to selling, general, and administrative expenses. \nThe Ruby Tuesday concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 decreased 2.7% to $1,070.7 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily a result of restaurant closings since the prior fiscal year coupled with a 1.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The decrease in Ruby Tuesday concept same-restaurant sales is attributable to a 3.9% decrease in customer traffic offset by a 2.5% increase in net check.\nThe Lime Fresh concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 decreased 26.2% to $14.4 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily due to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2015. As previously discussed within this MD&A, during the current fiscal year we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants.\nThe Ruby Tuesday concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 decreased 3.6% to $1,100.7 million compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease is primarily a result of restaurant closings since fiscal year 2014 coupled with a 0.5% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The decrease in Ruby Tuesday concept same-restaurant sales is attributable to a 1.4% decrease in customer traffic offset by a 1.0% increase in net check since fiscal year 2014.\nThe Lime Fresh concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 decreased 5.9% to $19.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease is due in part to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2014.\nFranchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business. Franchise royalties (generally 4.0% of monthly sales for franchised Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants and 5.25% of monthly sales for franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants) are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis. Franchise revenue decreased 3.6% to $6.2 million in fiscal year 2016 and increased 1.6% to $6.4 million in fiscal year 2015. Franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties, which totaled $5.9 million and $6.2 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTotal franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchise restaurant sales (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ruby Tuesday concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,668\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,233\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lime Fresh concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,310\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,493\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total franchise restaurant sales (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,711\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,726\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchise restaurant sales growth-percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes sales of all domestic and international franchised Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh restaurants. \nSegment Profit\nSegment profit/(loss) by reportable segment for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment profit/(loss):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ruby Tuesday concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,543 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lime Fresh concept\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,642 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,630 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,070 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment profit for the year ended May 31, 2016 for the Ruby Tuesday concept decreased $55.5 million to $60.9 million compared to fiscal year 2015 due primarily to a 1.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants, increases in closures and impairments expense of $49.3 million primarily as a result of the formulation of a plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016 coupled with higher impairments of poor performing open restaurants throughout the year as compared to the prior fiscal year, and increases in advertising spending of $1.9 million due primarily to higher internet, magazine, direct mail, and other promotional advertising costs offset by decreases in television advertising. These were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs as further discussed later within this MD&A, and decreases in general and administrative expenses of $4.7 million as a result of lower share-based compensation expense as further discussed later within this MD&A and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a lower accrual for executive bonus, and decreased management labor from reductions in staffing.\nSegment losses for the year ended May 31, 2016 for the Lime Fresh concept increased $2.0 million compared to fiscal year 2015 to $4.6 million due primarily to increases in closures and impairments expense of $3.3 million as the current fiscal year Lime Fresh segment losses include impairment and other charges for eleven Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants which closed during fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSegment profit for the year ended June 2, 2015 for the Ruby Tuesday concept increased $46.9 million to $116.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014 due primarily to reductions in cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs due to initiatives discussed later within this MD&A, and decreases in closures and impairments expense of $20.7 million and advertising expense of $17.5 million. The reduction in closures and impairments expense compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease of impairments in connection with open restaurants with deteriorating operational performance ($8.7 million), early restaurant closures ($5.4 million), and upcoming lease terminations ($1.4 million). The higher closures and impairments in fiscal year 2014 were primarily a result of prior fiscal year same-restaurant sales declines of 5.3% and the closure of 38 Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The reduction in advertising spending relates to reduced cable and television advertising.\nSegment losses for the year ended June 2, 2015 for the Lime Fresh concept decreased $3.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014 to $2.6 million due primarily to decreases in closures and impairments expense of $2.1 million as fiscal year 2014 Lime Fresh segment losses included lease reserve charges related to four undeveloped sites for which management decided to forego restaurant development and a lease reserve charge on a Lime Fresh restaurant contracted to be sold. This was coupled with reductions in cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs due to initiatives discussed later within this MD&A.\nThe following is a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,358 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,391 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,347 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,815 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,710 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,946 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preopening expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(290 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(395 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trademark impairments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,999 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(855 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,764 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,735 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,945 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(757 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,560 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(52,862 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,105 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,575 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Profit\nThe following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, for the periods indicated.

The increase in pre-tax loss is due primarily to higher closures and impairments expense ($52.1 million), a decrease in same-restaurant sales of 1.4% at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants, a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark ($2.0 million), and an increase, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, of costs of goods sold and payroll and related costs. These were partially offset by gain on sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill assets ($5.9 million), a decrease in interest expense, net ($1.0 million) and decreases, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, of other restaurant operating costs and selling, general and administrative, net.\nPre-tax loss from continuing operations decreased $64.5 million from fiscal year 2014 to $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015. The lower pre-tax loss is due to reductions in closures and impairments expense ($22.3 million) and interest expense ($2.2 million) and decreases, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, of cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, depreciation, and selling, general, and administrative, net. In addition, fiscal year 2014 included losses on the extinguishment of debt ($1.4 million) and a charge for the partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark ($0.9 million).\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre-tax loss from continuing operations for years ended May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015 as compared to the comparable prior year. Because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, and depreciation categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate, we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, as well as the absolute dollar change, to the comparable prior year.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased $6.8 million (2.2%) from the prior fiscal year to $298.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 27.3% to 27.5%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2016 was primarily the result of restaurant closures, a decline in same-restaurant sales, and $1.4 million in settlement proceeds from a class-action lawsuit against a former vendor, which were offset by price increases on certain commodity items since the prior fiscal year coupled with a shift in menu mix associated with menu changes introduced in November 2015.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the increase in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily the result of price increases on certain commodity items and a shift in menu mix since the prior fiscal year as discussed above.\nCost of goods sold decreased $16.2 million (5.0%) from fiscal year 2014 to $305.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, cost of goods sold decreased from 27.7% to 27.3%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 was the result of restaurant closures and cost savings on certain products due to renegotiated contracts with certain vendors since fiscal year 2014. These were partially offset by price increases on beef, seafood, poultry, and certain other products since fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the decrease in cost of goods sold for the year ended June 2, 2015 is primarily the result of renegotiated contracts with certain vendors since fiscal year 2014.\nPayroll and Related Costs\nPayroll and related costs decreased $8.7 million (2.3%) from the prior fiscal year to $374.6 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, payroll and related costs increased from 34.2% to 34.5%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended May 31, 2016 was primarily due to restaurant closures, reductions in overtime as a result of scheduling improvements, decreased management labor costs, and lower workers' compensation costs due to favorable claims experience since the prior fiscal year. These reductions were partially offset by higher health insurance due to unfavorable claims experience.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily the result wage inflation and loss of leveraging associated with lower sales volumes.\nPayroll and related costs decreased $21.1 million (5.2%) from fiscal year 2014 to $383.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, payroll and related costs decreased from 34.8% to 34.2%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 2, 2015 was primarily due to restaurant closures, decreases in hourly labor as a result of scheduling improvements with the rollout of a new labor forecasting system in our restaurants, and lower management labor, which were partially offset by higher health insurance costs as a result of unfavorable claims experience and higher bonus expense as more restaurants achieved the performance goals as compared to fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 2, 2015 was primarily the result of decreased hourly and management labor due to reasons discussed above.\nOther Restaurant Operating Costs\nOther restaurant operating costs decreased $12.6 million (5.2%) from the prior fiscal year to $229.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, other restaurant operating costs decreased from 21.6% to 21.2%.\nFor the year ended May 31, 2016, the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following (in thousands):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> Repairs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,607 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent and leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,693 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other decreases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and equipment losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(852 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended May 31, 2016, the decrease was a result of lower building repairs, utilities, and rent and leasing due in part to restaurant closures since the prior fiscal year, lower legal costs related to pending litigation, and insurance as a result of favorable general liability claims. These were partially offset by higher property and equipment losses due primarily to a Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurant that was destroyed by fire during the current fiscal year. In addition, the decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue was partially offset by loss of leveraging associated with lower sales volumes.\nOther restaurant operating costs decreased $15.8 million (6.1%) from the prior year to $242.1 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, other restaurant operating costs decreased from 22.2% to 21.6%.\nFor the year ended June 2, 2015, the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following (in thousands):\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> Repairs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent and leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,698 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gift card breakage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business interruption recoveries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other decreases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,010 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended June 2, 2015, the decrease in other operating costs was primarily a result of reduced building repairs, utilities, and rent and leasing due primarily to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2014, lower legal costs related to pending litigation, higher gift card breakage income, and business interruption recoveries related to claims collected for certain of our restaurants in\nthe Gulf Coast area. These changes were partially offset by higher insurance due in part to unfavorable general liability claims experience in fiscal year 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.0 million (2.0%) to $51.4 million for the year ended May 31, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, depreciation expense was consistent with the prior fiscal year at 4.7%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended May 31, 2016 is due primarily to assets that became fully depreciated or were impaired since the prior fiscal year coupled with restaurant closures.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $5.0 million (8.6%) to $52.4 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, compared to fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, depreciation expense decreased from 4.9% to 4.7%.\nIn terms of absolute dollars, the decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 is due primarily to assets that became fully depreciated since fiscal year 2014 coupled with restaurant closures.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, Net\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses, net decreased $5.7 million (4.9%) from the prior fiscal year to $109.6 million for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nThe decrease for the year ended May 31, 2016 is due to lower general and administrative costs ($7.7 million) offset by higher advertising costs ($2.0 million). The reduction in general and administrative costs is primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense as a result of a forfeiture credit as further discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the substantial completion during fiscal year 2015 of expense recognition related to our Chief Executive Officer's December 2012 inducement awards, a lower accrual for executive bonus, and decreased management labor from reductions in staffing. These were partially offset by higher employee pension-related costs, fees associated with certain service contracts, travel costs associated with restaurant manager training at our Restaurant Support Services Center, and consulting fees. The increase in advertising is primarily a result of higher internet, magazine, direct mail, and other promotional advertising costs offset by decreases in television advertising.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses, net decreased $21.8 million (15.9%) from fiscal year 2014 to $115.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015.\nThe decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 is due to lower advertising costs ($17.7 million) primarily as a result of decreased television advertising, and a reduction in general and administrative costs ($4.1 million) due to lower management labor from reductions in staffing, a decrease in consulting fees, and lower legal fees. The decrease in overall television advertising is attributable to management's desire to spend marketing dollars more efficiently, with an increased focus on supporting our national cable television advertising with print and electronic promotions. These were partially offset by higher accruals for support center bonus.\nClosures and Impairments, Net\nClosures and impairments, net increased $52.1 million to $62.7 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The $52.1 million increase is primarily due to higher property impairment charges ($48.3 million), closed restaurant lease reserve expense ($2.6 million), and other closing costs ($0.3 million), coupled with lower gains on the sale of surplus properties ($0.9 million).\nThe increase in closures and impairments for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily due to higher Ruby Tuesday concept property impairment charges coupled with $6.4 million of impairments, lease reserves, severance, and other charges associated with the closure of 11 Lime Fresh restaurants during the current fiscal year. As further discussed in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of the Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016. Given the status of the plan as of May 31, 2016, we concluded that there was an impairment trigger as certain restaurants would be disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $39.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 related to\nthese restaurants. Also included within Closures and impairments, net for fiscal year 2016 are impairments of $14.7 million related to open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants with deteriorating operational performance during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016 or not included within management's developing closure plan during the fourth fiscal quarter, $3.4 million related to Lime Fresh Mexican Grill concept restaurants, and $0.8 million related to surplus properties.\nClosures and impairments, net decreased $22.3 million to $10.5 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower property impairment charges ($14.5 million), closed restaurant lease reserve expense ($5.8 million), and other closing costs ($1.2 million) coupled with higher gains on the sale of surplus properties ($0.7 million).\nThe decrease in closures and impairments for the year ended June 2, 2015 is primarily due to lower property impairment charges as the same periods of the prior fiscal year included, among other charges, larger impairments attributable to open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants experiencing deteriorating operational performance and related to early restaurant closures. Fiscal year 2014 charges were also higher due to a plan to close approximately 30 Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants by the end of that fiscal year.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014. Further information regarding closures and impairments expense for the Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh concepts for all periods presented is contained in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTrademark Impairments\nAs previously discussed within this MD&A, during fiscal year 2016 we entered into an agreement to sell eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. In connection with these events, we concluded that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million representing a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we concluded that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired by using entity specific projections for undiscounted cash flows that incorporated only those Lime Fresh assets existing as of the measurement date. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $0.9 million representing a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark.\nAs further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As a result of this transaction, our Lime Fresh trademark had no net book value remaining at May 31, 2016. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our trademark impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2016 and 2014.\nGain on Sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill Assets\nAs previously discussed within this MD&A and further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, after which we were paid $5.0 million. One of the remaining two restaurants closed and transferred to the buyer shortly after our fiscal year-end, and the other restaurant is expected to close and transfer to the buyer on or before the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The remaining $1.0 million of consideration will be received when the remaining restaurant has transferred to the buyer. We recognized during fiscal year 2016 a gain of $3.1 million on this transaction. All of the eight restaurants involved in this transaction will be rebranded by the buyer as a different restaurant concept.\nAlso during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million. We recognized a gain of $2.8 million on this transaction.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.0 million to $21.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest resulting from the early payoff of certain mortgage loans and repurchases of our Senior Notes since the prior fiscal year. Partially offsetting these decreases were $0.6 million in increased prepayment premiums paid in connection with mortgage obligations that we prepaid and retired in fiscal year 2016 above those paid in the previous fiscal year.\nInterest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $22.7 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, primarily due to lower interest expense on our Senior Notes due to repurchases during fiscal year 2014 and the early payoff of certain mortgage loans since fiscal year 2014.\n(Gain)/Loss on Extinguishment of Debt\nUnder the terms of the Senior Credit Facility we are allowed, under certain circumstances, to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Senior Notes in any fiscal year. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $1.4 million for the year ended June 3, 2014 due to our repurchase of $20.0 million of the Senior Notes for $20.0 million plus $0.2 million of accrued interest. We realized losses of $0.7 million on these transactions. Additionally, we incurred a $0.7 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 relating to the write-off of the pro rata portion of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the previous credit facility.\nBenefit for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations\nWe recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $2.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, compared to a tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015. Included in our $1.9 million tax benefit for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 was a benefit of $3.2 million recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, representing an immaterial prior period correction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015, compared to a tax benefit from continuing operations of $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 3, 2014. Included in our $1.9 million tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended June 2, 2015 was the previously mentioned benefit of $3.2 million, with the remaining $1.3 million in net expense is attributable to decreased pre-tax losses and changes in uncertain tax reserves for fiscal year 2015.\nWe regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the deferred tax assets in the future. A valuation allowance assessment is performed each reporting period, with any additions or adjustments reflected in earnings in the period of assessment. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction.\nOur valuation allowance for deferred tax assets totaled $89.9 million and $62.8 million as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively. Included within our income tax benefit from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of $28.2 million, $9.1 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, representing the amount reserved for the increase in net deferred tax assets during the periods (primarily related to general business credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards). Additionally, a valuation allowance benefit of $0.3 million was included within the income tax benefit from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014.\nUnder ASC 740, we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. As a result of, among other charges, closures and impairments and trademark impairment charges, we currently reflect a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss. A cumulative pre-tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income, and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome. Before consideration of the valuation\nallowance expense, we had an income tax benefit of $30.4 million, $11.0 million, and $35.9 million, including the tax credits, in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn an effort to focus primarily on the sales turnaround of our core Ruby Tuesday concept and secondly, to improve the financial performance of our then Lime Fresh concept, we completed the closure of our Marlin & Ray's, Wok Hay, and Truffles restaurants during fiscal year 2013. We have classified the results of operations of our Company-owned Marlin & Ray's, Wok Hay, and Truffles concepts as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended June 3, 2014. The results of operations of our discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> June 3, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant sales and operating revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>564 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in thousands).\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,755 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,497 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,203 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,352 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,409 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,753 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease)/ increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,990 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,581 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees. Substantially all of the $1,085.0 million, $1,120.1 million, and $1,162.4 million of restaurant sales and operating revenue disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, was received in cash either at the point of sale or within two to four days (when our customers paid with debit or credit cards). Our primary uses of cash for operating activities are food and beverage purchases, payroll and benefit costs, restaurant operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and marketing, a significant portion of which are incurred and paid in the same period.\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 decreased $14.8 million (27.0%) from the prior fiscal year to $40.1 million. The decrease is primarily the result of lower Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), increases in amounts spent to acquire inventory, decreases in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities due to the timing of payments, and an increase in cash paid for taxes ($2.8 million). These were partially offset by lower cash paid for interest ($1.0 million) due to the prepayment of certain of our mortgage obligations and other principal payments on our debt since the prior fiscal year and a decrease in amounts spent on media advertising (approximately $1.7 million).\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 increased $9.5 million (21.0%) from fiscal year 2014 to $54.9 million. The increase is primarily the result of higher EBITDA due in part to restaurant-level cost improvements and reductions in amounts spent on media advertising. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities due to the timing of payments (approximately $11.4 million) and inventory (approximately $8.9 million) as amounts for fiscal year 2014 related to levels of lobster held in inventory that were significantly lower than those of the preceding year.\nOur working capital and current ratio as of May 31, 2016 were $23.2 million and 1.2:1, respectively. While we typically carry current liabilities in excess of current assets as is common in the restaurant industry, we have reduced our accounts payable and other accrued liabilities since the prior fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nWe require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants, limited new restaurant construction, investments in technology, equipment, remodeling of existing restaurants, and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts. Property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, and/or proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $34.4 million, $31.0 million, and $28.3 million, respectively. In addition, proceeds from the disposal of assets produced $11.7 million, $11.3 million, and $15.5 million of cash in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, following actions taken to more aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt and, for fiscal year 2016, to substantially exit the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 3, 2014, we completed sale-leaseback transactions of the land and building for three Company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants for gross cash proceeds of $5.9 million, exclusive of transaction costs of approximately $0.3 million. Equipment was not included. The net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions were used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, debt payments, and, in fiscal years prior to 2014, the repurchase of shares of our common stock. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are estimated to be in the range of between $38.0 million to $42.0 million. We intend to fund our investing activities with cash currently on hand, cash provided by operations, proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, or borrowings on the Senior Credit Facility.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities, coupled with sale-leaseback transactions and sales of surplus properties. When these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs, we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock.\nOur current borrowings and credit facilities include $212.5 million outstanding principal of 7.625% senior notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes\u201d), a four year revolving credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility\u201d) under which we may borrow up to $50.0 million, and $15.7 million of mortgage loan obligations acquired upon franchise acquisitions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for key terms and further information on our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and mortgage loan obligations.\nUnder the terms of the Senior Credit Facility we are allowed, under certain circumstances, to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Senior Notes in any fiscal year. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions. We did not repurchase any Senior Notes during the year ended June 2, 2015. During the year ended June 3, 2014, we repurchased $20.0 million of the Senior Notes for $20.0 million plus $0.2 million of accrued interest. We realized losses of $0.7 million on these transactions.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we prepaid and retired 16 mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $13.3 million using cash on hand. We paid $1.6 million in prepayment premiums and $0.1 million of accrued interest in connection with the retirement of these obligations. The prepayment of this debt eliminated one mortgage lender and allowed for the release of 44 properties which had served as collateral. Additionally, during fiscal year 2015, we prepaid and retired ten mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $9.0 million using cash on hand. In connection with the retirement of these obligations, we paid $1.0 million in prepayment premiums and an insignificant amount of accrued interest.\nDuring fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we repurchased 1.9 million, an insignificant number, and 0.1 million shares of RTI common stock, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2016, the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased was 9.9 million. Additionally, there were no dividends paid during fiscal years 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nSignificant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nLong-term financial obligations were as follows as of May 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> long-term debt, including\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> current maturities (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>613,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension obligations (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (f)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,007,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>313,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>438,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt. \n (b) Amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed-rate debt instruments. Additionally, the amounts shown above include interest payments on the Senior Notes at the current interest rate of 7.625%. \n (c) This amount includes lease payments for certain optional renewal periods for which exercise is considered reasonably assured as well as operating leases totaling $4.3 million for which sublease income from franchisees or others is expected. Certain of these leases obligate us to pay maintenance costs, utilities, real estate taxes, and insurance, which are excluded from the amounts shown above. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n (d) The amounts for purchase obligations include cash commitments under contract for food items and supplies, advertising, utility contracts, and other miscellaneous commitments. \n (e) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n (f) This amount excludes $4.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. \nCommercial commitments were as follows as of May 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Divestiture guarantees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,154 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease guarantee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,846 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt May 31, 2016, we had divestiture guarantees, which arose in fiscal 1996, when our shareholders approved the distribution of our family dining restaurant business (Morrison Fresh Cooking, Inc., MFC\u201d) and our health care food and nutrition services business (Morrison Health Care, Inc., MHC\u201d). Subsequent to that date Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc. ( Piccadilly\u201d) acquired MFC and Compass Group ( Compass\u201d) acquired MHC. As agreed upon at the time of the distribution, we have been contingently liable for payments to MFC and MHC employees retiring under MFC's and MHC's versions of the Management Retirement Plan and the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan (the two non-qualified defined benefit plans) for the accrued benefits earned by those participants as of March 1996.\nWe estimated our divestiture guarantees at May 31, 2016 to be $6.8 million for employee benefit plans (all of which resides with MHC following Piccadilly's bankruptcy in fiscal 2004). We believe the likelihood of being required to make payments for MHC's portion to be remote due to the size and financial strength of MHC and Compass.\nAs of May 31, 2016, we are the guarantor of nine third-party leases associated with closed concept restaurants. Lease guarantee amounts in the table above represent lease payments for which we are contingently liable. While we believe that the likelihood of being required to make these lease payments is remote, we recorded a guarantee liability of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our operating leases.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding accounting pronouncements not yet adopted is incorporated by reference from Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur MD&A is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we consider the forecasted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the restaurant, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Fair value is market participant-based upon broker estimates of the value of land, building, leasehold improvements, and other residual assets, or estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value.\nUnder our policies, recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment. If a restaurant that has been open for at least six full quarters shows negative cash flow results, we evaluate the plan to reverse the negative performance. Both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments. We also perform tests for impairment of intangible assets when other events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired.\nAs discussed in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in response to a comprehensive review by management of our property portfolio, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested a significant number of open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants for impairment as we concluded it was more likely than not they would close significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life. We evaluated recoverability based on the restaurants forecasted undiscounted cash flows for 107 restaurants, which incorporated probability weighted scenarios of either remaining open or closing in the near term. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the probability weighted scenarios changing by 10% and the results were not materially different. For restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we wrote those assets down to estimated fair value. As a result of this analysis, the Company incurred $39.2 million of impairment charges during fiscal year 2016. We also tested the Lime Fresh trademark for impairment during fiscal years 2016 and 2014 as factors were present which indicated the trademark may be impaired. We determined that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired and recorded charges of $2.0 million and $0.9 million during fiscal years 2016 and 2014, respectively.\nAt May 31, 2016, we had 75 restaurants that had been open for more than six full quarters with rolling 12-month negative cash flows of which 67 are expected to close by September 2016 either as part of the asset rationalization plan as previously discussed or as leases expire. Of the eight restaurants which remained, we recorded impairments for five properties based on their estimated values and we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at the remaining\nthree properties and determined that no impairments were necessary. The remaining net book value of the eight restaurants was $2.2 million at May 31, 2016.\nShould cash flows at these cash flow negative restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time, further impairment charges may occur. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, including cash flows from continuing use, terminal value, closure costs, salvage value, and sublease income. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from our estimates.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Accruals\nWe record deferred tax assets for various items and a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets when current available information raises doubt as to their ultimate realization. Despite the existence of long carryforward periods for some of our largest deferred tax assets, such as unused employment tax credits and federal and/or state net operating losses, and a history of realizing our deferred tax assets by utilizing those credits and losses in subsequent or carryback years, a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss is an example of negative evidence that raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets. To determine the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, we schedule a year-by-year estimation of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in order to determine the availability of future taxable income which would allow for the realization of our existing deferred tax assets. While we are able to incorporate tax planning strategies into our analysis, we do not factor projected future income until such time that the positive evidence supporting realization outweighs the negative evidence (most significantly, the three-year cumulative pre-tax loss).\nWe recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $89.9 million and $62.8 million as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively. Included within our income tax benefit from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of $28.2 million, $9.1 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Additionally, a valuation allowance benefit of $0.3 million was included in income tax benefit from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014. Given that we last recorded pre-tax income in fiscal 2011, we will likely not be able to reverse the significant valuation allowance recorded in the near future. Our recorded valuation allowance may be subject to material changes in the future, as our ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Upon such time that we are able to reverse the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, income tax expense will be reduced, and net income will correspondingly be increased, by the amount we are able to reverse.\nLease Obligations\nWe lease a significant number of our restaurant properties. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease. The term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. The primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with our investment into leasehold improvements which might become impaired should we choose not to continue the use of the leased property.\nOur operating lease term used for straight-line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the end of the lease term. There is potential for variability in our rent holiday\u201d period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments. Factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction-related delays. Extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period.\nFor operating leases that contain predetermined fixed rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as determined above, on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday\u201d period beginning upon possession of the premises), and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments, called \"contingent rents,\" when the associated restaurants' sales volumes exceed agreed-upon levels. We recognize contingent rental expense (in annual as well as interim periods) prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense, provided that achievement of that target is considered probable.\nThe judgment regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease impacts the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday and/or escalation in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant amortized. The material factor we consider when making this judgment is the total amount invested in the restaurant at the inception of the lease and whether management believes that renewal appears reasonably assured. While a different term may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization, and rent expense than reported, our historical lease renewal rates support the judgments made. We have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for leases in any of the fiscal years presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe record the estimated future lease obligations on leased restaurants upon closure for which we have not sublet or settled the lease with the respective landlord as of a quarter end date. Inherent in these estimates is an assumption on the time period we anticipate it will take to reach a settlement with our landlord or to execute on a sublease agreement. We calculate the lease obligation as the present value of future minimum net lease or settlement payments using a discount rate that takes into account the remaining time period prior to the estimated date of resolution. As further discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our estimated lease obligations for closed restaurants as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015 were $6.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively.\nEstimated Liability for Self-Insurance\nWe self-insure a portion of our expected losses under our employee health care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability, and property insurance programs. Specifically with our workers' compensation and general liability coverages, we have stop loss insurance for individual claims in excess of stated loss amounts. Insurance liabilities are recorded based on third-party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses, net of payments made. The estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the Company and supplemental information as appropriate.\nThe analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including, but not limited to, (a) the quality of historical loss and exposure information, (b) the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience, (c) the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the Company, and (d) projected payrolls and revenue. As claims develop, the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates. Therefore, an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required.\nKnown Events, Uncertainties, and Trends\nUpcoming Restaurant Closures\nAs discussed previously within this MD&A and discussed further in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of our Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016. The approved closures, which include mall, in line, and freestanding sites, encompass restaurants spread throughout all of the geographies in which the Company operates. Of the restaurants expected to close, approximately two-thirds are operated on leased properties and approximately one-third are owned.\nWe incurred $39.2 million of impairment charges in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2016 following an impairment analysis performed for the restaurants deemed, as of May 31, 2016, to be more than likely to be closed significantly prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives based on the then status of management's developing plan. In addition to the impairment charges recorded during fiscal year 2016, further impairment charges will be incurred based on changes ultimately made to the plan after May 31, 2016 and as the restaurants actually close. Accordingly, the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017 closures and impairments are expected to include additional impairment charges of approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million for restaurants added to management's plan subsequent to May 31, 2016, approximately $19.0 million to $21.0 million associated with estimated lease settlement costs and approximately $11.0 million to $16.0 million in severance benefits, inventory write-off and other costs. The actual amount of any cash payments made by the Company for lease contract termination costs will be dependent upon ongoing negotiations with the landlords of the leased restaurant properties and could be higher or lower than the amounts currently estimated.\nFinancial Strategy and Stock Repurchase Plan\nCash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2016 were $67.3 million. Our overall goal is to invest in our brand and to strengthen our balance sheet to improve credit metrics. As such, our first priority is to ensure that we have adequate cash levels to run the business and internally fund our capital expenditures. Our second priority is to reduce our outstanding debt to help improve our credit metrics with the goal of improved flexibility and access to capital at reasonable rates. Lastly, we would consider share repurchases within the limitations of our debt covenants to return capital to shareholders. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million. As of May 31, 2016, the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased was 9.9 million. Any of these actions, in any particular period and the actual amount thereof, remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that any such actions will be taken in the future.\nRepurchases of Senior Notes\nWe are allowed under the terms of the Senior Credit Facility to repurchase, in any fiscal year, up to $20.0 million of indebtedness to various holders of the Senior Notes. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions. As of the date of this filing, we may repurchase $20.0 million of the Senior Notes during the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Future repurchases of the Senior Notes, if any, will be funded with available cash on hand.\nDividends\nDuring fiscal 1997, our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders. No dividends were declared or paid during the three year period ended May 31, 2016. The payment of a dividend in any particular period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year 2017 will contain 53 weeks and end on June 6, 2017.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation on the cost of food, labor, supplies, utilities, real estate, and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results. Historically, we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements. Competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases. Historically, the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nRuby Tuesday, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( RTI,\u201d the Company,\u201d we\u201d and/or our\u201d), owns and operates Ruby Tuesday\u00ae casual dining restaurants. We also franchise the Ruby Tuesday concept in select domestic and international markets. As of May 31, 2016, we owned and operated 646 Ruby Tuesday restaurants located in 38 states. Our franchisees operated 27 domestic and 51 international Ruby Tuesday restaurants in 12 states, Guam, and 14 foreign countries. The Company-owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions of the United States. We consider these regions to be our core markets.\nOn August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of the Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants with perceived limited upside due to market concentration, challenged trade areas, and other factors by September 2016. The plan is designed to streamline the organization through asset rationalization, improve financial profitability, and ultimately create long-term value for shareholders. The approved closures, which include mall, in line, and freestanding sites, encompass restaurants spread throughout all of the geographic regions in which we operate. Of the restaurants expected to close, approximately two-thirds are operated on leased properties and approximately one-third are owned. As discussed further in the Known Events, Uncertainties, and Trends section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d), our fiscal year 2017 results of operations are expected to include additional charges for impairment, estimated lease settlement costs, and severance benefits, inventory write-off and other costs related to the 95 restaurants.\nAlso, as further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh Mexican Grill\u00ae ( Lime Fresh\u201d) restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, after which we were paid $5.0 million. One of the remaining two restaurants closed and transferred to the buyer on June 14, 2016. The remaining restaurant is expected to close and transfer to the buyer on or before the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. All of the eight restaurants involved in this transaction will be rebranded by the buyer as a different restaurant concept. Also during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million. As a result of this transaction, we had no remaining Lime Fresh concept franchisees as of May 31, 2016.\nOur same-restaurant sales for Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 1.4% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, and our diluted loss per share was $0.83 in fiscal year 2016 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.05 in fiscal year 2015. Throughout this MD&A, we discuss our fiscal year 2016 financial results in detail, provide insight for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, as well as discuss known events, uncertainties, and trends. We believe our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance. We remind you, that, in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years, this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReferences to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor's understanding of the franchise system, which includes our traditional domestic and international franchisees. Franchise system revenue is not included in, and is not, revenue of Ruby Tuesday, Inc. However, we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities, which includes royalties. Franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor.\nOverview and Strategies\nThe bar and grill segment of the casual dining industry in which we primarily operate is intensely competitive with respect to prices, services, convenience, locations, employees, advertising and promotion, and the types and quality of food. We compete with other food service operations, including locally-owned restaurants, and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do. We continue to believe there are opportunities to grow same-restaurant sales, strengthen our competitive position, enhance our profitability, and create value through the execution of the following strategies:\nEnhancing Our Business Model\nOver the past few fiscal years, we have developed strategies to reduce our overall cost structure in the areas of cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In April 2014, we implemented a new labor management system to facilitate more efficient staffing that is contributing to lower labor costs. We have also implemented enhanced business processes and capabilities, such as an inventory/food waste management system that should benefit our business model by reducing food waste and manager time on inventory management leading to a better customer experience and improved profitability.\nEnhance Sales and Margins Through Repositioning of Our Core Brand\nWe are in the process of executing a strategic brand transformation of the Ruby Tuesday concept which is designed to make our brand more energetic, affordable, and broadly appealing. We believe the execution of this strategy provides opportunities for increased same-restaurant customer counts and sales growth, and increased shareholder value. Our brand transformation is supported by enhancements in the following areas: food, service, atmosphere, and communication.\nAs part of our transformation strategy, we have taken what we believe to be meaningful steps to improve our food, customer experience, organizational capabilities, and business model. We continue to transform our menu to be broadly appealing, approachable, and affordable by offering compelling value throughout the menu at a wide-range of price points. Additionally, we are testing an initiative to enhance our Garden Bar which we believe is a differentiator for our brand and utilized by approximately half of our guests. Our intent is to incorporate customer feedback to continue to evolve our food offering as well as to promote menu items that customers find highly satisfying.\nEnhancing our service is also a critical component of our brand transformation strategy. In January 2015, we rolled-out a new service training platform which encourages our restaurant teams to provide a genuine, customized experience to our customers while also reinforcing techniques to build add-on sales for beverages, appetizers and desserts. We believe that there are additional opportunities to improve the guest experience by simplifying the menu, recipes, and operating processes which could result in a better and more consistent service execution and guest experience.\nTo further enhance the atmosphere of our restaurants, we are currently developing a remodel plan and began testing prototypes in fiscal year 2016 to determine sales building potential, cost effectiveness, and return on investment. These changes are designed to create an improved dining atmosphere for our customers.\nThe fourth area of our brand transformation strategy is enhancements to our communication and marketing programs. The program is designed to reshape consumer perceptions of the Ruby Tuesday brand and enhance our Fresh American Grill positioning by showcasing our brand personality in a fresh and energetic way, featuring compelling new food products, highlighting the freshness and variety of our Garden Bar, and effectively communicating value and affordability.\nThe four key areas of menu, service, atmosphere, and communication will continue to be foundational drivers of our brand transformation and key to building a stronger business model. We are hopeful that the culmination of the brand transformation strategy in conjunction with engaged restaurant and support teams will ultimately drive customer counts, sales, and average check.\nStrengthen our Balance Sheet to Facilitate Growth and Value Creation\nOur priority for the use of cash is to drive shareholder value. Our objective is to continue to maintain adequate cash levels to support business needs, while investing in our key brand transformation initiatives. Additionally, we will\nconsider other options such as reducing outstanding debt levels and share repurchases. Our success in the key strategic initiatives outlined above should enable us to improve both our returns on assets and equity and create additional shareholder value.\nResults of Operations\nRuby Tuesday Restaurants\nThe table below presents the number of Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016:\n\nLime Fresh Restaurants\nThe table below presents the number of other concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016:\n\nDuring fiscal year 2016:\n \u25cf Same-restaurant sales* at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 1.4%, while same-restaurant sales at domestic franchise Ruby Tuesday restaurants increased 3.7%; \n\n \u25cf We formulated a plan beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to restructure our property portfolio, which ultimately included the planned closing of approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016, resulting in additional impairment charges of $39.2 million in fiscal year 2016; \n \u25cf We entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during fiscal year 2016, while two remained pending. We also sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million; \n \u25cf We prepaid and retired 16 mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $13.3 million plus prepayment penalties of $1.6 million and $0.1 million of accrued interest; \n \u25cf We repurchased and retired 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million; \n \u25cf We repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes. The repurchases settled for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions; \n \u25cf On April 11, 2016, Jill M. Golder voluntarily resigned as the Company's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. On June 2, 2016, Sue Briley was appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer; \n \u25cf On April 7, 2016, Tom Williams, an executive with over 30 years of experience in executing and leading human resources functions, was appointed Chief People Officer; \n \u25cf Mike K. Ellis, an executive with more than 30 years of restaurant industry experience and 24 years of restaurant development experience, predominantly in casual dining, was appointed Chief Development Officer on February 29, 2016; \n \u25cf On July 25, 2015, Todd A. Burrowes voluntarily resigned as the Company's President, Ruby Tuesday Concept and Chief Operations Officer. On July 27, 2015, Brett A. Patterson, an executive with over 25 years of restaurant industry experience who was then our Senior Vice President of Operations, was appointed Ruby Tuesday Concept President; and \n \u25cf On July 21, 2015, David W. Skena, an executive with over 20 years of marketing experience, was appointed Chief Marketing Officer. \nDuring fiscal year 2015:\n \u25cf Same-restaurant sales* at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants decreased 0.5%, while same-restaurant sales at domestic franchise Ruby Tuesday restaurants increased 4.7%; \n \u25cf One Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened and 11 were closed; \n \u25cf Six franchised Ruby Tuesday restaurants were opened and seven were closed; \n \u25cf One Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurant was closed; \n \u25cf Two franchised Lime Fresh restaurants were opened and one was closed; \n \u25cf We prepaid and retired ten mortgage loan obligations for $9.0 million plus prepayment penalties of $1.0 million and negligible accrued interest; \n \u25cf Rhonda J. Parish was appointed Chief Legal Officer on March 16, 2015 and Secretary on April 8, 2015; \n* We define same-restaurant sales as a year-over-year comparison of sales volumes for restaurants that, in the current year have been open at least 18 months, in order to remove the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants.\nRestaurant Sales\nRestaurant sales in fiscal year 2016 decreased 3.1% from fiscal year 2015 for Company-owned restaurants and decreased 5.0% for domestic and international franchised restaurants as explained below. The tables presented below reflect restaurant sales and other revenue information for the last three fiscal years.\nRestaurant Sales (in millions):\n\n (a) Includes sales of all domestic and international franchised Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh restaurants. \nOther Revenue Information:\n\n\n\n (a) Franchise revenue includes royalty, license, and development fees, but is exclusive of support service fees of $0.9 million, $1.3 million, and $1.0 million, in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which are recorded as an offset to selling, general, and administrative expenses. \nThe Ruby Tuesday concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 decreased 2.7% to $1,070.7 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily a result of restaurant closings since the prior fiscal year coupled with a 1.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The decrease in Ruby Tuesday concept same-restaurant sales is attributable to a 3.9% decrease in customer traffic offset by a 2.5% increase in net check.\nThe Lime Fresh concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 decreased 26.2% to $14.4 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily due to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2015. As previously discussed within this MD&A, during the current fiscal year we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants.\nThe Ruby Tuesday concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 decreased 3.6% to $1,100.7 million compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease is primarily a result of restaurant closings since fiscal year 2014 coupled with a 0.5% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The decrease in Ruby Tuesday concept same-restaurant sales is attributable to a 1.4% decrease in customer traffic offset by a 1.0% increase in net check since fiscal year 2014.\nThe Lime Fresh concept restaurant sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 decreased 5.9% to $19.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease is due in part to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2014.\nFranchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business. Franchise royalties (generally 4.0% of monthly sales for franchised Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants and 5.25% of monthly sales for franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants) are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis. Franchise revenue decreased 3.6% to $6.2 million in fiscal year 2016 and increased 1.6% to $6.4 million in fiscal year 2015. Franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties, which totaled $5.9 million and $6.2 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTotal franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below.\n\n (a) Includes sales of all domestic and international franchised Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh restaurants. \nSegment Profit\nSegment profit/(loss) by reportable segment for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 is as follows (in thousands):\n\nSegment profit for the year ended May 31, 2016 for the Ruby Tuesday concept decreased $55.5 million to $60.9 million compared to fiscal year 2015 due primarily to a 1.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants, increases in closures and impairments expense of $49.3 million primarily as a result of the formulation of a plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016 coupled with higher impairments of poor performing open restaurants throughout the year as compared to the prior fiscal year, and increases in advertising spending of $1.9 million due primarily to higher internet, magazine, direct mail, and other promotional advertising costs offset by decreases in television advertising. These were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs as further discussed later within this MD&A, and decreases in general and administrative expenses of $4.7 million as a result of lower share-based compensation expense as further discussed later within this MD&A and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a lower accrual for executive bonus, and decreased management labor from reductions in staffing.\nSegment losses for the year ended May 31, 2016 for the Lime Fresh concept increased $2.0 million compared to fiscal year 2015 to $4.6 million due primarily to increases in closures and impairments expense of $3.3 million as the current fiscal year Lime Fresh segment losses include impairment and other charges for eleven Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants which closed during fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSegment profit for the year ended June 2, 2015 for the Ruby Tuesday concept increased $46.9 million to $116.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014 due primarily to reductions in cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs due to initiatives discussed later within this MD&A, and decreases in closures and impairments expense of $20.7 million and advertising expense of $17.5 million. The reduction in closures and impairments expense compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease of impairments in connection with open restaurants with deteriorating operational performance ($8.7 million), early restaurant closures ($5.4 million), and upcoming lease terminations ($1.4 million). The higher closures and impairments in fiscal year 2014 were primarily a result of prior fiscal year same-restaurant sales declines of 5.3% and the closure of 38 Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The reduction in advertising spending relates to reduced cable and television advertising.\nSegment losses for the year ended June 2, 2015 for the Lime Fresh concept decreased $3.4 million compared to fiscal year 2014 to $2.6 million due primarily to decreases in closures and impairments expense of $2.1 million as fiscal year 2014 Lime Fresh segment losses included lease reserve charges related to four undeveloped sites for which management decided to forego restaurant development and a lease reserve charge on a Lime Fresh restaurant contracted to be sold. This was coupled with reductions in cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, and other restaurant operating costs due to initiatives discussed later within this MD&A.\nThe following is a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Profit\nThe following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, for the periods indicated. All information is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(1) As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue.\nPre-tax Loss from Continuing Operations\nPre-tax loss from continuing operations increased $47.8 million from fiscal year 2015 to $52.9 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. The increase in pre-tax loss is due primarily to higher closures and impairments expense ($52.1 million), a decrease in same-restaurant sales of 1.4% at Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants, a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark ($2.0 million), and an increase, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, of costs of goods sold and payroll and related costs. These were partially offset by gain on sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill assets ($5.9 million), a decrease in interest expense, net ($1.0 million) and decreases, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, of other restaurant operating costs and selling, general and administrative, net.\nPre-tax loss from continuing operations decreased $64.5 million from fiscal year 2014 to $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015. The lower pre-tax loss is due to reductions in closures and impairments expense ($22.3 million) and interest expense ($2.2 million) and decreases, as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue, as appropriate, of cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, depreciation, and selling, general, and administrative, net. In addition, fiscal year 2014 included losses on the extinguishment of debt ($1.4 million) and a charge for the partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark ($0.9 million).\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre-tax loss from continuing operations for years ended May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015 as compared to the comparable prior year. Because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of goods sold, payroll and related costs, other restaurant operating costs, and depreciation categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate, we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, as well as the absolute dollar change, to the comparable prior year.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased $6.8 million (2.2%) from the prior fiscal year to $298.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 27.3% to 27.5%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2016 was primarily the result of restaurant closures, a decline in same-restaurant sales, and $1.4 million in settlement proceeds from a class-action lawsuit against a former vendor, which were offset by price increases on certain commodity items since the prior fiscal year coupled with a shift in menu mix associated with menu changes introduced in November 2015.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the increase in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily the result of price increases on certain commodity items and a shift in menu mix since the prior fiscal year as discussed above.\nCost of goods sold decreased $16.2 million (5.0%) from fiscal year 2014 to $305.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, cost of goods sold decreased from 27.7% to 27.3%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 was the result of restaurant closures and cost savings on certain products due to renegotiated contracts with certain vendors since fiscal year 2014. These were partially offset by price increases on beef, seafood, poultry, and certain other products since fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the decrease in cost of goods sold for the year ended June 2, 2015 is primarily the result of renegotiated contracts with certain vendors since fiscal year 2014.\nPayroll and Related Costs\nPayroll and related costs decreased $8.7 million (2.3%) from the prior fiscal year to $374.6 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, payroll and related costs increased from 34.2% to 34.5%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended May 31, 2016 was primarily due to restaurant closures, reductions in overtime as a result of scheduling improvements, decreased management labor costs, and lower workers' compensation costs due to favorable claims experience since the prior fiscal year. These reductions were partially offset by higher health insurance due to unfavorable claims experience.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily the result wage inflation and loss of leveraging associated with lower sales volumes.\nPayroll and related costs decreased $21.1 million (5.2%) from fiscal year 2014 to $383.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, payroll and related costs decreased from 34.8% to 34.2%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 2, 2015 was primarily due to restaurant closures, decreases in hourly labor as a result of scheduling improvements with the rollout of a new labor forecasting system in our restaurants, and lower management labor, which were partially offset by higher health insurance costs as a result of unfavorable claims experience and higher bonus expense as more restaurants achieved the performance goals as compared to fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, the decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 2, 2015 was primarily the result of decreased hourly and management labor due to reasons discussed above.\nOther Restaurant Operating Costs\nOther restaurant operating costs decreased $12.6 million (5.2%) from the prior fiscal year to $229.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, other restaurant operating costs decreased from 21.6% to 21.2%.\nFor the year ended May 31, 2016, the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following (in thousands):\n\nIn both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended May 31, 2016, the decrease was a result of lower building repairs, utilities, and rent and leasing due in part to restaurant closures since the prior fiscal year, lower legal costs related to pending litigation, and insurance as a result of favorable general liability claims. These were partially offset by higher property and equipment losses due primarily to a Company-owned Ruby Tuesday restaurant that was destroyed by fire during the current fiscal year. In addition, the decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue was partially offset by loss of leveraging associated with lower sales volumes.\nOther restaurant operating costs decreased $15.8 million (6.1%) from the prior year to $242.1 million for the year ended June 2, 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, other restaurant operating costs decreased from 22.2% to 21.6%.\nFor the year ended June 2, 2015, the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following (in thousands):\n\nIn both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended June 2, 2015, the decrease in other operating costs was primarily a result of reduced building repairs, utilities, and rent and leasing due primarily to restaurant closures since fiscal year 2014, lower legal costs related to pending litigation, higher gift card breakage income, and business interruption recoveries related to claims collected for certain of our restaurants in\nthe Gulf Coast area. These changes were partially offset by higher insurance due in part to unfavorable general liability claims experience in fiscal year 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.0 million (2.0%) to $51.4 million for the year ended May 31, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, depreciation expense was consistent with the prior fiscal year at 4.7%.\nThe absolute dollar decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended May 31, 2016 is due primarily to assets that became fully depreciated or were impaired since the prior fiscal year coupled with restaurant closures.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $5.0 million (8.6%) to $52.4 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, compared to fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue, depreciation expense decreased from 4.9% to 4.7%.\nIn terms of absolute dollars, the decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 is due primarily to assets that became fully depreciated since fiscal year 2014 coupled with restaurant closures.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, Net\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses, net decreased $5.7 million (4.9%) from the prior fiscal year to $109.6 million for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nThe decrease for the year ended May 31, 2016 is due to lower general and administrative costs ($7.7 million) offset by higher advertising costs ($2.0 million). The reduction in general and administrative costs is primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense as a result of a forfeiture credit as further discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the substantial completion during fiscal year 2015 of expense recognition related to our Chief Executive Officer's December 2012 inducement awards, a lower accrual for executive bonus, and decreased management labor from reductions in staffing. These were partially offset by higher employee pension-related costs, fees associated with certain service contracts, travel costs associated with restaurant manager training at our Restaurant Support Services Center, and consulting fees. The increase in advertising is primarily a result of higher internet, magazine, direct mail, and other promotional advertising costs offset by decreases in television advertising.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses, net decreased $21.8 million (15.9%) from fiscal year 2014 to $115.3 million for the year ended June 2, 2015.\nThe decrease for the year ended June 2, 2015 is due to lower advertising costs ($17.7 million) primarily as a result of decreased television advertising, and a reduction in general and administrative costs ($4.1 million) due to lower management labor from reductions in staffing, a decrease in consulting fees, and lower legal fees. The decrease in overall television advertising is attributable to management's desire to spend marketing dollars more efficiently, with an increased focus on supporting our national cable television advertising with print and electronic promotions. These were partially offset by higher accruals for support center bonus.\nClosures and Impairments, Net\nClosures and impairments, net increased $52.1 million to $62.7 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The $52.1 million increase is primarily due to higher property impairment charges ($48.3 million), closed restaurant lease reserve expense ($2.6 million), and other closing costs ($0.3 million), coupled with lower gains on the sale of surplus properties ($0.9 million).\nThe increase in closures and impairments for the year ended May 31, 2016 is primarily due to higher Ruby Tuesday concept property impairment charges coupled with $6.4 million of impairments, lease reserves, severance, and other charges associated with the closure of 11 Lime Fresh restaurants during the current fiscal year. As further discussed in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of the Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016. Given the status of the plan as of May 31, 2016, we concluded that there was an impairment trigger as certain restaurants would be disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $39.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 related to\nthese restaurants. Also included within Closures and impairments, net for fiscal year 2016 are impairments of $14.7 million related to open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants with deteriorating operational performance during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016 or not included within management's developing closure plan during the fourth fiscal quarter, $3.4 million related to Lime Fresh Mexican Grill concept restaurants, and $0.8 million related to surplus properties.\nClosures and impairments, net decreased $22.3 million to $10.5 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower property impairment charges ($14.5 million), closed restaurant lease reserve expense ($5.8 million), and other closing costs ($1.2 million) coupled with higher gains on the sale of surplus properties ($0.7 million).\nThe decrease in closures and impairments for the year ended June 2, 2015 is primarily due to lower property impairment charges as the same periods of the prior fiscal year included, among other charges, larger impairments attributable to open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants experiencing deteriorating operational performance and related to early restaurant closures. Fiscal year 2014 charges were also higher due to a plan to close approximately 30 Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants by the end of that fiscal year.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014. Further information regarding closures and impairments expense for the Ruby Tuesday and Lime Fresh concepts for all periods presented is contained in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTrademark Impairments\nAs previously discussed within this MD&A, during fiscal year 2016 we entered into an agreement to sell eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. In connection with these events, we concluded that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million representing a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we concluded that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired by using entity specific projections for undiscounted cash flows that incorporated only those Lime Fresh assets existing as of the measurement date. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $0.9 million representing a partial impairment of the Lime Fresh trademark.\nAs further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As a result of this transaction, our Lime Fresh trademark had no net book value remaining at May 31, 2016. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our trademark impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2016 and 2014.\nGain on Sales of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill Assets\nAs previously discussed within this MD&A and further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to eight Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants in Florida for $6.0 million and closed the remaining 11 Company-owned Lime Fresh restaurants. Six of the restaurants were closed and transferred to the buyer during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, after which we were paid $5.0 million. One of the remaining two restaurants closed and transferred to the buyer shortly after our fiscal year-end, and the other restaurant is expected to close and transfer to the buyer on or before the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The remaining $1.0 million of consideration will be received when the remaining restaurant has transferred to the buyer. We recognized during fiscal year 2016 a gain of $3.1 million on this transaction. All of the eight restaurants involved in this transaction will be rebranded by the buyer as a different restaurant concept.\nAlso during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we sold the Lime Fresh brand's intellectual property and the franchise agreements associated with eight franchised Lime Fresh concept restaurants for $4.6 million. We recognized a gain of $2.8 million on this transaction.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.0 million to $21.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest resulting from the early payoff of certain mortgage loans and repurchases of our Senior Notes since the prior fiscal year. Partially offsetting these decreases were $0.6 million in increased prepayment premiums paid in connection with mortgage obligations that we prepaid and retired in fiscal year 2016 above those paid in the previous fiscal year.\nInterest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $22.7 million for the year ended June 2, 2015, primarily due to lower interest expense on our Senior Notes due to repurchases during fiscal year 2014 and the early payoff of certain mortgage loans since fiscal year 2014.\n(Gain)/Loss on Extinguishment of Debt\nUnder the terms of the Senior Credit Facility we are allowed, under certain circumstances, to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Senior Notes in any fiscal year. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $1.4 million for the year ended June 3, 2014 due to our repurchase of $20.0 million of the Senior Notes for $20.0 million plus $0.2 million of accrued interest. We realized losses of $0.7 million on these transactions. Additionally, we incurred a $0.7 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 relating to the write-off of the pro rata portion of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the previous credit facility.\nBenefit for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations\nWe recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $2.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, compared to a tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015. Included in our $1.9 million tax benefit for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015 was a benefit of $3.2 million recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, representing an immaterial prior period correction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2015, compared to a tax benefit from continuing operations of $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 3, 2014. Included in our $1.9 million tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended June 2, 2015 was the previously mentioned benefit of $3.2 million, with the remaining $1.3 million in net expense is attributable to decreased pre-tax losses and changes in uncertain tax reserves for fiscal year 2015.\nWe regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the deferred tax assets in the future. A valuation allowance assessment is performed each reporting period, with any additions or adjustments reflected in earnings in the period of assessment. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction.\nOur valuation allowance for deferred tax assets totaled $89.9 million and $62.8 million as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively. Included within our income tax benefit from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of $28.2 million, $9.1 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, representing the amount reserved for the increase in net deferred tax assets during the periods (primarily related to general business credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards). Additionally, a valuation allowance benefit of $0.3 million was included within the income tax benefit from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014.\nUnder ASC 740, we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. As a result of, among other charges, closures and impairments and trademark impairment charges, we currently reflect a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss. A cumulative pre-tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income, and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome. Before consideration of the valuation\nallowance expense, we had an income tax benefit of $30.4 million, $11.0 million, and $35.9 million, including the tax credits, in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn an effort to focus primarily on the sales turnaround of our core Ruby Tuesday concept and secondly, to improve the financial performance of our then Lime Fresh concept, we completed the closure of our Marlin & Ray's, Wok Hay, and Truffles restaurants during fiscal year 2013. We have classified the results of operations of our Company-owned Marlin & Ray's, Wok Hay, and Truffles concepts as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended June 3, 2014. The results of operations of our discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in thousands).\n\nOperating Activities\nOur cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees. Substantially all of the $1,085.0 million, $1,120.1 million, and $1,162.4 million of restaurant sales and operating revenue disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, was received in cash either at the point of sale or within two to four days (when our customers paid with debit or credit cards). Our primary uses of cash for operating activities are food and beverage purchases, payroll and benefit costs, restaurant operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and marketing, a significant portion of which are incurred and paid in the same period.\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 decreased $14.8 million (27.0%) from the prior fiscal year to $40.1 million. The decrease is primarily the result of lower Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), increases in amounts spent to acquire inventory, decreases in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities due to the timing of payments, and an increase in cash paid for taxes ($2.8 million). These were partially offset by lower cash paid for interest ($1.0 million) due to the prepayment of certain of our mortgage obligations and other principal payments on our debt since the prior fiscal year and a decrease in amounts spent on media advertising (approximately $1.7 million).\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 increased $9.5 million (21.0%) from fiscal year 2014 to $54.9 million. The increase is primarily the result of higher EBITDA due in part to restaurant-level cost improvements and reductions in amounts spent on media advertising. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities due to the timing of payments (approximately $11.4 million) and inventory (approximately $8.9 million) as amounts for fiscal year 2014 related to levels of lobster held in inventory that were significantly lower than those of the preceding year.\nOur working capital and current ratio as of May 31, 2016 were $23.2 million and 1.2:1, respectively. While we typically carry current liabilities in excess of current assets as is common in the restaurant industry, we have reduced our accounts payable and other accrued liabilities since the prior fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nWe require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants, limited new restaurant construction, investments in technology, equipment, remodeling of existing restaurants, and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts. Property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, and/or proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $34.4 million, $31.0 million, and $28.3 million, respectively. In addition, proceeds from the disposal of assets produced $11.7 million, $11.3 million, and $15.5 million of cash in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, following actions taken to more aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt and, for fiscal year 2016, to substantially exit the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 3, 2014, we completed sale-leaseback transactions of the land and building for three Company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants for gross cash proceeds of $5.9 million, exclusive of transaction costs of approximately $0.3 million. Equipment was not included. The net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions were used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, debt payments, and, in fiscal years prior to 2014, the repurchase of shares of our common stock. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are estimated to be in the range of between $38.0 million to $42.0 million. We intend to fund our investing activities with cash currently on hand, cash provided by operations, proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, or borrowings on the Senior Credit Facility.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities, coupled with sale-leaseback transactions and sales of surplus properties. When these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs, we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock.\nOur current borrowings and credit facilities include $212.5 million outstanding principal of 7.625% senior notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes\u201d), a four year revolving credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility\u201d) under which we may borrow up to $50.0 million, and $15.7 million of mortgage loan obligations acquired upon franchise acquisitions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for key terms and further information on our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and mortgage loan obligations.\nUnder the terms of the Senior Credit Facility we are allowed, under certain circumstances, to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Senior Notes in any fiscal year. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions. We did not repurchase any Senior Notes during the year ended June 2, 2015. During the year ended June 3, 2014, we repurchased $20.0 million of the Senior Notes for $20.0 million plus $0.2 million of accrued interest. We realized losses of $0.7 million on these transactions.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we prepaid and retired 16 mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $13.3 million using cash on hand. We paid $1.6 million in prepayment premiums and $0.1 million of accrued interest in connection with the retirement of these obligations. The prepayment of this debt eliminated one mortgage lender and allowed for the release of 44 properties which had served as collateral. Additionally, during fiscal year 2015, we prepaid and retired ten mortgage loan obligations with an aggregate balance of $9.0 million using cash on hand. In connection with the retirement of these obligations, we paid $1.0 million in prepayment premiums and an insignificant amount of accrued interest.\nDuring fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we repurchased 1.9 million, an insignificant number, and 0.1 million shares of RTI common stock, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2016, the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased was 9.9 million. Additionally, there were no dividends paid during fiscal years 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nSignificant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nLong-term financial obligations were as follows as of May 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n (a) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt. \n (b) Amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed-rate debt instruments. Additionally, the amounts shown above include interest payments on the Senior Notes at the current interest rate of 7.625%. \n (c) This amount includes lease payments for certain optional renewal periods for which exercise is considered reasonably assured as well as operating leases totaling $4.3 million for which sublease income from franchisees or others is expected. Certain of these leases obligate us to pay maintenance costs, utilities, real estate taxes, and insurance, which are excluded from the amounts shown above. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n (d) The amounts for purchase obligations include cash commitments under contract for food items and supplies, advertising, utility contracts, and other miscellaneous commitments. \n (e) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n (f) This amount excludes $4.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. \nCommercial commitments were as follows as of May 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nAt May 31, 2016, we had divestiture guarantees, which arose in fiscal 1996, when our shareholders approved the distribution of our family dining restaurant business (Morrison Fresh Cooking, Inc., MFC\u201d) and our health care food and nutrition services business (Morrison Health Care, Inc., MHC\u201d). Subsequent to that date Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc. ( Piccadilly\u201d) acquired MFC and Compass Group ( Compass\u201d) acquired MHC. As agreed upon at the time of the distribution, we have been contingently liable for payments to MFC and MHC employees retiring under MFC's and MHC's versions of the Management Retirement Plan and the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan (the two non-qualified defined benefit plans) for the accrued benefits earned by those participants as of March 1996.\nWe estimated our divestiture guarantees at May 31, 2016 to be $6.8 million for employee benefit plans (all of which resides with MHC following Piccadilly's bankruptcy in fiscal 2004). We believe the likelihood of being required to make payments for MHC's portion to be remote due to the size and financial strength of MHC and Compass.\nAs of May 31, 2016, we are the guarantor of nine third-party leases associated with closed concept restaurants. Lease guarantee amounts in the table above represent lease payments for which we are contingently liable. While we believe that the likelihood of being required to make these lease payments is remote, we recorded a guarantee liability of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our operating leases.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding accounting pronouncements not yet adopted is incorporated by reference from Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur MD&A is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we consider the forecasted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the restaurant, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Fair value is market participant-based upon broker estimates of the value of land, building, leasehold improvements, and other residual assets, or estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value.\nUnder our policies, recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment. If a restaurant that has been open for at least six full quarters shows negative cash flow results, we evaluate the plan to reverse the negative performance. Both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments. We also perform tests for impairment of intangible assets when other events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired.\nAs discussed in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in response to a comprehensive review by management of our property portfolio, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested a significant number of open Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants for impairment as we concluded it was more likely than not they would close significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life. We evaluated recoverability based on the restaurants forecasted undiscounted cash flows for 107 restaurants, which incorporated probability weighted scenarios of either remaining open or closing in the near term. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the probability weighted scenarios changing by 10% and the results were not materially different. For restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we wrote those assets down to estimated fair value. As a result of this analysis, the Company incurred $39.2 million of impairment charges during fiscal year 2016. We also tested the Lime Fresh trademark for impairment during fiscal years 2016 and 2014 as factors were present which indicated the trademark may be impaired. We determined that the Lime Fresh trademark was partially impaired and recorded charges of $2.0 million and $0.9 million during fiscal years 2016 and 2014, respectively.\nAt May 31, 2016, we had 75 restaurants that had been open for more than six full quarters with rolling 12-month negative cash flows of which 67 are expected to close by September 2016 either as part of the asset rationalization plan as previously discussed or as leases expire. Of the eight restaurants which remained, we recorded impairments for five properties based on their estimated values and we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at the remaining\nthree properties and determined that no impairments were necessary. The remaining net book value of the eight restaurants was $2.2 million at May 31, 2016.\nShould cash flows at these cash flow negative restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time, further impairment charges may occur. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, including cash flows from continuing use, terminal value, closure costs, salvage value, and sublease income. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from our estimates.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Accruals\nWe record deferred tax assets for various items and a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets when current available information raises doubt as to their ultimate realization. Despite the existence of long carryforward periods for some of our largest deferred tax assets, such as unused employment tax credits and federal and/or state net operating losses, and a history of realizing our deferred tax assets by utilizing those credits and losses in subsequent or carryback years, a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss is an example of negative evidence that raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets. To determine the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, we schedule a year-by-year estimation of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in order to determine the availability of future taxable income which would allow for the realization of our existing deferred tax assets. While we are able to incorporate tax planning strategies into our analysis, we do not factor projected future income until such time that the positive evidence supporting realization outweighs the negative evidence (most significantly, the three-year cumulative pre-tax loss).\nWe recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $89.9 million and $62.8 million as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015, respectively. Included within our income tax benefit from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of $28.2 million, $9.1 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Additionally, a valuation allowance benefit of $0.3 million was included in income tax benefit from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014. Given that we last recorded pre-tax income in fiscal 2011, we will likely not be able to reverse the significant valuation allowance recorded in the near future. Our recorded valuation allowance may be subject to material changes in the future, as our ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Upon such time that we are able to reverse the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, income tax expense will be reduced, and net income will correspondingly be increased, by the amount we are able to reverse.\nLease Obligations\nWe lease a significant number of our restaurant properties. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease. The term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. The primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with our investment into leasehold improvements which might become impaired should we choose not to continue the use of the leased property.\nOur operating lease term used for straight-line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the end of the lease term. There is potential for variability in our rent holiday\u201d period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments. Factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction-related delays. Extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period.\nFor operating leases that contain predetermined fixed rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as determined above, on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday\u201d period beginning upon possession of the premises), and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments, called \"contingent rents,\" when the associated restaurants' sales volumes exceed agreed-upon levels. We recognize contingent rental expense (in annual as well as interim periods) prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense, provided that achievement of that target is considered probable.\nThe judgment regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease impacts the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday and/or escalation in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant amortized. The material factor we consider when making this judgment is the total amount invested in the restaurant at the inception of the lease and whether management believes that renewal appears reasonably assured. While a different term may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization, and rent expense than reported, our historical lease renewal rates support the judgments made. We have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for leases in any of the fiscal years presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe record the estimated future lease obligations on leased restaurants upon closure for which we have not sublet or settled the lease with the respective landlord as of a quarter end date. Inherent in these estimates is an assumption on the time period we anticipate it will take to reach a settlement with our landlord or to execute on a sublease agreement. We calculate the lease obligation as the present value of future minimum net lease or settlement payments using a discount rate that takes into account the remaining time period prior to the estimated date of resolution. As further discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our estimated lease obligations for closed restaurants as of May 31, 2016 and June 2, 2015 were $6.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively.\nEstimated Liability for Self-Insurance\nWe self-insure a portion of our expected losses under our employee health care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability, and property insurance programs. Specifically with our workers' compensation and general liability coverages, we have stop loss insurance for individual claims in excess of stated loss amounts. Insurance liabilities are recorded based on third-party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses, net of payments made. The estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the Company and supplemental information as appropriate.\nThe analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including, but not limited to, (a) the quality of historical loss and exposure information, (b) the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience, (c) the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the Company, and (d) projected payrolls and revenue. As claims develop, the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates. Therefore, an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required.\nKnown Events, Uncertainties, and Trends\nUpcoming Restaurant Closures\nAs discussed previously within this MD&A and discussed further in Notes 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 11, 2016, following a comprehensive review of our Company's property portfolio, we announced a plan to close approximately 95 Company-owned restaurants by September 2016. The approved closures, which include mall, in line, and freestanding sites, encompass restaurants spread throughout all of the geographies in which the Company operates. Of the restaurants expected to close, approximately two-thirds are operated on leased properties and approximately one-third are owned.\nWe incurred $39.2 million of impairment charges in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2016 following an impairment analysis performed for the restaurants deemed, as of May 31, 2016, to be more than likely to be closed significantly prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives based on the then status of management's developing plan. In addition to the impairment charges recorded during fiscal year 2016, further impairment charges will be incurred based on changes ultimately made to the plan after May 31, 2016 and as the restaurants actually close. Accordingly, the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017 closures and impairments are expected to include additional impairment charges of approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million for restaurants added to management's plan subsequent to May 31, 2016, approximately $19.0 million to $21.0 million associated with estimated lease settlement costs and approximately $11.0 million to $16.0 million in severance benefits, inventory write-off and other costs. The actual amount of any cash payments made by the Company for lease contract termination costs will be dependent upon ongoing negotiations with the landlords of the leased restaurant properties and could be higher or lower than the amounts currently estimated.\nFinancial Strategy and Stock Repurchase Plan\nCash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2016 were $67.3 million. Our overall goal is to invest in our brand and to strengthen our balance sheet to improve credit metrics. As such, our first priority is to ensure that we have adequate cash levels to run the business and internally fund our capital expenditures. Our second priority is to reduce our outstanding debt to help improve our credit metrics with the goal of improved flexibility and access to capital at reasonable rates. Lastly, we would consider share repurchases within the limitations of our debt covenants to return capital to shareholders. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.1 million. As of May 31, 2016, the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased was 9.9 million. Any of these actions, in any particular period and the actual amount thereof, remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that any such actions will be taken in the future.\nRepurchases of Senior Notes\nWe are allowed under the terms of the Senior Credit Facility to repurchase, in any fiscal year, up to $20.0 million of indebtedness to various holders of the Senior Notes. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we repurchased $2.5 million of the Senior Notes for $2.4 million plus accrued interest. We realized a negligible gain on these transactions. As of the date of this filing, we may repurchase $20.0 million of the Senior Notes during the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Future repurchases of the Senior Notes, if any, will be funded with available cash on hand.\nDividends\nDuring fiscal 1997, our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders. No dividends were declared or paid during the three year period ended May 31, 2016. The payment of a dividend in any particular period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year 2017 will contain 53 weeks and end on June 6, 2017.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation on the cost of food, labor, supplies, utilities, real estate, and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results. Historically, we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements. Competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases. Historically, the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income.", "item_7_tables": "Table 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td>

concept. As of May 31, 2016, it owned 646 restaurants and franchised 78 restaurants.\n\n- In FY2016, same-restaurant sales declined 1.4% for company-owned restaurants due to lower customer traffic, offset partly by higher check averages. \n\n- Ruby Tuesday formulated a plan in Q4 FY2016 to close ~95 underperforming company-owned restaurants by September 2016, resulting in $39.2 million of impairment charges in FY2016.\n\n- The company also sold assets of 8 Lime Fresh restaurants for $6M and closed 11 other Lime Fresh restaurants in FY2016. Additionally, it sold Lime Fresh intellectual property and franchise agreements for $4.6M.\n\n- Pre-tax loss from continuing operations was $52.9 million in FY2016 compared to $5.1 million in FY2015, primarily due to higher impairment charges, lower same-restaurant sales, and increased costs of goods sold and payroll.\n\n- Cash provided by operations was $40.1 million in FY2016, down from $54.9 million in FY2015, mainly due to lower EBITDA, higher inventory purchases, and timing of payments. \n\n- Capital expenditures were $34.4 million in FY2016. Cash priorities are investing in the brand, reducing debt, and potential share repurchases.\n\n- Upcoming plans include closing ~95 underperforming restaurants in FY2017, which is estimated to result in $3-5M of additional impairment charges and $19-21M of lease settlement costs."}
