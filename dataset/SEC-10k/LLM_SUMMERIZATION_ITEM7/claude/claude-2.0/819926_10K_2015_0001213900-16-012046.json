In our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our customers already upgraded to newer models last year and much of our remaining customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. Our forged rolled rings and related products segment in particular experienced a significant reduction in sales and operated at a loss during 2015.\nWe began to deliver parts and equipment in our petroleum and chemical equipment segment in 2015, which helped offset the decreases in revenue from our other two segments. In December 2015, we received a letter from this customer, pursuant to which the customer claimed that we were in breach of agreement because we were delinquent in the delivery of the products and those products that were delivered did not meet the required quality standards. The customer claimed that it is entitled to damages of RMB 36,103,640, or approximately $5,806,778 at December 31, 2015. As a result of the dispute with this customer, the Company, at December 31, 2015:\nTable 44: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Recognized a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,806,778, which is reflected as an operating expense relating to the liability claimed by the customer in its letter; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased our accounts receivable reserve to fully reserve the approximately $1,759,000 due from this customer; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $836,000, representing the remaining inventory manufactured to the specifications of this customer; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 relating to the manufacturing equipment which is specially designed to manufacture products for petroleum and chemical customer and is not otherwise used by the Company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are engaged in discussions with this customer, but cannot predict the results of these discussions. We are also evaluating our ability to continue in the petroleum and chemical segment, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to operate in this segment or that we will not suffer an impairment charge in 2016.\nWe conducted an impairment assessment to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2015 and 2014 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these segments. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment and equipment held for sale, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $7,000.000 and $3,800,000 in December 2015 and 2014, respectively. The charge for 2015 reflected impairment charges of approximately $5,100,000 relating to the forged rolled rings and related products segment, of which approximately $400,000 related to the equipment held for sale, and approximately $1,900,000 relating to the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, as described above. All of the impairment charges for 2014 related to the equipment held for sale.\nThe factors that affected our revenue, gross margin and net income in our segments during the year ended December 31, 2015, including the factors which resulted in significant declines in revenues in both our dyeing and finishing equipment segment and our forged rolled rings and related components segments, which are described below, are likely to continue to affect our operations in the near future. Our ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government's policy on such matters as the availability of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to alternative energy such as wind power, which affect our products for these industries. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues in any segment in the near future, if at all. Because of the nature of our products, our customers' projection of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date.\nDyeing and Finishing Equipment Segment\nRevenues from our dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased $13.2 million, or 31.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and in 2015, dyeing and finishing equipment segment revenues accounted for 58.5% of our total revenues. In order to reduce our business risk, we tightened our credit review policies in 2015.\nAdditionally, we experienced a slowdown in shipments of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already replaced older dyeing equipment with new equipment, and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines slowed down in 2015.\nWe expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or near the current yearly level for the near future.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForged Rolled Rings and Related Components Segment\nThrough our forged rolled rings and other related components division, we produce precision forged rolled rings and other forged components to the wind power and other industries. Our forged rolled rings and other related components are sold to manufacturers of industrial equipment. Forged rolled rings and other forged components for the wind industry are used in wind turbines, which are used to generate wind power.\nRevenues from our forged rolled rings and related components segment decreased $21.7 million, or 64.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, including wind power industry and other industries, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term, other factors, such as economic factors and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements of our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenue and net income will be affected. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation for forged rolled rings and related components for wind power and other industries and this market saturation, combined with the effects of lower oil and gas prices, has reduced the demand for construction of wind power facilities, and we expect that our revenues from forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease in the near future.\nWe believe that wind power will see its share of China's national energy mix gradually increase. While interest in wind power is increasing in many countries, we do not have the infrastructure and personnel to market our products in countries other than China, and we are continuing to limit our sales and marketing efforts to China to wind power and other industries customers.\nWe are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report. If we discontinue this segment, we anticipate that we may incur further impairment charges with respect to assets used in this segment.\nPetroleum and Chemical Equipment Segment\nThrough our petroleum and chemical equipment division, we produce and sell equipment such as coal chemical equipment, formaldehyde plant and downstream products, reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers to petroleum and chemical industries. We started to sell our petroleum and chemical equipment in February 2015. Revenue from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The market for petroleum products is mainly dominated by three major Chinese petroleum companies, and their capital expenditure and purchasing policy will have a significant effect both upon our ability to generate revenue from this segment and the gross margins which we can generate. Furthermore, because we sell our petroleum and chemical equipment products to a very small number of customers, the change in the purchasing policies of one or two customers could have a significant effect on our revenues from this segment. Sales to a large state-owned enterprise for parts and equipment to be used on a major chemical project in Xinjiang, which was generated in the year ended December 31, 2015, accounted for approximately $6.2 million, or 73.4% of the petroleum and chemical equipment segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs discussed above, in December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer in this segment, which was our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13% or our consolidated revenues for 2015, alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Pursuant to the sales contract, this customer demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB. In connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,806,778 which has been reflected as a loss from sale contract dispute in operating expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss and has been reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2015. Additionally, in December 2015, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer's full amount of outstanding accounts receivable. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected. Also, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of such customer and not readily saleable to other customers, and we incurred an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 for equipment used for this customer's products which did not have other uses.\nWe expect that our revenues from petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report. Any discontinuation of this segment may result in further impairment charges relating to the assets associated with this segment.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nA major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to price fluctuations, and recently these fluctuations have been significant. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also can impair our margins. Three major suppliers provided approximately 47% and 49% of our purchases of inventories for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other supplier accounted for 10% or more of our purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nPursuant to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nThe Huayang Companies are considered VIEs, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with the Huayang Companies pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of the Huayang Companies' net income. In accordance with these agreements, the Huayang Companies shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service the Huayang Companies.\nThe accounts of the Huayang Companies are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As VIEs, the Huayang Companies sales are included in our total sales, their income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of the Huayang Companies' net income, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in the Huayang Companies that require consolidation of the Huayang Companies financial statements with our financial statements.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nWe have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAs a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the weighted average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing and delivery.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Useful Life </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Building and building improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 20 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufacturing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 10 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office equipment and furniture </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the year of disposition.\nIncluded in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consists of factories and office buildings under construction and machinery pending installation and includes the costs of construction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLand Use Rights\nThere is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized on the straight-line method over the land use right terms.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and other components, petroleum and chemical equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally is recognized over the contract period. For 2015 and 2014, amounts allocated to installation and warranty revenues were minimal. Based on historical experience, warranty service calls and any related labor costs have been minimal.\nRental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease and is presented net of depreciation.\nAll other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions, including the forged rolled rings, are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are governed by the income tax laws of the PRC and the United States. Income taxes are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The charge for taxes is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is changed to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award. The Accounting Standards Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date.\u201d The expense is recognized over the period of services or the vesting period, whichever is applicable. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We record compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.\nCurrency Exchange Rates\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and VIEs is the RMB. All of our sales are denominated in RMB. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and RMB affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses.\nOur exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between signing of sales contracts and settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into RMB, the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of shareholders' equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.\nOur financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our parent company. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates is RMB. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of RMB against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-10, Technical Corrections and Improvements\u201d ( ASU 2015-10\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-10 cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-10 represent changes to clarify the ASC, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the ASC that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Additionally, some of the amendments will make the ASC easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving the presentation of guidance in the ASC. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in ASU 2015-10. The amendments in ASU 2015-10 that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the issuance of ASU 2015-10. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). The amendments in this update require an entity to measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 (the amendments in ASU 2015-11 do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is uncharged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d). ASU 2015-11 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had revenues of $49,566,000, as compared to revenues of $75,959,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $26,393,000 or 34.7%. The decrease in revenues for 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in revenue from both our forged rolled rings and related components segment and our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, partially offset by revenues generated from petroleum and chemical equipment segment. The change in revenues is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dyeing and finishing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,198 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Forged rolled rings and related components </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Petroleum and chemical equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NA </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,393 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDyeing and finishing equipment segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment decreased by approximately $13,198,000 or 31.3% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In order to reduce our business risk, we tightened our credit review policies in 2015. Additionally, we experienced an anticipated slowdown in shipments of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many customers had replaced older dyeing equipment with our low-emission airflow dyeing machine in 2014, and we believe that orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines have slowed down in 2015 because the remaining potential customer base included more companies that did not have the ability to make the significant capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their equipment. Accordingly, our revenues from dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nForged rolled rings and related products segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from the sale of forged rolled rings and related components decreased by approximately $21,669,000, or 64.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term other factors, such as economic factors and the fluctuations in the price of oil and coal and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements by our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenues and net income will be affected. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation, and we expect that our revenues from customers of forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease for the near future.\nPetroleum and chemical equipment segment\nWe sought to expand our business to oil and natural gas industries since 2013. We received the certifications needed to serve these markets in mid-2013. However, we did not generate revenues or incur manufacturing costs from the petroleum and chemical segment until the first quarter of 2015. Our revenue in this segment is highly dependent upon sales to the three major Chinese petrochemical companies, whose purchasing policies affect both our revenue and gross margin for this segment, one of which accounted for 73.4% of revenue from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Accordingly, we do not expect any further revenues from this customer and expect that our revenues from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes the cost of raw materials, labor, depreciation and other overhead costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenues was $42,216,000 as compared to $58,218,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $16,002,000, or 27.5%. Cost of revenues for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was $22,514,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $32,450,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues related to the manufacture of forged rolled rings and related components was $12,512,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $25,768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues for the petroleum and chemical equipment was $7,190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Since the manufacture and sale of the petroleum and chemical products commenced in the first quarter of 2015, we had neither revenues nor cost of revenues from this segment in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit was $7,350,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $17,741,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of 14.8% and 23.4%, respectively.\n.\nGross profit for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was $6,497,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $9,759,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of approximately 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, a slight decrease year over year. We expect that our gross margin from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at its current levels.\nWe incurred a negative gross profit from forged rolled rings and related components segment of $431,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to gross profit of $7,982,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of approximately (3.6)% and 23.6%, respectively. The significant decrease in our gross margin for the forged rolled rings and related components segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributed to the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, combined with a modest increase in labor costs.\nAt December 31, 2015, we conducted an impairment assessment on property and equipment in our forged rolled rings and related components segment to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in the Company's forged rolled rings and related components segment and reduced the net book value of this equipment as discussed below. In 2016, we expect depreciation to be lower due to the reduction of net book value reflecting the impairment of equipment in the petroleum and chemical equipment and forged rolled rings and related products segments. We expect that our gross margin from forged rolled rings and related components segment will continue to be low in 2016 because we are not optimistic about the market for forged rolled rings and related products. We are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report.\nGross profit for the petroleum and chemical equipment segment was $1,284,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing gross margin of approximately 15.2% and was effected by an increase in our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000. As a result of the December 2015 notice of breach of contract, described above, from our largest customer, which was a customer in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of such customer, which are not readily saleable to other customers. Many companies bid for the petroleum and chemical equipment orders. Since we are a small company and just entered this market in February 2015 and our customer base is small, we have offered a lower price in order to generate orders. Therefore, our gross margin for petroleum and chemical equipment is low. The low gross margin in this segment was one of factors in overall reduced gross margins, along with the negative gross margin from the forged rolled rings and related components in 2015. Due to the loss of our largest customer in this segment, we are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report.\nOperating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses were $18,595,000 as compared to $8,831,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $9,764,000, or 110.6%, and consisted of the following:\n.\nDepreciation. Depreciation was $8,129,000 and $8,470,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was included in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental income, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe depreciation expense for cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 remained roughly consistent as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe increase in depreciation expense for operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was mainly attributable to the increase in depreciation related to newly purchased office equipment and furniture and from office and dormitory buildings and other improvements which we started depreciating in the second half of 2014.\nThe depreciation expense for other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was related to the equipment then held for operating lease during 2014 and was reflected as an offset against rental income.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,782,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3,672,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $890,000 or 24.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Payroll and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>993 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Travel and entertainment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Shipping </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>485 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $54,000, or 15.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded bad debt expense of $2,062,000 and $522,000, respectively. Based on our periodic review of accounts receivable balances, we adjusted the allowance for doubtful accounts after considering management's evaluation of the collectability of individual receivable balances, including the analysis of subsequent collections, the customers' collection history, the write off of uncollectible receivables against the existing reserve, and recent economic events. In December 2015, based on a notice of contract breach from our largest petroleum and chemical equipment segment customer, as described above, the customer requested some relief and has not paid the remaining outstanding accounts receivable balance of approximately $1,759,000. Accordingly, in addition to general changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer's full amount of outstanding accounts receivable. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $99,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $17,000, or 14.9%. Research and development expenses related to the development of new dyeing and finishing products.\nImpairment loss. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment losses of $7,017,000 and $3,800,000, respectively, consisting of the following:\nTable 66: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment losses of approximately $417,000 and $3,800,000, respectively, on ESR equipment.

Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2015 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these segments. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6,600,000 at December 31, 2015. We did not record any impairment charge on the property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on sales contract dispute. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects, as described above. This customer demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB which was reflect as a liability at December 31, 2015. In connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,807,000 which has been reflected in operating expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n(Loss) income from operations. As a result of the factors described above, for the year ended December 31, 2015, loss from operations amounted to $(11,246,000), as compared to income from operations of $8,910,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) includes interest income, interest expense, grant income, foreign currency transaction gain/(loss), rental income, net, and other income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total other expense, net, amounted to $180,000 as compared to $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $97,000. The increase in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to a decrease in grant income of approximately $35,000, and the decrease in rental income, net, of approximately $102,000, offset by the increase in interest income of approximately $22,000, and the increase in other income of approximately $16,000.\nGrant income for 2014 represents incentives granted and received from the Chinese government to encourage technology innovation and related to the patents we received in 2014 for devices and parts of our airflow dyeing machine.\nRental income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2014, included rental income, net of related depreciation which was recognized as a reduction of rental income, from our equipment held for operating lease during 2014.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $1,345,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $4,561,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3,216,000, or 70.5%. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in taxable income generated by our operating entities in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Certain impairment losses are not treated as expenses under the tax laws of the PRC.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet (loss) income. As a result of the foregoing, our net loss was $12,770,000, or $(3.24) per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with net income $4,266,000, or $1.15 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2014, a change of $17,036,000, or 399.3%.\nForeign currency translation loss. The functional currency of our subsidiaries and variable interest entities operating in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi ( RMB\u201d). The financial statements of our subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange (for the period) for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation loss of $4,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a foreign currency translation loss of $408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This non-cash loss had the effect of increasing/decreasing our reported comprehensive loss/income.\nComprehensive (loss) income. As a result of our foreign currency translation loss, we had comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $17,539,000, compared to comprehensive income of $3,858,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash balances of approximately $18,790,000 and $7,836,000, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe are currently engaged in three business segments:\n \u25cf the dyeing and finishing equipment segment, in which we manufacture and sell textile dyeing and finishing machines; \n \u25cf the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufacture and sell high precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components; and \n \u25cf the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufacture and sell equipment, such as reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers and other components, to the petroleum and chemical industries. Sales in this segment commenced in the first quarter of 2015. We did not operate in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment during 2014. \nThe following table sets forth information as to revenues of our dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and related components, and petroleum and chemical equipment segments in dollars and as a percent of revenues (dollars in thousands):\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dyeing and finishing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Forged rolled rings and related components </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Petroleum and chemical equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 25 \nIn 2015, challenging economic conditions, falling steel prices and limited availability of credit in China and well as challenges in operating in a new segment - the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, presented numerous challenges for our business. In our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our customers already upgraded to newer models last year and much of our remaining customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. Our forged rolled rings and related products segment in particular experienced a significant reduction in sales and operated at a loss during 2015.\nWe began to deliver parts and equipment in our petroleum and chemical equipment segment in 2015, which helped offset the decreases in revenue from our other two segments. In December 2015, we received a letter from this customer, pursuant to which the customer claimed that we were in breach of agreement because we were delinquent in the delivery of the products and those products that were delivered did not meet the required quality standards. The customer claimed that it is entitled to damages of RMB 36,103,640, or approximately $5,806,778 at December 31, 2015. As a result of the dispute with this customer, the Company, at December 31, 2015:\n \u25cf Recognized a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,806,778, which is reflected as an operating expense relating to the liability claimed by the customer in its letter; \u25cf Increased our accounts receivable reserve to fully reserve the approximately $1,759,000 due from this customer; \u25cf Increased our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $836,000, representing the remaining inventory manufactured to the specifications of this customer; and \u25cf Recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 relating to the manufacturing equipment which is specially designed to manufacture products for petroleum and chemical customer and is not otherwise used by the Company. \nWe are engaged in discussions with this customer, but cannot predict the results of these discussions. We are also evaluating our ability to continue in the petroleum and chemical segment, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to operate in this segment or that we will not suffer an impairment charge in 2016.\nWe conducted an impairment assessment to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2015 and 2014 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these segments. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment and equipment held for sale, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $7,000.000 and $3,800,000 in December 2015 and 2014, respectively. The charge for 2015 reflected impairment charges of approximately $5,100,000 relating to the forged rolled rings and related products segment, of which approximately $400,000 related to the equipment held for sale, and approximately $1,900,000 relating to the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, as described above. All of the impairment charges for 2014 related to the equipment held for sale.\nThe factors that affected our revenue, gross margin and net income in our segments during the year ended December 31, 2015, including the factors which resulted in significant declines in revenues in both our dyeing and finishing equipment segment and our forged rolled rings and related components segments, which are described below, are likely to continue to affect our operations in the near future. Our ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government's policy on such matters as the availability of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to alternative energy such as wind power, which affect our products for these industries. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues in any segment in the near future, if at all. Because of the nature of our products, our customers' projection of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date.\nDyeing and Finishing Equipment Segment\nRevenues from our dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased $13.2 million, or 31.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and in 2015, dyeing and finishing equipment segment revenues accounted for 58.5% of our total revenues. In order to reduce our business risk, we tightened our credit review policies in 2015.\nAdditionally, we experienced a slowdown in shipments of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already replaced older dyeing equipment with new equipment, and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines slowed down in 2015.\nWe expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or near the current yearly level for the near future.\n 26 \nForged Rolled Rings and Related Components Segment\nThrough our forged rolled rings and other related components division, we produce precision forged rolled rings and other forged components to the wind power and other industries. Our forged rolled rings and other related components are sold to manufacturers of industrial equipment. Forged rolled rings and other forged components for the wind industry are used in wind turbines, which are used to generate wind power.\nRevenues from our forged rolled rings and related components segment decreased $21.7 million, or 64.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, including wind power industry and other industries, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term, other factors, such as economic factors and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements of our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenue and net income will be affected. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation for forged rolled rings and related components for wind power and other industries and this market saturation, combined with the effects of lower oil and gas prices, has reduced the demand for construction of wind power facilities, and we expect that our revenues from forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease in the near future.\nWe believe that wind power will see its share of China's national energy mix gradually increase. While interest in wind power is increasing in many countries, we do not have the infrastructure and personnel to market our products in countries other than China, and we are continuing to limit our sales and marketing efforts to China to wind power and other industries customers.\nWe are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report. If we discontinue this segment, we anticipate that we may incur further impairment charges with respect to assets used in this segment.\nPetroleum and Chemical Equipment Segment\nThrough our petroleum and chemical equipment division, we produce and sell equipment such as coal chemical equipment, formaldehyde plant and downstream products, reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers to petroleum and chemical industries. We started to sell our petroleum and chemical equipment in February 2015. Revenue from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The market for petroleum products is mainly dominated by three major Chinese petroleum companies, and their capital expenditure and purchasing policy will have a significant effect both upon our ability to generate revenue from this segment and the gross margins which we can generate. Furthermore, because we sell our petroleum and chemical equipment products to a very small number of customers, the change in the purchasing policies of one or two customers could have a significant effect on our revenues from this segment. Sales to a large state-owned enterprise for parts and equipment to be used on a major chemical project in Xinjiang, which was generated in the year ended December 31, 2015, accounted for approximately $6.2 million, or 73.4% of the petroleum and chemical equipment segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs discussed above, in December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer in this segment, which was our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13% or our consolidated revenues for 2015, alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Pursuant to the sales contract, this customer demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB. In connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,806,778 which has been reflected as a loss from sale contract dispute in operating expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss and has been reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2015. Additionally, in December 2015, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer's full amount of outstanding accounts receivable. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected. Also, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of such customer and not readily saleable to other customers, and we incurred an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 for equipment used for this customer's products which did not have other uses.\nWe expect that our revenues from petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer.\n 27 \nWe are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report. Any discontinuation of this segment may result in further impairment charges relating to the assets associated with this segment.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nA major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to price fluctuations, and recently these fluctuations have been significant. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also can impair our margins. Three major suppliers provided approximately 47% and 49% of our purchases of inventories for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other supplier accounted for 10% or more of our purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nPursuant to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nThe Huayang Companies are considered VIEs, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with the Huayang Companies pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of the Huayang Companies' net income. In accordance with these agreements, the Huayang Companies shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service the Huayang Companies.\nThe accounts of the Huayang Companies are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As VIEs, the Huayang Companies sales are included in our total sales, their income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of the Huayang Companies' net income, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in the Huayang Companies that require consolidation of the Huayang Companies financial statements with our financial statements.\n 28 \nAccounts Receivable\nWe have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAs a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the weighted average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing and delivery.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Useful Life </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Building and building improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 20 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufacturing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 10 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office equipment and furniture </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the year of disposition.\nIncluded in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consists of factories and office buildings under construction and machinery pending installation and includes the costs of construction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\n 29 \nLand Use Rights\nThere is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized on the straight-line method over the land use right terms.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and other components, petroleum and chemical equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally is recognized over the contract period. For 2015 and 2014, amounts allocated to installation and warranty revenues were minimal. Based on historical experience, warranty service calls and any related labor costs have been minimal.\nRental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease and is presented net of depreciation.\nAll other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions, including the forged rolled rings, are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are governed by the income tax laws of the PRC and the United States. Income taxes are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The charge for taxes is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is changed to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award. The Accounting Standards Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\n 30 \nPursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date.\u201d The expense is recognized over the period of services or the vesting period, whichever is applicable. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We record compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.\nCurrency Exchange Rates\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and VIEs is the RMB. All of our sales are denominated in RMB. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and RMB affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses.\nOur exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between signing of sales contracts and settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into RMB, the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of shareholders' equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.\nOur financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our parent company. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates is RMB. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of RMB against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-10, Technical Corrections and Improvements\u201d ( ASU 2015-10\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-10 cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-10 represent changes to clarify the ASC, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the ASC that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Additionally, some of the amendments will make the ASC easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving the presentation of guidance in the ASC. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in ASU 2015-10. The amendments in ASU 2015-10 that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the issuance of ASU 2015-10. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). The amendments in this update require an entity to measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 (the amendments in ASU 2015-11 do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is uncharged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d). ASU 2015-11 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n 31 \nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth the results of our operations for the years

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had revenues of $49,566,000, as compared to revenues of $75,959,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $26,393,000 or 34.7%. The decrease in revenues for 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in revenue from both our forged rolled rings and related components segment and our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, partially offset by revenues generated from petroleum and chemical equipment segment. The change in revenues is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dyeing and finishing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,198 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Forged rolled rings and related components </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Petroleum and chemical equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NA </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,393 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDyeing and finishing equipment segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment decreased by approximately $13,198,000 or 31.3% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In order to reduce our business risk, we tightened our credit review policies in 2015. Additionally, we experienced an anticipated slowdown in shipments of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many customers had replaced older dyeing equipment with our low-emission airflow dyeing machine in 2014, and we believe that orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines have slowed down in 2015 because the remaining potential customer base included more companies that did not have the ability to make the significant capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their equipment. Accordingly, our revenues from dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nForged rolled rings and related products segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from the sale of forged rolled rings and related components decreased by approximately $21,669,000, or 64.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term other factors, such as economic factors and the fluctuations in the price of oil and coal and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements by our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenues and net income will be affected. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation, and we expect that our revenues from customers of forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease for the near future.\nPetroleum and chemical equipment segment\nWe sought to expand our business to oil and natural gas industries since 2013. We received the certifications needed to serve these markets in mid-2013. However, we did not generate revenues or incur manufacturing costs from the petroleum and chemical segment until the first quarter of 2015. Our revenue in this segment is highly dependent upon sales to the three major Chinese petrochemical companies, whose purchasing policies affect both our revenue and gross margin for this segment, one of which accounted for 73.4% of revenue from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Accordingly, we do not expect any further revenues from this customer and expect that our revenues from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes the cost of raw materials, labor, depreciation and other overhead costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenues was $42,216,000 as compared to $58,218,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $16,002,000, or 27.5%. Cost of revenues for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was $22,514,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $32,450,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues related to the manufacture of forged rolled rings and related components was $12,512,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $25,768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues for the petroleum and chemical equipment was $7,190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Since the manufacture and sale of the petroleum and chemical products commenced in the first quarter of 2015, we had neither revenues nor cost of revenues from this segment in the year ended December 31, 2014.\n 33 \nGross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit was $7,350,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $17,741,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of 14.8% and 23.4%, respectively.\n.\nGross profit for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was $6,497,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $9,759,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of approximately 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, a slight decrease year over year. We expect that our gross margin from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at its current levels.\nWe incurred a negative gross profit from forged rolled rings and related components segment of $431,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to gross profit of $7,982,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of approximately (3.6)% and 23.6%, respectively. The significant decrease in our gross margin for the forged rolled rings and related components segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributed to the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, combined with a modest increase in labor costs.\nAt December 31, 2015, we conducted an impairment assessment on property and equipment in our forged rolled rings and related components segment to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in the Company's forged rolled rings and related components segment and reduced the net book value of this equipment as discussed below. In 2016, we expect depreciation to be lower due to the reduction of net book value reflecting the impairment of equipment in the petroleum and chemical equipment and forged rolled rings and related products segments. We expect that our gross margin from forged rolled rings and related components segment will continue to be low in 2016 because we are not optimistic about the market for forged rolled rings and related products. We are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report.\nGross profit for the petroleum and chemical equipment segment was $1,284,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing gross margin of approximately 15.2% and was effected by an increase in our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000. As a result of the December 2015 notice of breach of contract, described above, from our largest customer, which was a customer in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of such customer, which are not readily saleable to other customers. Many companies bid for the petroleum and chemical equipment orders. Since we are a small company and just entered this market in February 2015 and our customer base is small, we have offered a lower price in order to generate orders. Therefore, our gross margin for petroleum and chemical equipment is low. The low gross margin in this segment was one of factors in overall reduced gross margins, along with the negative gross margin from the forged rolled rings and related components in 2015. Due to the loss of our largest customer in this segment, we are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report.\nOperating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses were $18,595,000 as compared to $8,831,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $9,764,000, or 110.6%, and consisted of the following:\n.\nDepreciation. Depreciation was $8,129,000 and $8,470,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was included in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental income, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 34 \nThe depreciation expense for cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 remained roughly consistent as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe increase in depreciation expense for operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was mainly attributable to the increase in depreciation related to newly purchased office equipment and furniture and from office and dormitory buildings and other improvements which we started depreciating in the second half of 2014.\nThe depreciation expense for other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was related to the equipment then held for operating lease during 2014 and was reflected as an offset against rental income.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,782,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3,672,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $890,000 or 24.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Payroll and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>993 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Travel and entertainment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Shipping </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>485 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $54,000, or 15.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investor relations service fees of approximately $11,000, and a decrease in inspection and testing fees for our dyeing and finishing equipment segment of approximately $31,000, and a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately $12,000. \n \u25cf Payroll and related benefits for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $172,000, or 17.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $90,000 which reflected the decrease in stock-based bonuses incurred and paid to our management in 2015, and a decrease in employee salaries and related benefits of approximately $82,000 due to the stricter control in general and administrative personnel. We expect that payroll and related benefits will remain in its current level with minimal increase in the near future. \n \u25cf Travel and entertainment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $148,000, or 31.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to stricter control on corporation expenditure. \n \u25cf Shipping expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $457,000, or 33.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was mainly attributable to the decrease in our revenues as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. \n \u25cf Other selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $59,000, or 12.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in vehicle expenses of approximately $18,000, a decrease in office supply of approximately $3,000, a decrease in miscellaneous taxes of approximately $11,000, and a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately $27,000. \nBad debt expense. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded bad debt expense of $2,062,000 and $522,000, respectively. Based on our periodic review of accounts receivable balances, we adjusted the allowance for doubtful accounts after considering management's evaluation of the collectability of individual receivable balances, including the analysis of subsequent collections, the customers' collection history, the write off of uncollectible receivables against the existing reserve, and recent economic events. In December 2015, based on a notice of contract breach from our largest petroleum and chemical equipment segment customer, as described above, the customer requested some relief and has not paid the remaining outstanding accounts receivable balance of approximately $1,759,000. Accordingly, in addition to general changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer's full amount of outstanding accounts receivable. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected.\n 35 \nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $99,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $17,000, or 14.9%. Research and development expenses related to the development of new dyeing and finishing products.\nImpairment loss. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment losses of $7,017,000 and $3,800,000, respectively, consisting of the following:\n \u25cf For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment losses of approximately $417,000 and $3,800,000, respectively, on ESR equipment. The valuations of the ESR equipment which, was reflected as equipment held for sale at December 31, 2015 and 2014 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and the amounts of the impairment charge, were based on the impairment assessments conducted on ESR equipment at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair value of the ESR equipment which is reflected as equipment held for sale was $0 and $422,500, respectively. \n \u25cf At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we conducted an impairment assessment on property and equipment in our forged rolled rings and related components and petroleum and chemical equipment segments to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2015 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these segments. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6,600,000 at December 31, 2015. We did not record any impairment charge on the property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014. \nLoss on sales contract dispute. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects, as described above. This customer demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB which was reflect as a liability at December 31, 2015. In connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,807,000 which has been reflected in operating expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n(Loss) income from operations. As a result of the factors described above, for the year ended December 31, 2015, loss from operations amounted to $(11,246,000), as compared to income from operations of $8,910,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) includes interest income, interest expense, grant income, foreign currency transaction gain/(loss), rental income, net, and other income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total other expense, net, amounted to $180,000 as compared to $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $97,000. The increase in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to a decrease in grant income of approximately $35,000, and the decrease in rental income, net, of approximately $102,000, offset by the increase in interest income of approximately $22,000, and the increase in other income of approximately $16,000.\nGrant income for 2014 represents incentives granted and received from the Chinese government to encourage technology innovation and related to the patents we received in 2014 for devices and parts of our airflow dyeing machine.\nRental income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2014, included rental income, net of related depreciation which was recognized as a reduction of rental income, from our equipment held for operating lease during 2014.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $1,345,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $4,561,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3,216,000, or 70.5%. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in taxable income generated by our operating entities in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Certain impairment losses are not treated as expenses under the tax laws of the PRC.\n 36 \nNet (loss) income. As a result of the foregoing, our net loss was $12,770,000, or $(3.24) per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with net income $4,266,000, or $1.15 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2014, a change of $17,036,000, or 399.3%.\nForeign currency translation loss. The functional currency of our subsidiaries and variable interest entities operating in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi ( RMB\u201d). The financial statements of our subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange (for the period) for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation loss of $4,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a foreign currency translation loss of $408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This non-cash loss had the effect of increasing/decreasing our reported comprehensive loss/income.\nComprehensive (loss) income. As a result of our foreign currency translation loss, we had comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $17,539,000, compared to comprehensive income of $3,858,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash balances of approximately $18,790,000 and $7,836,000, respectively. These funds are located in financial institutions located as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>Country: </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>United States </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 to\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working capital: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total current assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working capital: </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital increased by $1,334,000 to $24,931,000 at December 31, 2015 from $23,597,000 at December 31, 2014. This increase in working capital is primarily attributable to:\n \u25cf an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $10,955,000, related to net cash provided by operating activities, \n \u25cf an increase in advances to suppliers of approximately $473,000, \n \u25cf an increase in prepaid expenses and other of approximately $839,000, \n \u25cf a decrease in accounts payable of approximately $832,000, \n \u25cf a decrease in VAT and service taxes payable of approximately $231,000, and \n \u25cf a decrease in income taxes payable of approximately $271,000, \noffset by:\n \u25cf a significant decrease in accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, of approximately $4,492,000 primarily due to tighter credit sales policies, and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $1,759,000 at December 31, 2015 which represents an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts related to a notice of contract termination received by us by our largest petroleum and chemical equipment customer and discussed elsewhere in this report. \n 37 \n \u25cf a decrease in inventories, net of reserve for obsolete inventories, of approximately $2,414,000 primarily due to the decrease in inventories resulting from the decrease in expected near future sales and an increase in reserve of approximately $801,000 at December 31, 2015 relating to an increase in our reserve for obsolete inventories for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of our largest petroleum and chemical equipment customer who terminated their sales contract, \n \u25cf a decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately $155,000, and \n \u25cf a significant increase in total accrued expenses of approximately $5,302,000 which was primarily attributable to the increase in accrued expenses of approximately $5,562,000 related to a claimed breach by us of a sales contract as discussed in elsewhere in this report. \nBecause the exchange rate conversion is different for the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows, the changes in assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows are not necessarily identical with the comparable changes reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities was $11,731,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12,158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $427,000.\n \u25cf Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily

primarily due to the increase such allowance by approximately $1,759,000 related to a notice of contract breach described above, an increase in reserve for obsolete inventories of $962,000, primarily resulting from the increase in such reserve by approximately $801,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of our largest petroleum and chemical equipment customer who claimed we breach the sales contract, impairment of equipment held for sale of $417,000, loss from impairment of property and equipment of $6,599,000 and a loss from contract dispute of $5,807,000 as

of $227,000, a decrease in VAT and service taxes payable of $213,000, and a decrease in income taxes payable of $253,000. \u25cf Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily reflected net income of $4,266,000 and the add-back of non-cash items primarily consisting of depreciation of $8,470,000, amortization of land use rights of $96,000, an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts of $522,000, an increase in allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,166,000, a loss on impairment of equipment held for sale of $3,800,000 and stock-based

payable of $1,077,000, and a decrease in advances from customers of $953,000. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash flow used in investing activities reflects the purchase of property and equipment of approximately $12,000. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow used in investing activities reflects the purchase of property and equipment of $11,059,000, offset by refunds of payments of approximately $3,991,000 made by us with respect to purchase orders we had cancelled. In 2014, we examined and found some faults on the machinery delivered to us in the fourth quarter of 2014. Therefore, we cancelled the purchase order, returned the machinery to the supplier and received a refund of approximately $2,000,000, representing the payment which we had made. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014, a supplier did not deliver equipment to us because the supplier advised us that it could not import an important component necessary to complete our order on time. We cancelled the order and received refund of approximately $1,500,000, representing our advance payment for the equipment. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we cancelled a purchase order and received a refund of approximately $491,000, representing the payment we had made with respect to this order.\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities was approximately $161,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $1,624,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received proceeds from bank loans of approximately $4,503,000, and proceeds from the increase in bank acceptance notes payable of approximately $193,000, offset by repayments for bank loans of approximately $4,343,000, and payments for the increase in restricted cash of approximately $193,000. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received proceeds from bank loans of $3,907,000, proceeds from the decrease in restricted cash of $195,000 and net proceeds from sale of common stock of approximately $1,624,000 to our chief executive officer and his wife, offset by the repayments of bank loans of $3,907,000 and the decrease in bank acceptance notes payable of $195,000.\n 38 \nWe believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. We generally finance our operations through short term loans from our banks, which we refinance upon expiration. We do not have any long-term financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands), and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5+ years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank loans (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank acceptance notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Bank loans consisted of short term bank loans. Historically, we have refinanced these bank loans for an additional term of six months to one year and we expect to continue to refinance these loans upon expiration. \nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder's equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe produce and sell almost all of our products in China. Thus, most of our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations between RMB and US dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had unrealized foreign currency translation loss of approximately $4,769,000 and $408,000, respectively, because of changes in the exchange rate.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe are currently engaged in three business segments:\n \u25cf the dyeing and finishing equipment segment, in which we manufacture and sell textile dyeing and finishing machines; \n \u25cf the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufacture and sell high precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components; and \n \u25cf the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufacture and sell equipment, such as reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers and other components, to the petroleum and chemical industries. Sales in this segment commenced in the first quarter of 2015. We did not operate in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment during 2014. \nThe following table sets forth information as to revenues of our dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and related components, and petroleum and chemical equipment segments in dollars and as a percent of revenues (dollars in thousands):\n\n 25 \nIn 2015, challenging economic conditions, falling steel prices and limited availability of credit in China and well as challenges in operating in a new segment - the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, presented numerous challenges for our business. In our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our customers already upgraded to newer models last year and much of our remaining customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. Our forged rolled rings and related products segment in particular experienced a significant reduction in sales and operated at a loss during 2015.\nWe began to deliver parts and equipment in our petroleum and chemical equipment segment in 2015, which helped offset the decreases in revenue from our other two segments. In December 2015, we received a letter from this customer, pursuant to which the customer claimed that we were in breach of agreement because we were delinquent in the delivery of the products and those products that were delivered did not meet the required quality standards. The customer claimed that it is entitled to damages of RMB 36,103,640, or approximately $5,806,778 at December 31, 2015. As a result of the dispute with this customer, the Company, at December 31, 2015:\n \u25cf Recognized a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,806,778, which is reflected as an operating expense relating to the liability claimed by the customer in its letter; \u25cf Increased our accounts receivable reserve to fully reserve the approximately $1,759,000 due from this customer; \u25cf Increased our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $836,000, representing the remaining inventory manufactured to the specifications of this customer; and \u25cf Recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 relating to the manufacturing equipment which is specially designed to manufacture products for petroleum and chemical customer and is not otherwise used by the Company. \nWe are engaged in discussions with this customer, but cannot predict the results of these discussions. We are also evaluating our ability to continue in the petroleum and chemical segment, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to operate in this segment or that we will not suffer an impairment charge in 2016.\nWe conducted an impairment assessment to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2015 and 2014 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these segments. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment and equipment held for sale, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $7,000.000 and $3,800,000 in December 2015 and 2014, respectively. The charge for 2015 reflected impairment charges of approximately $5,100,000 relating to the forged rolled rings and related products segment, of which approximately $400,000 related to the equipment held for sale, and approximately $1,900,000 relating to the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, as described above. All of the impairment charges for 2014 related to the equipment held for sale.\nThe factors that affected our revenue, gross margin and net income in our segments during the year ended December 31, 2015, including the factors which resulted in significant declines in revenues in both our dyeing and finishing equipment segment and our forged rolled rings and related components segments, which are described below, are likely to continue to affect our operations in the near future. Our ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government's policy on such matters as the availability of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to alternative energy such as wind power, which affect our products for these industries. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues in any segment in the near future, if at all. Because of the nature of our products, our customers' projection of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date.\nDyeing and Finishing Equipment Segment\nRevenues from our dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased $13.2 million, or 31.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and in 2015, dyeing and finishing equipment segment revenues accounted for 58.5% of our total revenues. In order to reduce our business risk, we tightened our credit review policies in 2015.\nAdditionally, we experienced a slowdown in shipments of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already replaced older dyeing equipment with new equipment, and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines slowed down in 2015.\nWe expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or near the current yearly level for the near future.\n 26 \nForged Rolled Rings and Related Components Segment\nThrough our forged rolled rings and other related components division, we produce precision forged rolled rings and other forged components to the wind power and other industries. Our forged rolled rings and other related components are sold to manufacturers of industrial equipment. Forged rolled rings and other forged components for the wind industry are used in wind turbines, which are used to generate wind power.\nRevenues from our forged rolled rings and related components segment decreased $21.7 million, or 64.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, including wind power industry and other industries, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term, other factors, such as economic factors and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements of our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenue and net income will be affected. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation for forged rolled rings and related components for wind power and other industries and this market saturation, combined with the effects of lower oil and gas prices, has reduced the demand for construction of wind power facilities, and we expect that our revenues from forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease in the near future.\nWe believe that wind power will see its share of China's national energy mix gradually increase. While interest in wind power is increasing in many countries, we do not have the infrastructure and personnel to market our products in countries other than China, and we are continuing to limit our sales and marketing efforts to China to wind power and other industries customers.\nWe are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report. If we discontinue this segment, we anticipate that we may incur further impairment charges with respect to assets used in this segment.\nPetroleum and Chemical Equipment Segment\nThrough our petroleum and chemical equipment division, we produce and sell equipment such as coal chemical equipment, formaldehyde plant and downstream products, reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers to petroleum and chemical industries. We started to sell our petroleum and chemical equipment in February 2015. Revenue from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The market for petroleum products is mainly dominated by three major Chinese petroleum companies, and their capital expenditure and purchasing policy will have a significant effect both upon our ability to generate revenue from this segment and the gross margins which we can generate. Furthermore, because we sell our petroleum and chemical equipment products to a very small number of customers, the change in the purchasing policies of one or two customers could have a significant effect on our revenues from this segment. Sales to a large state-owned enterprise for parts and equipment to be used on a major chemical project in Xinjiang, which was generated in the year ended December 31, 2015, accounted for approximately $6.2 million, or 73.4% of the petroleum and chemical equipment segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs discussed above, in December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer in this segment, which was our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13% or our consolidated revenues for 2015, alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Pursuant to the sales contract, this customer demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB. In connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,806,778 which has been reflected as a loss from sale contract dispute in operating expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss and has been reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2015. Additionally, in December 2015, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer's full amount of outstanding accounts receivable. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected. Also, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of such customer and not readily saleable to other customers, and we incurred an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 for equipment used for this customer's products which did not have other uses.\nWe expect that our revenues from petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer.\n 27 \nWe are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report. Any discontinuation of this segment may result in further impairment charges relating to the assets associated with this segment.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nA major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to price fluctuations, and recently these fluctuations have been significant. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also can impair our margins. Three major suppliers provided approximately 47% and 49% of our purchases of inventories for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other supplier accounted for 10% or more of our purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nPursuant to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nThe Huayang Companies are considered VIEs, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with the Huayang Companies pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of the Huayang Companies' net income. In accordance with these agreements, the Huayang Companies shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service the Huayang Companies.\nThe accounts of the Huayang Companies are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As VIEs, the Huayang Companies sales are included in our total sales, their income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of the Huayang Companies' net income, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in the Huayang Companies that require consolidation of the Huayang Companies financial statements with our financial statements.\n 28 \nAccounts Receivable\nWe have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAs a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the weighted average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing and delivery.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\n\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the year of disposition.\nIncluded in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consists of factories and office buildings under construction and machinery pending installation and includes the costs of construction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\n 29 \nLand Use Rights\nThere is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized on the straight-line method over the land use right terms.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and other components, petroleum and chemical equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally is recognized over the contract period. For 2015 and 2014, amounts allocated to installation and warranty revenues were minimal. Based on historical experience, warranty service calls and any related labor costs have been minimal.\nRental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease and is presented net of depreciation.\nAll other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions, including the forged rolled rings, are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are governed by the income tax laws of the PRC and the United States. Income taxes are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The charge for taxes is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is changed to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award. The Accounting Standards Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\n 30 \nPursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date.\u201d The expense is recognized over the period of services or the vesting period, whichever is applicable. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We record compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.\nCurrency Exchange Rates\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and VIEs is the RMB. All of our sales are denominated in RMB. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and RMB affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses.\nOur exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between signing of sales contracts and settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into RMB, the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of shareholders' equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.\nOur financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our parent company. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates is RMB. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of RMB against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-10, Technical Corrections and Improvements\u201d ( ASU 2015-10\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-10 cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-10 represent changes to clarify the ASC, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the ASC that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Additionally, some of the amendments will make the ASC easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving the presentation of guidance in the ASC. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in ASU 2015-10. The amendments in ASU 2015-10 that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the issuance of ASU 2015-10. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). The amendments in this update require an entity to measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 (the amendments in ASU 2015-11 do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is uncharged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d). ASU 2015-11 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n 31 \nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 indicated as a percentage of revenues (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth information as to the revenues, gross profit and gross margin for our three business segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\n\n 32 \nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had revenues of $49,566,000, as compared to revenues of $75,959,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $26,393,000 or 34.7%. The decrease in revenues for 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in revenue from both our forged rolled rings and related components segment and our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, partially offset by revenues generated from petroleum and chemical equipment segment. The change in revenues is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nDyeing and finishing equipment segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment decreased by approximately $13,198,000 or 31.3% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In order to reduce our business risk, we tightened our credit review policies in 2015. Additionally, we experienced an anticipated slowdown in shipments of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many customers had replaced older dyeing equipment with our low-emission airflow dyeing machine in 2014, and we believe that orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines have slowed down in 2015 because the remaining potential customer base included more companies that did not have the ability to make the significant capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their equipment. Accordingly, our revenues from dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nForged rolled rings and related products segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from the sale of forged rolled rings and related components decreased by approximately $21,669,000, or 64.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term other factors, such as economic factors and the fluctuations in the price of oil and coal and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements by our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenues and net income will be affected. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation, and we expect that our revenues from customers of forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease for the near future.\nPetroleum and chemical equipment segment\nWe sought to expand our business to oil and natural gas industries since 2013. We received the certifications needed to serve these markets in mid-2013. However, we did not generate revenues or incur manufacturing costs from the petroleum and chemical segment until the first quarter of 2015. Our revenue in this segment is highly dependent upon sales to the three major Chinese petrochemical companies, whose purchasing policies affect both our revenue and gross margin for this segment, one of which accounted for 73.4% of revenue from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Accordingly, we do not expect any further revenues from this customer and expect that our revenues from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes the cost of raw materials, labor, depreciation and other overhead costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenues was $42,216,000 as compared to $58,218,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $16,002,000, or 27.5%. Cost of revenues for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was $22,514,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $32,450,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues related to the manufacture of forged rolled rings and related components was $12,512,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $25,768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues for the petroleum and chemical equipment was $7,190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Since the manufacture and sale of the petroleum and chemical products commenced in the first quarter of 2015, we had neither revenues nor cost of revenues from this segment in the year ended December 31, 2014.\n 33 \nGross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit was $7,350,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $17,741,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of 14.8% and 23.4%, respectively.\n.\nGross profit for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was $6,497,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $9,759,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of approximately 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, a slight decrease year over year. We expect that our gross margin from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at its current levels.\nWe incurred a negative gross profit from forged rolled rings and related components segment of $431,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to gross profit of $7,982,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing gross margins of approximately (3.6)% and 23.6%, respectively. The significant decrease in our gross margin for the forged rolled rings and related components segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributed to the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, combined with a modest increase in labor costs.\nAt December 31, 2015, we conducted an impairment assessment on property and equipment in our forged rolled rings and related components segment to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in the Company's forged rolled rings and related components segment and reduced the net book value of this equipment as discussed below. In 2016, we expect depreciation to be lower due to the reduction of net book value reflecting the impairment of equipment in the petroleum and chemical equipment and forged rolled rings and related products segments. We expect that our gross margin from forged rolled rings and related components segment will continue to be low in 2016 because we are not optimistic about the market for forged rolled rings and related products. We are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report.\nGross profit for the petroleum and chemical equipment segment was $1,284,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing gross margin of approximately 15.2% and was effected by an increase in our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000. As a result of the December 2015 notice of breach of contract, described above, from our largest customer, which was a customer in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventories by approximately $836,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of such customer, which are not readily saleable to other customers. Many companies bid for the petroleum and chemical equipment orders. Since we are a small company and just entered this market in February 2015 and our customer base is small, we have offered a lower price in order to generate orders. Therefore, our gross margin for petroleum and chemical equipment is low. The low gross margin in this segment was one of factors in overall reduced gross margins, along with the negative gross margin from the forged rolled rings and related components in 2015. Due to the loss of our largest customer in this segment, we are evaluating the viability of this segment on an ongoing basis and, if we determine that it is not likely that we will be able to operate this segment profitably, we may discontinue operating in this segment. However, we have not completed our evaluation as of the date of this report.\nOperating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses were $18,595,000 as compared to $8,831,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $9,764,000, or 110.6%, and consisted of the following:\n.\nDepreciation. Depreciation was $8,129,000 and $8,470,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was included in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\n\n 34 \nThe depreciation expense for cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 remained roughly consistent as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe increase in depreciation expense for operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was mainly attributable to the increase in depreciation related to newly purchased office equipment and furniture and from office and dormitory buildings and other improvements which we started depreciating in the second half of 2014.\nThe depreciation expense for other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was related to the equipment then held for operating lease during 2014 and was reflected as an offset against rental income.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,782,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3,672,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $890,000 or 24.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\n\n \u25cf Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $54,000, or 15.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investor relations service fees of approximately $11,000, and a decrease in inspection and testing fees for our dyeing and finishing equipment segment of approximately $31,000, and a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately $12,000. \n \u25cf Payroll and related benefits for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $172,000, or 17.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $90,000 which reflected the decrease in stock-based bonuses incurred and paid to our management in 2015, and a decrease in employee salaries and related benefits of approximately $82,000 due to the stricter control in general and administrative personnel. We expect that payroll and related benefits will remain in its current level with minimal increase in the near future. \n \u25cf Travel and entertainment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $148,000, or 31.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to stricter control on corporation expenditure. \n \u25cf Shipping expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $457,000, or 33.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was mainly attributable to the decrease in our revenues as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. \n \u25cf Other selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $59,000, or 12.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in vehicle expenses of approximately $18,000, a decrease in office supply of approximately $3,000, a decrease in miscellaneous taxes of approximately $11,000, and a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately $27,000. \nBad debt expense. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded bad debt expense of $2,062,000 and $522,000, respectively. Based on our periodic review of accounts receivable balances, we adjusted the allowance for doubtful accounts after considering management's evaluation of the collectability of individual receivable balances, including the analysis of subsequent collections, the customers' collection history, the write off of uncollectible receivables against the existing reserve, and recent economic events. In December 2015, based on a notice of contract breach from our largest petroleum and chemical equipment segment customer, as described above, the customer requested some relief and has not paid the remaining outstanding accounts receivable balance of approximately $1,759,000. Accordingly, in addition to general changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer's full amount of outstanding accounts receivable. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected.\n 35 \nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $99,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $17,000, or 14.9%. Research and development expenses related to the development of new dyeing and finishing products.\nImpairment loss. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment losses of $7,017,000 and $3,800,000, respectively, consisting of the following:\n \u25cf For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment losses of approximately $417,000 and $3,800,000, respectively, on ESR equipment. The valuations of the ESR equipment which, was reflected as equipment held for sale at December 31, 2015 and 2014 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and the amounts of the impairment charge, were based on the impairment assessments conducted on ESR equipment at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair value of the ESR equipment which is reflected as equipment held for sale was $0 and $422,500, respectively. \n \u25cf At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we conducted an impairment assessment on property and equipment in our forged rolled rings and related components and petroleum and chemical equipment segments to determine the estimated fair market value of property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2015 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these segments. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6,600,000 at December 31, 2015. We did not record any impairment charge on the property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014. \nLoss on sales contract dispute. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects, as described above. This customer demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB which was reflect as a liability at December 31, 2015. In connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of $5,807,000 which has been reflected in operating expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n(Loss) income from operations. As a result of the factors described above, for the year ended December 31, 2015, loss from operations amounted to $(11,246,000), as compared to income from operations of $8,910,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) includes interest income, interest expense, grant income, foreign currency transaction gain/(loss), rental income, net, and other income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total other expense, net, amounted to $180,000 as compared to $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $97,000. The increase in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to a decrease in grant income of approximately $35,000, and the decrease in rental income, net, of approximately $102,000, offset by the increase in interest income of approximately $22,000, and the increase in other income of approximately $16,000.\nGrant income for 2014 represents incentives granted and received from the Chinese government to encourage technology innovation and related to the patents we received in 2014 for devices and parts of our airflow dyeing machine.\nRental income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2014, included rental income, net of related depreciation which was recognized as a reduction of rental income, from our equipment held for operating lease during 2014.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $1,345,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $4,561,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3,216,000, or 70.5%. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in taxable income generated by our operating entities in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Certain impairment losses are not treated as expenses under the tax laws of the PRC.\n 36 \nNet (loss) income. As a result of the foregoing, our net loss was $12,770,000, or $(3.24) per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with net income $4,266,000, or $1.15 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2014, a change of $17,036,000, or 399.3%.\nForeign currency translation loss. The functional currency of our subsidiaries and variable interest entities operating in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi ( RMB\u201d). The financial statements of our subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange (for the period) for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation loss of $4,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a foreign currency translation loss of $408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This non-cash loss had the effect of increasing/decreasing our reported comprehensive loss/income.\nComprehensive (loss) income. As a result of our foreign currency translation loss, we had comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $17,539,000, compared to comprehensive income of $3,858,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash balances of approximately $18,790,000 and $7,836,000, respectively. These funds are located in financial institutions located as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\nOur working capital increased by $1,334,000 to $24,931,000 at December 31, 2015 from $23,597,000 at December 31, 2014. This increase in working capital is primarily attributable to:\n \u25cf an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $10,955,000, related to net cash provided by operating activities, \n \u25cf an increase in advances to suppliers of approximately $473,000, \n \u25cf an increase in prepaid expenses and other of approximately $839,000, \n \u25cf a decrease in accounts payable of approximately $832,000, \n \u25cf a decrease in VAT and service taxes payable of approximately $231,000, and \n \u25cf a decrease in income taxes payable of approximately $271,000, \noffset by:\n \u25cf a significant decrease in accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, of approximately $4,492,000 primarily due to tighter credit sales policies, and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $1,759,000 at December 31, 2015 which represents an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts related to a notice of contract termination received by us by our largest petroleum and chemical equipment customer and discussed elsewhere in this report. \n 37 \n \u25cf a decrease in inventories, net of reserve for obsolete inventories, of approximately $2,414,000 primarily due to the decrease in inventories resulting from the decrease in expected near future sales and an increase in reserve of approximately $801,000 at December 31, 2015 relating to an increase in our reserve for obsolete inventories for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of our largest petroleum and chemical equipment customer who terminated their sales contract, \n \u25cf a decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately $155,000, and \n \u25cf a significant increase in total accrued expenses of approximately $5,302,000 which was primarily attributable to the increase in accrued expenses of approximately $5,562,000 related to a claimed breach by us of a sales contract as discussed in elsewhere in this report. \nBecause the exchange rate conversion is different for the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows, the changes in assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows are not necessarily identical with the comparable changes reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities was $11,731,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12,158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $427,000.\n \u25cf Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily reflected the add-back of non-cash items primarily consisting of depreciation of $8,129,000, amortization of land use rights of $95,000, an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,062,000 primarily due to the increase such allowance by approximately $1,759,000 related to a notice of contract breach described above, an increase in reserve for obsolete inventories of $962,000, primarily resulting from the increase in such reserve by approximately $801,000 for all remaining inventories manufactured to the specifications of our largest petroleum and chemical equipment customer who claimed we breach the sales contract, impairment of equipment held for sale of $417,000, loss from impairment of property and equipment of $6,599,000 and a loss from contract dispute of $5,807,000 as discussed in elsewhere in this report, and stock-based compensation of $286,000, and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of a decrease in accounts receivable of $1,477,000, a decrease in inventories of $1,318,000, a decrease in deferred tax assets of $140,000, offset by our net loss of $12,770,000, and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $791,000, an increase in advances to suppliers of $526,000, a decrease in accounts payable of $624,000, a decrease in accrued expenses of $227,000, a decrease in VAT and service taxes payable of $213,000, and a decrease in income taxes payable of $253,000. \u25cf Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily reflected net income of $4,266,000 and the add-back of non-cash items primarily consisting of depreciation of $8,470,000, amortization of land use rights of $96,000, an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts of $522,000, an increase in allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,166,000, a loss on impairment of equipment held for sale of $3,800,000 and stock-based compensation of $376,000, and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of a decrease in notes receivable of $586,000, a decrease in inventories of $471,000, a decrease in prepaid value-added taxes on purchases of $487,000, a decrease in advances to suppliers of $126,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $164,000, an increase in VAT and service taxes payable of $375,000, offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of $5,669,000, an increase in deferred tax assets of $1,080,000, a decrease in accounts payable of $872,000, a decrease in income taxes payable of $1,077,000, and a decrease in advances from customers of $953,000. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash flow used in investing activities reflects the purchase of property and equipment of approximately $12,000. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow used in investing activities reflects the purchase of property and equipment of $11,059,000, offset by refunds of payments of approximately $3,991,000 made by us with respect to purchase orders we had cancelled. In 2014, we examined and found some faults on the machinery delivered to us in the fourth quarter of 2014. Therefore, we cancelled the purchase order, returned the machinery to the supplier and received a refund of approximately $2,000,000, representing the payment which we had made. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014, a supplier did not deliver equipment to us because the supplier advised us that it could not import an important component necessary to complete our order on time. We cancelled the order and received refund of approximately $1,500,000, representing our advance payment for the equipment. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we cancelled a purchase order and received a refund of approximately $491,000, representing the payment we had made with respect to this order.\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities was approximately $161,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $1,624,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received proceeds from bank loans of approximately $4,503,000, and proceeds from the increase in bank acceptance notes payable of approximately $193,000, offset by repayments for bank loans of approximately $4,343,000, and payments for the increase in restricted cash of approximately $193,000. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received proceeds from bank loans of $3,907,000, proceeds from the decrease in restricted cash of $195,000 and net proceeds from sale of common stock of approximately $1,624,000 to our chief executive officer and his wife, offset by the repayments of bank loans of $3,907,000 and the decrease in bank acceptance notes payable of $195,000.\n 38 \nWe believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. We generally finance our operations through short term loans from our banks, which we refinance upon expiration. We do not have any long-term financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands), and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.\n\n (1) Bank loans consisted of short term bank loans. Historically, we have refinanced these bank loans for an additional term of six months to one year and we expect to continue to refinance these loans upon expiration. \nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder's equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe produce and sell almost all of our products in China. Thus, most of our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations between RMB and US dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had unrealized foreign currency translation loss of approximately $4,769,000 and $408,000, respectively, because of changes in the exchange rate.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.", "item_7_tables": "Table 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td>

dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and components, and petroleum and chemical equipment. \n\n- Revenues decreased 34.7% in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to lower sales in the dyeing/finishing and forged rings segments, partially offset by new revenues from the petroleum/chemical segment.\n\n- Gross margin declined from 23.4% in 2014 to 14.8% in 2015, driven by lower volumes, higher costs, and inventory write-downs. \n\n- Operating expenses increased 110.6% in 2015, primarily due to impairment charges, loss from a sales contract dispute, and higher bad debt expense. This resulted in an operating loss in 2015 compared to income in 2014.\n\n- Net loss was $12.8 million in 2015 versus net income of $4.3 million in 2014. The loss was mainly attributable to the impairment charges, contract dispute loss, and overall revenue decline. \n\n- Cash flow from operations remained strong at $11.7 million in 2015, albeit lower than 2014. The company relied on short-term bank loans for financing needs.\n\n- Working capital increased modestly as higher cash levels were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories. \n\n- The company faces uncertainty in some of its business segments and is evaluating their viability going forward."}
