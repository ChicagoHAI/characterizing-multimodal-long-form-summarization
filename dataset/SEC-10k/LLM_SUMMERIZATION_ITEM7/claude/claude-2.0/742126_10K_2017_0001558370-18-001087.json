MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nUS Ecology, Inc. is a leading North American provider of environmental services to commercial and government entities. The Company addresses the complex waste management needs of its customers, offering treatment, disposal and recycling of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste, as well as a wide range of complementary field and industrial services. US Ecology's comprehensive knowledge of the waste business, its collection of waste management facilities and focus on safety, environmental compliance, and customer service enables us to effectively meet the needs of our customers and to build long-lasting relationships.\nWe have fixed facilities and service centers operating in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our fixed facilities include five RCRA subtitle C hazardous waste landfills and one LLRW landfill located near Beatty, Nevada; Richland, Washington; Robstown, Texas; Grand View, Idaho; Detroit, Michigan and Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. These facilities\ngenerate revenue from fees charged to treat and dispose of waste and from fees charged to perform various field and industrial services for our customers.\nOn November 1, 2015, we sold our Allstate Power Vac, Inc. ( Allstate\u201d) subsidiary to a private investor group. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur operations are managed in two reportable segments reflecting our internal management reporting structure and nature of services offered as follows:\nEnvironmental Services-This segment provides a broad range of hazardous material management services including transportation, recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at Company-owned landfill, wastewater and other treatment facilities.\nField & Industrial Services-This segment provides packaging and collection of hazardous waste and total waste management solutions at customer sites and through our 10-day transfer facilities. Services include on-site management, waste characterization, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. This segment also provides specialty services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response and other services to commercial and industrial facilities and to government entities.\nIn order to provide insight into the underlying drivers of our waste volumes and related treatment and disposal ( T&D\u201d) revenues, we evaluate period-to-period changes in our T&D revenue for our Environmental Services segment based on the industry of the waste generator, based on North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS\u201d) codes.\nThe composition of the Environmental Services segment T&D revenues by waste generator industry for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Treatment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand Disposal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfor the Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnded\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGenerator Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChemical Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMetal Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBroker / TSDF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRefining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGovernment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMining, Exploration and Production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWaste Management & Remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExcludes all transportation service revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes retail and wholesale trade, rate regulated, construction and other industries\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also categorize our Environmental Services T&D revenue as either Base Business\u201d or Event Business\u201d based on the underlying nature of the revenue source.\nBase Business consists of waste streams from ongoing industrial activities and tends to be reoccurring in nature. We define Event Business as non-recurring projects that are expected to equal or exceed 1,000 tons, with Base Business defined as all other business not meeting the definition of Event Business. The duration of Event Business projects can last from a several-week cleanup of a contaminated site to a multiple year cleanup project.\nDuring 2017, Base Business revenue growth was up 5% compared to 2016. Base Business revenue was approximately 78% of total 2017 T&D revenue, down from 82% in 2016. Our business is highly competitive and no assurance can be given that we will maintain these revenue levels or increase our market share.\nA significant portion of our disposal revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business projects which vary widely in size, duration and unit pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 22% of our T&D revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event Business, diverse spectrum of waste types received and widely varying unit pricing necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability may be influenced by general and industry-specific economic conditions, funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions or court orders, public controversy, litigation, weather, commercial real estate, closed military bases and other project timing, government appropriation and funding cycles and other factors. The types and amounts of waste received from Base Business also vary from quarter to quarter.\nThis variability can also cause significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year differences in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and net income. While we pursue many projects months or years in advance of work performance, cleanup project opportunities routinely arise with little or no prior notice. These market dynamics are inherent to the waste disposal business and are factored into our projections and externally communicated business outlook statements. Our projections combine historical experience with identified sales pipeline opportunities, new or expanded service line projections and prevailing market conditions.\nDepending on project-specific customer needs and competitive economics, transportation services may be offered at or near our cost to help secure new business. For waste transported by rail from the eastern United States and other locations distant from our Grand View, Idaho and Robstown, Texas facilities, transportation-related revenue can account for as much as 75% of total project revenue. While bundling transportation and disposal services reduces overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenue ( gross margin\u201d), this value-added service has allowed us to win multiple projects that management believes we could not have otherwise competed for successfully. Our Company-owned fleet of gondola railcars, which is periodically supplemented with railcars obtained under operating leases, has reduced our transportation expenses by largely eliminating reliance on more costly short-term rentals. These Company-owned railcars also help us to win business during times of demand-driven railcar scarcity.\nThe increased waste volumes resulting from projects won through this bundled service strategy further drive operating leverage benefits inherent to the disposal business, increasing profitability. While waste treatment and other variable costs are project-specific, the incremental earnings contribution from large and small projects generally increases as overall disposal volumes increase. Based on past experience, management believes that maximizing operating income, net income and earnings per share is a higher priority than maintaining or increasing gross margin. We intend to continue aggressively bidding bundled transportation and disposal services based on this proven strategy.\nWe serve oil refineries, chemical production plants, steel mills, waste brokers/aggregators serving small manufacturers and other industrial customers that are generally affected by the prevailing economic conditions and credit environment. Adverse conditions may cause our customers as well as those they serve to curtail operations, resulting in lower waste production and/or delayed spending on off-site waste shipments, maintenance, waste cleanup projects and other work. Factors that can impact general economic conditions and the level of spending by customers include, but are not limited to, consumer and industrial spending, increases in fuel and energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other global economic factors affecting spending behavior. Market forces may also induce customers to reduce or cease operations, declare bankruptcy, liquidate or relocate to other countries, any of which could adversely affect our business. To the extent business is either government funded or driven by government regulations or enforcement actions, we believe it is less susceptible to general economic conditions. Spending by government agencies may be reduced due to declining tax revenues resulting from a weak economy or changes in policy. Disbursement of funds appropriated by Congress may also be delayed for various reasons.\nOur results of operations have been affected by certain significant events during the past three fiscal years including, but not limited to:\n2017 Events\nGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Asset Impairment Charges: Based on the results of the Company's annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, during the fourth quarter we recorded a $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge in our Resource Recovery reporting unit and a $3.4 million impairment charge on the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit associated with our Resource Recovery business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company calculated a provisional amount of the impact of the Tax Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as a result, recorded a $23.8 million net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWrite-off of Deferred Financing Costs: In connection with the refinancing of the Company's outstanding debt, we wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n2016 Events\nDivestiture of Augusta, Georgia Facility: On April 5, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our Augusta, Georgia facility for cash proceeds of $1.9 million. The Augusta, Georgia facility was reported as part of our Environmental Services segment. Sales, net income and total assets of the Augusta, Georgia facility are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations in any period presented. We recognized a $1.9 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of the Augusta, Georgia facility, which is included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition of Environmental Services Inc.: On May 2, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Environmental Services Inc., ( ESI\u201d), an environmental services company based in Tilbury, Ontario, Canada. The total purchase price was $4.9 million, net of cash acquired, and was funded with cash on hand. Revenues and total assets of ESI are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We recorded $1.5 million of intangible assets and $1.0 million of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the acquisition. Definite-lived intangibles will be amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 14 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually.\nAcquisition of Vernon, California Facility: On October 1, 2016, the Company acquired the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC. The total purchase price was $5.0 million and was funded with cash on hand. Revenues and total assets of the Vernon, California facility are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We recorded $3.2 million of intangible assets and $354,000 of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the acquisition. Definite-lived intangibles will be amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 20 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually.\n2015 Events\nSale of Allstate Power Vac, Inc. ( Allstate\u201d) and Goodwill Impairment: On November 1, 2015, we sold our Allstate subsidiary to a private investor group for cash proceeds of $58.8 million. Allstate represented the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this divestiture and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Based on this analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015. We recognized a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Allstate, including transaction-related costs, of $542,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we received additional cash proceeds of $827,000 in settlement of final post-closing adjustments and recognized an additional $178,000 pre-tax gain. Gains and losses related to the sale of Allstate are included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. Cash proceeds from the transaction were used to repay debt. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results and percentage of

T&D revenue increased 8% in 2017, primarily as a result of a 23% increase in project-based Event Business revenue and a 5% increase in Base Business revenue. Transportation and logistics service revenue increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting more Event Business projects utilizing the Company's transportation and logistics services. Tons of waste disposed of or processed increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nT&D revenue from recurring Base Business waste generators increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 and comprised 78% of total T&D revenue. During 2017, increases in Base Business T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, refining, general manufacturing, and Other\u201d industry groups were partially offset by decreases in T&D revenue from Base Business in the broker/TSDF industry group.\nT&D revenue from Event Business waste generators increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016 and comprised 22% of total T&D revenue. The increase in Event Business T&D revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects higher T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, metal manufacturing, government and Other\u201d industry groups, partially offset by lower T&D revenue from the general manufacturing industry group. The increase in revenue from the chemical manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to a large East Coast remedial cleanup project. The decrease in revenue from the general manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to lower Event Business volume.\nThe following table summarizes combined Base Business and Event Business T&D revenue growth, within the Environmental Services segment, by waste generator industry for 2017 compared to 2016:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nT&D Revenue Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChemical Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWaste Management & Remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGovernment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMining and E&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRefining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMetal Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBroker / TSDF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment revenue decreased 2% to $137.7 million in 2017 compared with $139.9 million in 2016. The decrease in Field & Industrial Services segment revenue is primarily attributable to the expiration of a contract that was not renewed or replaced and softer overall market conditions for industrial and remediation services.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit increased 4% to $153.1 million in 2017, up from $147.6 million in 2016. Total gross margin was 30% for 2017 compared with 31% for 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment gross profit increased 6% to $135.0 million in 2017, up from $126.8 million in 2016. This increase primarily reflects higher T&D volumes in 2017 compared to 2016. Total segment gross margin was 37% for 2017 compared with 38% for 2016. T&D gross margin was 40% for 2017 compared with 42% for 2016. The decrease in T&D gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of the temporary closure of one of our treatment facilities due to wind damage and incremental costs associated with the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and Florida that impacted our operations in 2017.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment gross profit decreased 13% to $18.2 million in 2017, down from $20.8 million in 2016. Total segment gross margin was 13% for 2017 compared with 15% for 2016. The decrease in segment gross margin is attributable to lower route density in our small quantity generation services due to a contract that was not renewed in late 2016 and a less favorable service mix for our industrial and remediation services in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTotal SG&A increased to $84.5 million, or 17% of total revenue, in 2017 compared with $77.6 million, or 16% of total revenue, in 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment SG&A increased 13% to $24.2 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2017 compared with $21.4 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2016, primarily reflecting higher labor and incentive compensation costs, higher property tax expenses and lower gains on sale of assets, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and higher insurance proceeds in 2017 compared to 2016.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment SG&A decreased 8% to $9.3 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2017 compared with $10.1 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2016. The decrease in segment SG&A primarily reflects lower bad debt expense and higher insurance proceeds, partially offset by higher labor and incentive compensation costs in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A was $51.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2017 compared with $46.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2016, primarily reflecting higher labor and incentive compensation costs in 2017 compared to 2016.\nComponents of Adjusted EBITDA\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate for 2017 was -14.9% compared to 38.1% in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 by the U.S. government. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and imposes a deemed repatriation tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. We re-measured our net deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a provisional benefit of $25.2 million to our income tax expense. We also recorded a provisional charge of $1.4 million to our income tax expense for the deemed repatriation transition tax. While we are able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d), and actions we may take. We are continuing to gather additional\ninformation to determine the final impact. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was also attributable to a higher proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2017 which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by non-recurring non-deductible impairment charges as well as a higher effective state tax rate driven by changes in apportionment of income between the various states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2017, we have exhausted all of our federal net operating loss carry forwards ( NOLs\u201d) and have approximately $8.9 million in state and local NOLs for which we maintain a substantial valuation allowance. We maintain a valuation allowance on state and local NOLs when we no longer do business within a state or locality or determine it is unlikely that we will utilize these NOLs in the future. We consider it more likely than not that we will not utilize the majority of these NOLs in the future.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $18.2 million in 2017 compared with $17.3 million in 2016. The Company wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the Former Credit Agreement that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time non-cash charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017. This increase is partially offset by a lower effective interest rate under the New Credit Agreement compared to the Former Credit Agreement and reduced debt levels in 2017 compared to 2016.\nForeign currency gain (loss)\nWe recognized a $516,000 non-cash foreign currency gain in 2017 compared with a $138,000 non-cash foreign currency loss in 2016. Foreign currency gains and losses reflect changes in business activity conducted in a currency other than the USD, our functional currency. Our Canadian subsidiaries' facilities are located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec and Tilbury, Ontario, Canada and use the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) as their functional currency. Additionally, we established intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the CAD, and our parent company, US Ecology, as part of a tax and treasury management strategy allowing for repayment of third-party bank debt. These intercompany loans are payable by our Canadian subsidiaries to US Ecology in CAD requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our statements of operations based on USD/CAD currency movements from period to period. At December 31, 2017, we had $21.4 million of intercompany loans subject to currency revaluation.\nGain on divestiture\nOther income in 2016 includes approximately $2.0 million related to the gain on sale of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016 and final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture.\nDepreciation and amortization of plant and equipment\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $28.3 million in 2017 compared with $25.3 million in 2016, primarily reflecting additional depreciation expense on assets placed in service in 2017.\nAmortization of intangibles\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $9.9 million in 2017 compared with $10.6 million in 2016.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense increased 34% to $3.9 million in 2017, compared with $2.9 million 2016 as a result of an increase in equity-based awards granted to employees.\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities decreased to $3.0 million in 2017 compared with $4.0 million in 2016, primarily reflecting non-cash adjustments to post-closure liabilities recorded in 2017 due to changes in cost estimates associated with closed sites.\nImpairment charges\nBased on the results of our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we recorded a $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge in our Resource Recovery reporting unit and a $3.4 million impairment charge on the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit of our Resource Recovery business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue\nTotal revenue decreased 15% to $477.7 million in 2016, compared with $563.1 million in 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment revenue decreased 6% to $337.8 million in 2016, compared to $359.0 million in 2015. T&D revenue decreased 5% in 2016, primarily as a result of a 30% decrease in project-based Event Business. Transportation and logistics service revenue decreased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting fewer Event Business projects utilizing the Company's transportation and logistics services. Tons of waste disposed of or processed decreased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015.\nT&D revenue from recurring Base Business waste generators increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015 and comprised 82% of total T&D revenue. During 2016, increases in Base Business T&D revenue from the refining, Other\u201d, utilities and general manufacturing industry groups were partially offset by decreases in T&D revenue from Base Business in the chemical manufacturing and broker/TSDF industry groups.\nT&D revenue from Event Business waste generators decreased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015 and comprised 18% of total T&D revenue. The decrease in Event Business T&D revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects lower T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, refining and government industry groups, partially offset by higher T&D revenue from the general manufacturing and Other\u201d industry groups. The decrease in revenue from the chemical manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to the completion of a large East Coast remedial cleanup project in the third quarter of 2015 and the completion of a nuclear fuels fabrication plant decommissioning in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue from the refining and government industry groups is primarily attributable to lower Event Business volumes.\nThe following table summarizes combined Base Business and Event Business T&D revenue growth, within the Environmental Services segment, by waste generator industry for 2016 compared to 2015:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nT&D Revenue Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWaste Management & Remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRefining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMetal Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBroker / TSDF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMining and E&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGovernment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChemical Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment revenue decreased 31% to $139.9 million in 2016 compared with $204.0 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the divested Allstate business which contributed segment revenue of $59.1 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit decreased 14% to $147.6 million in 2016, down from $171.4 million in 2015. Total gross margin was 31% for 2016 compared with 30% for 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment gross profit decreased 8% to $126.8 million in 2016, down from $137.6 million in 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower T&D volumes in 2016 compared to 2015. Total segment gross margin was 38% for both 2016 and 2015. T&D gross margin was 42% for 2016 compared with 43% for 2015.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment gross profit decreased 38% to $20.8 million in 2016, down from $33.8 million in 2015. Total segment gross margin was 15% for 2016 compared with 17% for 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed segment gross profit of $12.4 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTotal SG&A decreased to $77.6 million, or 16% of total revenue, in 2016 compared with $93.1 million, or 17% of total revenue, in 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment SG&A decreased 6% to $21.4 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2016 compared with $22.8 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2015, primarily reflecting higher gains on sales of assets in 2016 compared to 2015.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment SG&A decreased 54% to $10.1 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2016 compared with $22.0 million, or 11% of segment revenue, in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed segment SG&A of $10.9 million for our period of ownership in 2015. The remaining decrease in segment SG&A primarily reflects lower employee labor costs in 2016 compared to 2015.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A was $46.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2016 compared with $48.4 million, or 9% of total revenue, in 2015, primarily reflecting lower business development expenses and lower professional services expenses in 2016 compared to 2015.\nComponents of Adjusted EBITDA\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate for 2016 was 38.1% compared to 45.3% in 2015. The decrease reflects nonrecurring non-deductible goodwill impairment charges incurred in 2015, a nondeductible loss on the sale of the Allstate business recorded\nduring 2015 and a decrease in our U.S. effective tax rate, driven by a lower overall effective state tax rate. The lower effective state tax rate was driven by changes in apportionment of income and deferred taxes between the various states in which we operate. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a lower proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2016, which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $17,000 in federal NOLs acquired from EQ. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $12.7 million in state and local NOLs for which we maintain a substantial valuation allowance. We maintain a valuation allowance on state and local NOLs when we no longer do business within a state or locality or determine it is unlikely that we will utilize these NOLs in the future. We consider it more likely than not that we will not utilize the majority of these NOLs in the future.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $17.3 million in 2016 compared with $23.4 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to $291,000 of incremental non-cash amortization of deferred financing fees associated with debt principal payments in 2016 compared with $2.4 million of incremental amortization in 2015. The remaining decrease is attributable to lower debt levels in 2016 compared with 2015.\nForeign currency gain (loss)\nWe recognized a $138,000 non-cash foreign currency loss in 2016 compared with a $2.2 million non-cash foreign currency loss in 2015. Foreign currency gains and losses reflect changes in business activity conducted in a currency other than the USD, our functional currency. Our Canadian subsidiaries' facilities are located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec and Tilbury, Ontario, Canada and use the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) as their functional currency. Additionally, we established intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the CAD, and our parent company, US Ecology, as part of a tax and treasury management strategy allowing for repayment of third-party bank debt. These intercompany loans are payable by our Canadian subsidiaries to US Ecology in CAD requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our statements of operations based on USD/CAD currency movements from period to period. At December 31, 2016, we had $20.8 million of intercompany loans subject to currency revaluation.\nGain on divestiture\nOther income in 2016 includes approximately $2.0 million related to the gain on sale of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016 and final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture.\nDepreciation and amortization of plant and equipment\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $25.3 million in 2016 compared with $27.9 million in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed depreciation and amortization expense of $2.2 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nAmortization of intangibles\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $10.6 million in 2016 compared with $12.3 million in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed intangible assets amortization expense of $1.4 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense increased 27% to $2.9 million in 2016, compared with $2.3 million 2015 as a result of an increase in equity-based awards granted to employees.\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities was $4.0 million in 2016 compared with $4.6 million in 2015.\nImpairment charges\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Allstate to a private investor group. Allstate represented the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this agreement and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Based on this analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new senior secured credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d). At December 31, 2017, we had $27.0 million in cash and cash equivalents immediately available and $216.7 million of borrowing capacity available under the New Credit Agreement. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, paying principal and interest on our long-term debt, and paying declared dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We believe future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating, investing and dividend cash needs for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, existing cash balances and availability of additional borrowings under the New Credit Agreement provide additional sources of liquidity should they be required.\nOperating Activities. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $81.0 million. This primarily reflects net income of $49.4 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $41.2 million, non-cash impairment charges of $8.9 million, amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs of $6.0 million, a decrease in income taxes receivable of $4.1 million, share-based compensation expense of $3.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $3.9 and an increase in accrued salaries and benefits of $3.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $25.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $13.9 million, and a decrease in closure and post-closure obligations of $1.8 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The increase in receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of customer payments. Changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments. Changes in deferred income taxes are primarily attributable to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the provisions of the Tax Act.\nDays sales outstanding were 77 days as of December 31, 2017, compared to 73 days as of December 31, 2016.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $74.6 million. This primarily reflects net income of $34.3 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $39.8 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $10.9 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.9 million, non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.0 million, and a decrease in other assets of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.7 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $2.7 million, the gain recognized on the divestiture of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016, final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture of $2.0 million, and an increase in income taxes receivable of $2.0 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The decrease in receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of customer payments. Changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $71.5 million. This primarily reflects net income of $25.6 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $44.8 million, non-cash impairment charges of $6.7 million, a decrease in income taxes receivable of $4.8 million, non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.4 million, unrealized foreign currency losses of $3.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.5 million, a decrease in closure and post-closure obligations of $5.7 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $4.4 million, a decrease in income taxes payable of $3.9 million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of $2.7 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The decrease in receivables and deferred revenue is primarily attributable to the timing of the treatment and disposal of waste associated with a significant East Coast remedial cleanup project. The changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily\nattributable to the timing of income tax payments. The decrease in closure and post-closure obligations is primarily attributable to payments made for closure and post-closure activities primarily at our closed landfills.\nInvesting Activities. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $35.3 million, primarily related to capital expenditures. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Beatty, Nevada and Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada locations and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at our corporate and operating facilities.\nIn 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $42.0 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $35.7 million, the purchase of the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC for $5.0 million and the purchase of Environmental Services Inc., ( ESI\u201d), for $4.9 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of our Augusta, Georgia facility for $2.7 million, net of cash divested. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, Beatty, Nevada and Robstown, Texas facilities and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at our corporate and operating facilities.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $20.3 million, primarily related to the divestiture of Allstate for $58.7 million, net of cash divested, partially offset by capital expenditures of $39.4 million. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and Robstown, Texas locations and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at all of our corporate and operating facilities.\nFinancing Activities. During 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $26.3 million, consisting primarily of $283.0 million of repayment of the Company's long-term debt under the Former Credit Agreement, $281.0 million of initial proceeds from the borrowing of long-term debt under the New Credit Agreement, $4.0 million of subsequent repayments of long-term debt under the New Credit Agreement, $15.7 million of dividend payments to our stockholders, $3.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the New Credit Agreement and net payment activity on the Company's short-term borrowings of $2.2 million.\nDuring 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $31.6 million, consisting primarily of $18.0 million of payments on our Term Loan and $15.7 million of dividend payments to our stockholders, partially offset by $2.2 million of net proceeds on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund working capital requirements.\nDuring 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $108.4 million, consisting primarily of $94.6 million of payments on our Term Loan and $15.6 million of dividend payments to our stockholders.\nCredit Facility\nOn April 18, 2017, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders, swingline lender and issuing lender, and Bank of America, N.A., as an issuing lender, which provides for a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), including a $75.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of swingline loans used to fund short-term working capital requirements. The New Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature whereby the Company may request up to $200.0 million of additional funds through an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility, through incremental term loans, or some combination thereof. Proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility are restricted solely for working capital and other general corporate purposes (including acquisitions and capital expenditures). Under the Revolving Credit Facility, revolving credit loans are available based on a base rate (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the Company's option, plus an applicable margin which is determined according to a pricing grid under which the interest rate decreases or increases based on our ratio of funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The Company wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the Former Credit Agreement that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the effective interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility, including the impact of our interest rate\nswap, was 3.39%. Interest only payments are due either quarterly or on the last day of any interest period, as applicable. In October 2014, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixing the interest rate on $190.0 million, or 69%, of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings as of December 31, 2017. The interest rate swap agreement continued to be effective following the termination of the Former Credit Agreement.\nThe Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.175% to 0.35% on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, with such commitment fee to be reduced based upon the Company's total net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The maximum letter of credit capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is $75.0 million and the New Credit Agreement provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, there were $277.0 million of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. These borrowings are due on the revolving credit maturity date (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) and presented as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company has entered into a sweep arrangement whereby day-to-day cash requirements in excess of available cash balances are advanced to the Company on an as-needed basis with repayments of these advances automatically made from subsequent deposits to our cash operating accounts (the Sweep Arrangement\u201d). Total advances outstanding under the Sweep Arrangement are subject to the $25.0 million swingline loan sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's revolving credit loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are not subject to repayment through the Sweep Arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding subject to the Sweep Arrangement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $216.7 million with $6.3 million of the Revolving Credit Facility issued in the form of standby letters of credit utilized as collateral for closure and post-closure financial assurance and other assurance obligations.\nSee Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's debt.\nContractual Obligations and Guarantees\nContractual Obligations\nUS Ecology's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 become due as follows:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$s in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClosure and post-closure obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n308,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n281,081\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,926\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredit agreement obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n639,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n301,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n283,007\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the purposes of the table above, closure and post-closure obligations are shown on an undiscounted basis and inflated using an estimated annual inflation rate of 2.6%.

The interest expense calculation reflects assumed payments on the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings consistent with the disclosures in footnote (2) above.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGuarantees\nWe enter into a wide range of indemnification arrangements, guarantees and assurances in the ordinary course of business and have evaluated agreements that contain guarantees and indemnification clauses. These include tort indemnities, tax indemnities, indemnities against third-party claims arising out of arrangements to provide services to us and indemnities related to the sale of our securities. We also indemnify individuals made party to any suit or proceeding if that individual was acting as an officer or director of US Ecology or was serving at the request of US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries during their tenure as a director or officer. We also provide guarantees and indemnifications for the benefit of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to satisfy performance obligations, including closure and post-closure financial assurances. It is difficult to quantify the maximum potential liability under these indemnification arrangements; however, we are not currently aware of any material liabilities to the Company or any of its subsidiaries arising from these arrangements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe maintain funded trusts agreements, surety bonds and insurance policies for future closure and post-closure obligations at both current and formerly operated disposal facilities. These funded trust agreements, surety bonds and insurance policies are based on management estimates of future closure and post-closure monitoring using engineering evaluations and interpretations of regulatory requirements which are periodically updated. Accounting for closure and post-closure costs includes final disposal cell capping and revegetation, soil and groundwater monitoring and routine maintenance and surveillance required after a site is closed.\nWe estimate that our undiscounted future closure and post-closure costs for all facilities was approximately $308.5 million at December 31, 2017, with a median payment year of 2061. Our future closure and post-closure estimates are our best estimate of current costs and are updated periodically to reflect current technology, cost of materials and services, applicable laws, regulations, permit conditions or orders and other factors. These current costs are adjusted for anticipated annual inflation, which we assumed to be 2.6% as of December 31, 2017. These future closure and post-closure estimates are discounted to their present value for financial reporting purposes using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, which approximates our incremental long-term borrowing rate in effect at the time the obligation is established or when there are upward revisions to our estimated closure and post-closure costs. At December 31, 2017, our weighted-average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate was 5.9%. For financial reporting purposes, our recorded closure and post-closure obligations were $76.1 million and $75.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThrough December 31, 2017, we have met our financial assurance requirements through insurance, surety bonds, standby letters of credit and self-funded restricted trusts.\nU.S. Operating and Non-Operating Facilities\nWe cover our closure and post-closure obligations for our U.S. operating facilities through the use of third-party insurance policies, surety bonds and standby letters of credit. Insurance policies covering our closure and post-closure obligations expire in April 2018 and December 2018. Our total policy limits are approximately $87.4 million. At December 31, 2017 our trust accounts had $5.8 million for our closure and post-closure obligations and are identified as Restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAll closure and post-closure funding obligations for our Beatty, Nevada and Richland, Washington facilities revert to the respective State. Volume based fees are collected from our customers and remitted to state controlled trust funds to cover the estimated cost of closure and post-closure obligations.\nStablex\nWe use commercial surety bonds to cover our closure obligations for our Stablex facility located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Our lease agreement with the Province of Qu\u00e9bec requires that the surety bond be maintained for 25 years after\nthe lease expires in 2023. At December 31, 2017 we had $752,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations. These bonds were renewed in November and December 2017 and expire in November and December 2018. Post-closure funding obligations for the Stablex landfill revert back to the Province of Qu\u00e9bec through a dedicated trust account that is funded based on a per-metric-ton disposed fee by Stablex.\nWe expect to renew insurance policies and commercial surety bonds in the future. If we are unable to obtain adequate closure, post-closure or environmental liability insurance and/or commercial surety bonds in future years, any partial or completely uninsured claim against us, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, continued access to casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits, at acceptable terms, is important to obtaining new business. Failure to maintain adequate financial assurance could also result in regulatory action including early closure of facilities. While we believe we will be able to maintain the requisite financial assurance policies at a reasonable cost, premium and collateral requirements may materially increase.\nOperation of disposal facilities creates operational, closure and post-closure obligations that could result in unplanned monitoring and corrective action costs. We cannot predict the likelihood or effect of all such costs, new laws or regulations, litigation or other future events affecting our facilities. We do not believe that continuing to satisfy our environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nSeasonal Effects\nSeasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles can influence the timing of customer spending for our services. Typically, in the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for our services due to reduced construction and business activities related to weather while we experience improvement in our second and third quarters of each calendar year as weather conditions and other business activity improves.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates included in our critical accounting policies discussed below and those accounting policies and use of estimates discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions and other factors we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We make adjustments to judgments and estimates based on current facts and circumstances on an ongoing basis. Historically, actual results have not deviated significantly from those determined using the estimates described below or in Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, actual amounts could differ materially from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and disposal have occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from three primary sources: 1) waste treatment, recycling and disposal, 2) field and industrial waste management services and 3) waste transportation services.\nWaste treatment and disposal revenue results primarily from fees charged to customers for treatment and/or disposal or recycling of specified wastes. Waste treatment and disposal revenue is generally charged on a per-ton or per-yard basis based on contracted prices and is recognized when services are complete.\nField and industrial waste management services revenue results primarily from specialty onsite services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, and other government, commercial and industrial facilities. These services are provided based on purchase orders or agreements with the customer and include prices based upon daily, hourly or job rates for equipment, materials and personnel. Revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized on contracts with retainage when services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.\nTransportation revenue results from delivering customer waste to a disposal facility for treatment and/or disposal or recycling. Transportation services are generally not provided on a stand-alone basis and instead are bundled with other Company services. However, in some instances we provide transportation and logistics services for shipment of waste from cleanup sites to disposal facilities operated by other companies. We account for our bundled arrangements as multiple deliverable arrangements and determine the amount of revenue recognized for each deliverable (unit of accounting) using the relative fair value method. Transportation revenue is recognized when the transported waste is received at the disposal facility. Waste treatment and disposal revenue under bundled arrangements is recognized when services are complete and the waste is disposed in the landfill.\nBurial fees collected from customers for each ton or cubic yard of waste disposed in our landfills are paid to the respective local and/or state government entity and are not included in revenue. Revenue and associated costs from waste that has been received but not yet treated and disposed of in our landfills are deferred until disposal occurs.\nOur Richland, Washington disposal facility is regulated by the WUTC, which approves our rates for disposal of LLRW. Annual revenue levels are established based on a six-year rate agreement with the WUTC at amounts sufficient to cover the costs of operation and provide us with a reasonable profit. Per-unit rates charged to LLRW customers during the year are based on our evaluation of disposal volume and radioactivity projections submitted to us by waste generators. Our proposed rates are then reviewed and approved by the WUTC. If annual revenue exceeds the approved levels set by the WUTC, we are required to refund excess collections to facility users on a pro-rata basis. The current rate agreement with the WUTC was extended in 2013 and is effective until January 1, 2020.\nDisposal Facility Accounting\nWe amortize landfill and disposal assets and certain related permits over their estimated useful lives. The units-of-consumption method is used to amortize landfill cell construction and development costs and asset retirement costs. Under the units-of-consumption method, we include costs incurred to date as well as future estimated construction costs in the amortization base of the landfill assets. Additionally, where appropriate, as discussed below, we also include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill asset. If we determine that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the total remaining useful life of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense over the remaining estimated useful life of the landfill asset. If at any time we make the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort would be expensed in the period of abandonment.\nOur landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which require accounting judgments and estimates:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLandfill assets comprised of capitalized landfill development costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDisposal facility retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities that result in corresponding retirement assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLandfill Assets\nLandfill assets include the costs of landfill site acquisition, permits and cell design and construction incurred to date. Landfill cells represent individual disposal areas within the overall treatment and disposal site and may be subject to specific permit requirements in addition to the general permit requirements associated with the overall site.\nTo develop, construct and operate a landfill cell, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the landfill cell will be permitted.\nUpon receipt of regulatory approval, technical landfill cell designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill cell including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill cell.\nThe types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates at least annually. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill cell, including personnel costs of employees directly associated with the landfill cell design, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.\nTo match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill asset on a units-of-consumption basis over its operating life, typically on a cubic yard or cubic meter of disposal space consumed. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill cell's operating life. The per-unit amortization rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill cell, by the landfill cell's estimated remaining disposal capacity. Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill cell, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and valued them at the time of acquisition based on fair value.\nIncluded in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill cell. These factors include the area over which the landfill cell will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill cell elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. Landfill cell capacity used in the determination of amortization rates of our landfill assets includes both permitted and unpermitted disposal capacity. Unpermitted disposal capacity is included when management believes achieving final regulatory approval is probable based on our analysis of site conditions and interactions with applicable regulatory agencies.\nWe review the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill cell at least annually. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are developed using input from independent engineers and internal technical and accounting managers and are reviewed and approved by our environmental management group. Any changes in future estimated costs or estimated disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill cell amortization rates.\nWe assess our long-lived landfill assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate impairment of any of our landfill assets include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in legislative or regulatory requirements impacting the landfill site permitting process making it more difficult and costly to obtain and/or maintain a landfill permit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nActions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits, which could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit and adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of, or abandon, a project, which could result in an asset impairment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnexpected significant increases in estimated costs, significant reductions in prices we are able to charge our customers or reductions in disposal capacity that affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDisposal Facility Retirement Obligations\nDisposal facility retirement obligations include the cost to close, maintain and monitor landfill cells and support facilities. As individual landfill cells reach capacity, we must cap and close the cells in accordance with the landfill cell permits. These capping and closure requirements are detailed in the technical design of each landfill cell and included as part of our approved regulatory permit. After the entire landfill cell has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the landfill cell for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the landfill cell and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the landfill cell has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, transportation and disposal of landfill leachate, and erosion control costs related to the final cap.\nWe have a legally enforceable obligation to operate our landfill cells in accordance with the specific requirements, regulations and criteria set forth in our permits. This includes executing the approved closure/post-closure plan and closing/capping the entire landfill cell in accordance with the established requirements, design and criteria contained in the permit. As a result, we record the fair value of our disposal facility retirement obligations as a liability in the period in which the regulatory obligation to retire a specific asset is triggered. For our individual landfill cells, the required closure and post-closure obligations under the terms of our permits and our intended operation of the landfill cell are triggered and recorded when the cell is placed into service and waste is initially disposed in the landfill cell. The fair value is based on the total estimated costs to close the landfill cell and perform post-closure activities once the landfill cell has reached capacity and is no longer accepting waste, discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that is used to calculate the recorded liability, with accretion charged to direct operating costs. Actual cash expenditures to perform closure and post-closure activities reduce the retirement obligation liabilities as incurred. After initial measurement, asset retirement obligations are adjusted at the end of each period to reflect changes, if any, in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. Disposal facility retirement assets are capitalized as the related disposal facility retirement obligations are incurred. Disposal facility retirement assets are amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as the disposal capacity is consumed.\nOur disposal facility retirement obligations represent the present value of current cost estimates to close, maintain and monitor landfills and support facilities as described above. Cost estimates are developed using input from independent engineers, internal technical and accounting managers, as well as our environmental management group's interpretation of current legal and regulatory requirements, and are intended to approximate fair value. We estimate the timing of future payments based on expected annual disposal airspace consumption and then inflate the current cost estimate by an inflation rate, estimated at December 31, 2017 to be 2.6%. Inflated current costs are then discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, which approximates our incremental borrowing rate in effect at the time the obligation is established or when there are upward revisions to our estimated closure and post-closure costs. Our weighted-average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate at December 31, 2017 was approximately 5.9%. Final closure and post-closure obligations are currently estimated as being paid through the year 2105. During 2017 we updated several assumptions, including estimated costs and timing of closing our disposal cells. These updates resulted in a net decrease to our post-closure obligations of $352,000.\nWe update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill cell on an annual basis. Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of the required future activities to close, maintain and monitor landfills and facilities result in both: (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and\nrelated asset and (ii) a change in accretion and amortization rates which are applied prospectively over the remaining life of the asset. A hypothetical 1% increase in the inflation rate would increase our closure/post-closure obligation by $16.9 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in our cost estimates would increase our closure/post-closure obligation by $7.6 million.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's goodwill balance was $189.4 million. We assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter as of October 1 of each year, and also if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The assessment consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, including goodwill. Some of the factors that could indicate impairment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or failure to generate sufficient cash flows at the reporting unit. For example, field and industrial services represents an emerging business for the Company and has been the focus of a shift in strategy since the acquisition of EQ. Failure to execute on planned growth initiatives within this business could lead to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in future periods.\nWe determine our reporting units by identifying the components of each operating segment, and then aggregate components having similar economic characteristics based on quantitative and/or qualitative factors. At December 31, 2017, we had 14 reporting units, 8 of which had allocated goodwill.\nFair values are generally determined by using a market approach, applying a multiple of earnings based on guideline for publicly traded companies, an income approach, discounting projected future cash flows based on our expectations of the current and future operating environment, or a combination thereof. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. The rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry, capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired, and an impairment charge would be recognized during the period in which the determination has been made for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe result of the annual assessment of goodwill undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value, with the exception of the Resource Recovery reporting unit.\nOur Resource Recovery reporting unit offers full-service storm water management and propylene glycol ( PG\u201d) deicing fluid recovery at major airports. Recovered fluids are transported to our recycling facility in Romulus, Michigan where they are distilled and resold to industrial users. The Resource Recovery reporting unit also generates revenues from brokered PG sales and services revenues for PG collection at the airports we service. Weak PG commodity prices and reduced PG collection volumes at the airports we service negatively impacted the reporting unit's prospective financial information in its discounted cash flow model and the reporting unit's estimated fair value. A longer-than-expected recovery in PG commodity pricing and PG collection volumes became evident during the fourth quarter of 2017 as management completed its 2018 budgeting cycle and updated the long-term projections for the reporting unit which, as a result, decreased the reporting unit's anticipated future cash flows as compared to those estimated previously.\nThe estimated fair value of the Resource Recovery reporting unit was determined under an income approach using discounted projected future cash flows and then compared to the reporting unit's carrying amount as of October 1, 2017. Based on the results of that comparison, the carrying amount of the Resource Recovery reporting unit, including $5.5 million of goodwill, exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by more than $5.5 million and, as a result, we recognized a $5.5 million impairment charge, representing the reporting unit's entire goodwill balance, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe review intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment during the fourth quarter as of October 1 of each year. Fair value is generally determined by considering an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period in which the annual assessment occurs.\nThe result of the annual assessment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated no impairment charges were required, with the exception of the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit associated with our Resource Recovery business.\nIn performing the annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test, the estimated fair value of the Resource Recovery business' waste collection, recycling and resale permit was determined under an income approach using discounted projected future cash flows associated with the permit and then compared to the $3.7 million carrying amount of the permit as of October 1, 2017. Based on the results of that evaluation, the carrying amount of the permit exceeded the estimated fair value of the permit and, as a result, we recognized a $3.4 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. The factors and timing contributing to the nonamortizing permit impairment charge were the same as the factors and timing described above with regards to the Resource Recovery reporting unit goodwill impairment charge.\nWe also review finite-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the assets' carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering: (i) the internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis; (ii) a third-party valuation; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period in which the events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable occurred.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed an assessment of the Resource Recovery business' finite-lived tangible and intangible assets, as events indicated their carrying values may not be recoverable. The result of the assessment indicated no impairment charges were required. Otherwise, no events or circumstances occurred during 2017 that would indicate that our finite-lived tangible and intangible assets may be impaired, therefore no other impairment tests were performed during 2017 other than the annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives conducted in the fourth quarter of every year.\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Allstate to a private investor group. Allstate represents the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this agreement and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Our interim goodwill impairment test which included both Step I and Step II analysis was performed and resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million being recognized in the second quarter of 2015. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nOur acquired permits and licenses generally have renewal terms of approximately 5-10 years. We have a history of renewing these permits and licenses as demonstrated by the fact that each of the sites' treatment permits and licenses have been renewed regularly since the facility began operations. We intend to continue to renew our permits and licenses as they come up for renewal for the foreseeable future. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of our permits and licenses are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare Based Payments\nOn May 27, 2015, our stockholders approved the Omnibus Incentive Plan ( Omnibus Plan\u201d), which was approved by our Board of Directors on April 7, 2015. The Omnibus Plan was developed to provide additional incentives through equity ownership in US Ecology and, as a result, encourage employees and directors to contribute to our success. The Omnibus Plan provides, among other things, the ability for the Company to grant restricted stock, performance stock, options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units ( PSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards or cash awards to officers, employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Subsequent to the approval of the Omnibus Plan in May 2015, we stopped granting equity awards under our 2008 Stock Option Incentive Plan and our 2006 Restricted Stock Plan ( Previous Plans\u201d), and the Previous Plans will remain in effect solely for the settlement of awards granted under the Previous Plans. No shares that are reserved but unissued under the Previous Plans or that are outstanding under the Previous Plans and reacquired by the Company for any reason will be available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. The Omnibus Plan expires on April 7, 2025 and authorizes 1,500,000 shares of common stock for grant over the life of the Omnibus Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have PSUs outstanding under the Omnibus Plan. Each PSU represents the right to receive, on the settlement date, one share of the Company's common stock. The total number of PSUs each participant is eligible to earn ranges from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs granted. The actual number of PSUs that will vest and be settled in shares is determined at the end of a three-year performance period, based on total stockholder return relative to a set of peer companies and the S&P 600. The fair value of the PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation of awards granted during 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have stock option awards outstanding under the 1992 Stock Option Plan for Employees ( 1992 Employee Plan\u201d) and the 2008 Stock Option Incentive Plan ( 2008 Stock Option Plan\u201d). Subsequent to the approval of the Omnibus Plan in May 2015, we stopped granting equity awards under the 2008 Stock Option Plan. The 2008 Stock Option Plan will remain in effect solely for the settlement of awards previously granted. In April 2013, the 1992 Employee Plan expired and was cancelled except for options then outstanding.\nThe determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected term of stock options and expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions utilized in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nThe Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach whereby we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for the likelihood of use in future periods. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance, if any, requires our judgment and the use of estimates. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we have deferred tax assets totaling approximately $15.9 million, a valuation allowance of $2.2 million and deferred tax liabilities totaling approximately $71.2 million.\nThe application of income tax law is inherently complex. Tax laws and regulations are voluminous and at times ambiguous and interpretations of guidance regarding such tax laws and regulations change over time. This requires us to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. A liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded in our financial statements on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position taken will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. As facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We recognize interest assessed by taxing authorities or interest associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense. We recognize any penalties assessed by taxing authorities or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company has calculated a provisional amount of the impact of the Tax Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and as a result has recorded $23.8 million as a net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional benefit amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was $25.2 million. The provisional expense amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $1.4 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $26.7 million.\nIn connection with the Tax Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined that the $25.2 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $1.4 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional amounts estimated based on information available as of December 31, 2017. These amounts are subject to change as we obtain information necessary to complete the calculations. Any subsequent adjustment to these provisional amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in 2018, when the analysis is complete. We expect to complete our analysis of the provisional items during the second half of 2018. The effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are being analyzed and are subject to change as additional information, guidance, and regulation becomes available.\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.\nLitigation\nWe have, in the past, been involved in litigation requiring estimates of timing and loss potential whose timing and ultimate disposition is controlled by the judicial process. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any ongoing, pending or threatened legal action that management believes, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The decision to accrue costs or write off assets is based on the pertinent facts and our evaluation of present circumstances.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or interests in variable interest entities that would require consolidation. US Ecology operates through wholly-owned subsidiaries.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nUS Ecology, Inc. is a leading North American provider of environmental services to commercial and government entities. The Company addresses the complex waste management needs of its customers, offering treatment, disposal and recycling of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste, as well as a wide range of complementary field and industrial services. US Ecology's comprehensive knowledge of the waste business, its collection of waste management facilities and focus on safety, environmental compliance, and customer service enables us to effectively meet the needs of our customers and to build long-lasting relationships.\nWe have fixed facilities and service centers operating in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our fixed facilities include five RCRA subtitle C hazardous waste landfills and one LLRW landfill located near Beatty, Nevada; Richland, Washington; Robstown, Texas; Grand View, Idaho; Detroit, Michigan and Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. These facilities\ngenerate revenue from fees charged to treat and dispose of waste and from fees charged to perform various field and industrial services for our customers.\nOn November 1, 2015, we sold our Allstate Power Vac, Inc. ( Allstate\u201d) subsidiary to a private investor group. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur operations are managed in two reportable segments reflecting our internal management reporting structure and nature of services offered as follows:\nEnvironmental Services-This segment provides a broad range of hazardous material management services including transportation, recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at Company-owned landfill, wastewater and other treatment facilities.\nField & Industrial Services-This segment provides packaging and collection of hazardous waste and total waste management solutions at customer sites and through our 10-day transfer facilities. Services include on-site management, waste characterization, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. This segment also provides specialty services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response and other services to commercial and industrial facilities and to government entities.\nIn order to provide insight into the underlying drivers of our waste volumes and related treatment and disposal ( T&D\u201d) revenues, we evaluate period-to-period changes in our T&D revenue for our Environmental Services segment based on the industry of the waste generator, based on North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS\u201d) codes.\nThe composition of the Environmental Services segment T&D revenues by waste generator industry for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Treatment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand Disposal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfor the Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnded\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGenerator Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChemical Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMetal Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBroker / TSDF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRefining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGovernment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMining, Exploration and Production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWaste Management & Remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes all transportation service revenue \n (2) Includes retail and wholesale trade, rate regulated, construction and other industries \nWe also categorize our Environmental Services T&D revenue as either Base Business\u201d or Event Business\u201d based on the underlying nature of the revenue source.\nBase Business consists of waste streams from ongoing industrial activities and tends to be reoccurring in nature. We define Event Business as non-recurring projects that are expected to equal or exceed 1,000 tons, with Base Business defined as all other business not meeting the definition of Event Business. The duration of Event Business projects can last from a several-week cleanup of a contaminated site to a multiple year cleanup project.\nDuring 2017, Base Business revenue growth was up 5% compared to 2016. Base Business revenue was approximately 78% of total 2017 T&D revenue, down from 82% in 2016. Our business is highly competitive and no assurance can be given that we will maintain these revenue levels or increase our market share.\nA significant portion of our disposal revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business projects which vary widely in size, duration and unit pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 22% of our T&D revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event Business, diverse spectrum of waste types received and widely varying unit pricing necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability may be influenced by general and industry-specific economic conditions, funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions or court orders, public controversy, litigation, weather, commercial real estate, closed military bases and other project timing, government appropriation and funding cycles and other factors. The types and amounts of waste received from Base Business also vary from quarter to quarter.\nThis variability can also cause significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year differences in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and net income. While we pursue many projects months or years in advance of work performance, cleanup project opportunities routinely arise with little or no prior notice. These market dynamics are inherent to the waste disposal business and are factored into our projections and externally communicated business outlook statements. Our projections combine historical experience with identified sales pipeline opportunities, new or expanded service line projections and prevailing market conditions.\nDepending on project-specific customer needs and competitive economics, transportation services may be offered at or near our cost to help secure new business. For waste transported by rail from the eastern United States and other locations distant from our Grand View, Idaho and Robstown, Texas facilities, transportation-related revenue can account for as much as 75% of total project revenue. While bundling transportation and disposal services reduces overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenue ( gross margin\u201d), this value-added service has allowed us to win multiple projects that management believes we could not have otherwise competed for successfully. Our Company-owned fleet of gondola railcars, which is periodically supplemented with railcars obtained under operating leases, has reduced our transportation expenses by largely eliminating reliance on more costly short-term rentals. These Company-owned railcars also help us to win business during times of demand-driven railcar scarcity.\nThe increased waste volumes resulting from projects won through this bundled service strategy further drive operating leverage benefits inherent to the disposal business, increasing profitability. While waste treatment and other variable costs are project-specific, the incremental earnings contribution from large and small projects generally increases as overall disposal volumes increase. Based on past experience, management believes that maximizing operating income, net income and earnings per share is a higher priority than maintaining or increasing gross margin. We intend to continue aggressively bidding bundled transportation and disposal services based on this proven strategy.\nWe serve oil refineries, chemical production plants, steel mills, waste brokers/aggregators serving small manufacturers and other industrial customers that are generally affected by the prevailing economic conditions and credit environment. Adverse conditions may cause our customers as well as those they serve to curtail operations, resulting in lower waste production and/or delayed spending on off-site waste shipments, maintenance, waste cleanup projects and other work. Factors that can impact general economic conditions and the level of spending by customers include, but are not limited to, consumer and industrial spending, increases in fuel and energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other global economic factors affecting spending behavior. Market forces may also induce customers to reduce or cease operations, declare bankruptcy, liquidate or relocate to other countries, any of which could adversely affect our business. To the extent business is either government funded or driven by government regulations or enforcement actions, we believe it is less susceptible to general economic conditions. Spending by government agencies may be reduced due to declining tax revenues resulting from a weak economy or changes in policy. Disbursement of funds appropriated by Congress may also be delayed for various reasons.\nOur results of operations have been affected by certain significant events during the past three fiscal years including, but not limited to:\n2017 Events\nGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Asset Impairment Charges: Based on the results of the Company's annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, during the fourth quarter we recorded a $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge in our Resource Recovery reporting unit and a $3.4 million impairment charge on the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit associated with our Resource Recovery business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company calculated a provisional amount of the impact of the Tax Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as a result, recorded a $23.8 million net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWrite-off of Deferred Financing Costs: In connection with the refinancing of the Company's outstanding debt, we wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n2016 Events\nDivestiture of Augusta, Georgia Facility: On April 5, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our Augusta, Georgia facility for cash proceeds of $1.9 million. The Augusta, Georgia facility was reported as part of our Environmental Services segment. Sales, net income and total assets of the Augusta, Georgia facility are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations in any period presented. We recognized a $1.9 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of the Augusta, Georgia facility, which is included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition of Environmental Services Inc.: On May 2, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Environmental Services Inc., ( ESI\u201d), an environmental services company based in Tilbury, Ontario, Canada. The total purchase price was $4.9 million, net of cash acquired, and was funded with cash on hand. Revenues and total assets of ESI are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We recorded $1.5 million of intangible assets and $1.0 million of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the acquisition. Definite-lived intangibles will be amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 14 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually.\nAcquisition of Vernon, California Facility: On October 1, 2016, the Company acquired the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC. The total purchase price was $5.0 million and was funded with cash on hand. Revenues and total assets of the Vernon, California facility are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We recorded $3.2 million of intangible assets and $354,000 of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the acquisition. Definite-lived intangibles will be amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 20 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually.\n2015 Events\nSale of Allstate Power Vac, Inc. ( Allstate\u201d) and Goodwill Impairment: On November 1, 2015, we sold our Allstate subsidiary to a private investor group for cash proceeds of $58.8 million. Allstate represented the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this divestiture and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Based on this analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015. We recognized a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Allstate, including transaction-related costs, of $542,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we received additional cash proceeds of $827,000 in settlement of final post-closing adjustments and recognized an additional $178,000 pre-tax gain. Gains and losses related to the sale of Allstate are included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. Cash proceeds from the transaction were used to repay debt. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results and percentage of

Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and \n \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. \n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased 6% to $504.0 million in 2017, compared with $477.7 million in 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment revenue increased 8% to $366.3 million in 2017, compared to $337.8 million in 2016. T&D revenue increased 8% in 2017, primarily as a result of a 23% increase in project-based Event Business revenue and a 5% increase in Base Business revenue. Transportation and logistics service revenue increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting more Event Business projects utilizing the Company's transportation and logistics services. Tons of waste disposed of or processed increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nT&D revenue from recurring Base Business waste generators increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 and comprised 78% of total T&D revenue. During 2017, increases in Base Business T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, refining, general manufacturing, and Other\u201d industry groups were partially offset by decreases in T&D revenue from Base Business in the broker/TSDF industry group.\nT&D revenue from Event Business waste generators increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016 and comprised 22% of total T&D revenue. The increase in Event Business T&D revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects higher T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, metal manufacturing, government and Other\u201d industry groups, partially offset by lower T&D revenue from the general manufacturing industry group. The increase in revenue from the chemical manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to a large East Coast remedial cleanup project. The decrease in revenue from the general manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to lower Event Business volume.\nThe following table summarizes combined Base Business and Event Business T&D revenue growth, within the Environmental Services segment, by waste generator industry for 2017 compared to 2016:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nT&D Revenue Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChemical Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWaste Management & Remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGovernment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMining and E&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRefining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMetal Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBroker / TSDF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment revenue decreased 2% to $137.7 million in 2017 compared with $139.9 million in 2016. The decrease in Field & Industrial Services segment revenue is primarily attributable to the expiration of a contract that was not renewed or replaced and softer overall market conditions for industrial and remediation services.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit increased 4% to $153.1 million in 2017, up from $147.6 million in 2016. Total gross margin was 30% for 2017 compared with 31% for 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment gross profit increased 6% to $135.0 million in 2017, up from $126.8 million in 2016. This increase primarily reflects higher T&D volumes in 2017 compared to 2016. Total segment gross margin was 37% for 2017 compared with 38% for 2016. T&D gross margin was 40% for 2017 compared with 42% for 2016. The decrease in T&D gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of the temporary closure of one of our treatment facilities due to wind damage and incremental costs associated with the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and Florida that impacted our operations in 2017.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment gross profit decreased 13% to $18.2 million in 2017, down from $20.8 million in 2016. Total segment gross margin was 13% for 2017 compared with 15% for 2016. The decrease in segment gross margin is attributable to lower route density in our small quantity generation services due to a contract that was not renewed in late 2016 and a less favorable service mix for our industrial and remediation services in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTotal SG&A increased to $84.5 million, or 17% of total revenue, in 2017 compared with $77.6 million, or 16% of total revenue, in 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment SG&A increased 13% to $24.2 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2017 compared with $21.4 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2016, primarily reflecting higher labor and incentive compensation costs, higher property tax expenses and lower gains on sale of assets, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and higher insurance proceeds in 2017 compared to 2016.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment SG&A decreased 8% to $9.3 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2017 compared with $10.1 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2016. The decrease in segment SG&A primarily reflects lower bad debt expense and higher insurance proceeds, partially offset by higher labor and incentive compensation costs in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A was $51.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2017 compared with $46.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2016, primarily reflecting higher labor and incentive compensation costs in 2017 compared to 2016.\nComponents of Adjusted EBITDA\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate for 2017 was -14.9% compared to 38.1% in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 by the U.S. government. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and imposes a deemed repatriation tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. We re-measured our net deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a provisional benefit of $25.2 million to our income tax expense. We also recorded a provisional charge of $1.4 million to our income tax expense for the deemed repatriation transition tax. While we are able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d), and actions we may take. We are continuing to gather additional\ninformation to determine the final impact. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was also attributable to a higher proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2017 which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by non-recurring non-deductible impairment charges as well as a higher effective state tax rate driven by changes in apportionment of income between the various states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2017, we have exhausted all of our federal net operating loss carry forwards ( NOLs\u201d) and have approximately $8.9 million in state and local NOLs for which we maintain a substantial valuation allowance. We maintain a valuation allowance on state and local NOLs when we no longer do business within a state or locality or determine it is unlikely that we will utilize these NOLs in the future. We consider it more likely than not that we will not utilize the majority of these NOLs in the future.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $18.2 million in 2017 compared with $17.3 million in 2016. The Company wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the Former Credit Agreement that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time non-cash charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017. This increase is partially offset by a lower effective interest rate under the New Credit Agreement compared to the Former Credit Agreement and reduced debt levels in 2017 compared to 2016.\nForeign currency gain (loss)\nWe recognized a $516,000 non-cash foreign currency gain in 2017 compared with a $138,000 non-cash foreign currency loss in 2016. Foreign currency gains and losses reflect changes in business activity conducted in a currency other than the USD, our functional currency. Our Canadian subsidiaries' facilities are located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec and Tilbury, Ontario, Canada and use the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) as their functional currency. Additionally, we established intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the CAD, and our parent company, US Ecology, as part of a tax and treasury management strategy allowing for repayment of third-party bank debt. These intercompany loans are payable by our Canadian subsidiaries to US Ecology in CAD requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our statements of operations based on USD/CAD currency movements from period to period. At December 31, 2017, we had $21.4 million of intercompany loans subject to currency revaluation.\nGain on divestiture\nOther income in 2016 includes approximately $2.0 million related to the gain on sale of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016 and final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture.\nDepreciation and amortization of plant and equipment\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $28.3 million in 2017 compared with $25.3 million in 2016, primarily reflecting additional depreciation expense on assets placed in service in 2017.\nAmortization of intangibles\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $9.9 million in 2017 compared with $10.6 million in 2016.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense increased 34% to $3.9 million in 2017, compared with $2.9 million 2016 as a result of an increase in equity-based awards granted to employees.\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities decreased to $3.0 million in 2017 compared with $4.0 million in 2016, primarily reflecting non-cash adjustments to post-closure liabilities recorded in 2017 due to changes in cost estimates associated with closed sites.\nImpairment charges\nBased on the results of our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we recorded a $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge in our Resource Recovery reporting unit and a $3.4 million impairment charge on the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit of our Resource Recovery business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue\nTotal revenue decreased 15% to $477.7 million in 2016, compared with $563.1 million in 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment revenue decreased 6% to $337.8 million in 2016, compared to $359.0 million in 2015. T&D revenue decreased 5% in 2016, primarily as a result of a 30% decrease in project-based Event Business. Transportation and logistics service revenue decreased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting fewer Event Business projects utilizing the Company's transportation and logistics services. Tons of waste disposed of or processed decreased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015.\nT&D revenue from recurring Base Business waste generators increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015 and comprised 82% of total T&D revenue. During 2016, increases in Base Business T&D revenue from the refining, Other\u201d, utilities and general manufacturing industry groups were partially offset by decreases in T&D revenue from Base Business in the chemical manufacturing and broker/TSDF industry groups.\nT&D revenue from Event Business waste generators decreased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015 and comprised 18% of total T&D revenue. The decrease in Event Business T&D revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects lower T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, refining and government industry groups, partially offset by higher T&D revenue from the general manufacturing and Other\u201d industry groups. The decrease in revenue from the chemical manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to the completion of a large East Coast remedial cleanup project in the third quarter of 2015 and the completion of a nuclear fuels fabrication plant decommissioning in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue from the refining and government industry groups is primarily attributable to lower Event Business volumes.\nThe following table summarizes combined Base Business and Event Business T&D revenue growth, within the Environmental Services segment, by waste generator industry for 2016 compared to 2015:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nT&D Revenue Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWaste Management & Remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRefining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMetal Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBroker / TSDF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMining and E&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGovernment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChemical Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment revenue decreased 31% to $139.9 million in 2016 compared with $204.0 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the divested Allstate business which contributed segment revenue of $59.1 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit decreased 14% to $147.6 million in 2016, down from $171.4 million in 2015. Total gross margin was 31% for 2016 compared with 30% for 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment gross profit decreased 8% to $126.8 million in 2016, down from $137.6 million in 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower T&D volumes in 2016 compared to 2015. Total segment gross margin was 38% for both 2016 and 2015. T&D gross margin was 42% for 2016 compared with 43% for 2015.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment gross profit decreased 38% to $20.8 million in 2016, down from $33.8 million in 2015. Total segment gross margin was 15% for 2016 compared with 17% for 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed segment gross profit of $12.4 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTotal SG&A decreased to $77.6 million, or 16% of total revenue, in 2016 compared with $93.1 million, or 17% of total revenue, in 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment SG&A decreased 6% to $21.4 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2016 compared with $22.8 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2015, primarily reflecting higher gains on sales of assets in 2016 compared to 2015.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment SG&A decreased 54% to $10.1 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2016 compared with $22.0 million, or 11% of segment revenue, in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed segment SG&A of $10.9 million for our period of ownership in 2015. The remaining decrease in segment SG&A primarily reflects lower employee labor costs in 2016 compared to 2015.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A was $46.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2016 compared with $48.4 million, or 9% of total revenue, in 2015, primarily reflecting lower business development expenses and lower professional services expenses in 2016 compared to 2015.\nComponents of Adjusted EBITDA\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate for 2016 was 38.1% compared to 45.3% in 2015. The decrease reflects nonrecurring non-deductible goodwill impairment charges incurred in 2015, a nondeductible loss on the sale of the Allstate business recorded\nduring 2015 and a decrease in our U.S. effective tax rate, driven by a lower overall effective state tax rate. The lower effective state tax rate was driven by changes in apportionment of income and deferred taxes between the various states in which we operate. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a lower proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2016, which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $17,000 in federal NOLs acquired from EQ. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $12.7 million in state and local NOLs for which we maintain a substantial valuation allowance. We maintain a valuation allowance on state and local NOLs when we no longer do business within a state or locality or determine it is unlikely that we will utilize these NOLs in the future. We consider it more likely than not that we will not utilize the majority of these NOLs in the future.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $17.3 million in 2016 compared with $23.4 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to $291,000 of incremental non-cash amortization of deferred financing fees associated with debt principal payments in 2016 compared with $2.4 million of incremental amortization in 2015. The remaining decrease is attributable to lower debt levels in 2016 compared with 2015.\nForeign currency gain (loss)\nWe recognized a $138,000 non-cash foreign currency loss in 2016 compared with a $2.2 million non-cash foreign currency loss in 2015. Foreign currency gains and losses reflect changes in business activity conducted in a currency other than the USD, our functional currency. Our Canadian subsidiaries' facilities are located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec and Tilbury, Ontario, Canada and use the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) as their functional currency. Additionally, we established intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the CAD, and our parent company, US Ecology, as part of a tax and treasury management strategy allowing for repayment of third-party bank debt. These intercompany loans are payable by our Canadian subsidiaries to US Ecology in CAD requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our statements of operations based on USD/CAD currency movements from period to period. At December 31, 2016, we had $20.8 million of intercompany loans subject to currency revaluation.\nGain on divestiture\nOther income in 2016 includes approximately $2.0 million related to the gain on sale of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016 and final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture.\nDepreciation and amortization of plant and equipment\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $25.3 million in 2016 compared with $27.9 million in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed depreciation and amortization expense of $2.2 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nAmortization of intangibles\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $10.6 million in 2016 compared with $12.3 million in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed intangible assets amortization expense of $1.4 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense increased 27% to $2.9 million in 2016, compared with $2.3 million 2015 as a result of an increase in equity-based awards granted to employees.\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities was $4.0 million in 2016 compared with $4.6 million in 2015.\nImpairment charges\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Allstate to a private investor group. Allstate represented the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this agreement and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Based on this analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new senior secured credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d). At December 31, 2017, we had $27.0 million in cash and cash equivalents immediately available and $216.7 million of borrowing capacity available under the New Credit Agreement. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, paying principal and interest on our long-term debt, and paying declared dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We believe future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating, investing and dividend cash needs for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, existing cash balances and availability of additional borrowings under the New Credit Agreement provide additional sources of liquidity should they be required.\nOperating Activities. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $81.0 million. This primarily reflects net income of $49.4 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $41.2 million, non-cash impairment charges of $8.9 million, amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs of $6.0 million, a decrease in income taxes receivable of $4.1 million, share-based compensation expense of $3.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $3.9 and an increase in accrued salaries and benefits of $3.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $25.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $13.9 million, and a decrease in closure and post-closure obligations of $1.8 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The increase in receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of customer payments. Changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments. Changes in deferred income taxes are primarily attributable to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the provisions of the Tax Act.\nDays sales outstanding were 77 days as of December 31, 2017, compared to 73 days as of December 31, 2016.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $74.6 million. This primarily reflects net income of $34.3 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $39.8 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $10.9 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.9 million, non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.0 million, and a decrease in other assets of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.7 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $2.7 million, the gain recognized on the divestiture of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016, final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture of $2.0 million, and an increase in income taxes receivable of $2.0 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The decrease in receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of customer payments. Changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $71.5 million. This primarily reflects net income of $25.6 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $44.8 million, non-cash impairment charges of $6.7 million, a decrease in income taxes receivable of $4.8 million, non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.4 million, unrealized foreign currency losses of $3.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.5 million, a decrease in closure and post-closure obligations of $5.7 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $4.4 million, a decrease in income taxes payable of $3.9 million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of $2.7 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The decrease in receivables and deferred revenue is primarily attributable to the timing of the treatment and disposal of waste associated with a significant East Coast remedial cleanup project. The changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily\nattributable to the timing of income tax payments. The decrease in closure and post-closure obligations is primarily attributable to payments made for closure and post-closure activities primarily at our closed landfills.\nInvesting Activities. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $35.3 million, primarily related to capital expenditures. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Beatty, Nevada and Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada locations and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at our corporate and operating facilities.\nIn 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $42.0 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $35.7 million, the purchase of the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC for $5.0 million and the purchase of Environmental Services Inc., ( ESI\u201d), for $4.9 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of our Augusta, Georgia facility for $2.7 million, net of cash divested. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, Beatty, Nevada and Robstown, Texas facilities and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at our corporate and operating facilities.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $20.3 million, primarily related to the divestiture of Allstate for $58.7 million, net of cash divested, partially offset by capital expenditures of $39.4 million. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and Robstown, Texas locations and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at all of our corporate and operating facilities.\nFinancing Activities. During 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $26.3 million, consisting primarily of $283.0 million of repayment of the Company's long-term debt under the Former Credit Agreement, $281.0 million of initial proceeds from the borrowing of long-term debt under the New Credit Agreement, $4.0 million of subsequent repayments of long-term debt under the New Credit Agreement, $15.7 million of dividend payments to our stockholders, $3.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the New Credit Agreement and net payment activity on the Company's short-term borrowings of $2.2 million.\nDuring 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $31.6 million, consisting primarily of $18.0 million of payments on our Term Loan and $15.7 million of dividend payments to our stockholders, partially offset by $2.2 million of net proceeds on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund working capital requirements.\nDuring 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $108.4 million, consisting primarily of $94.6 million of payments on our Term Loan and $15.6 million of dividend payments to our stockholders.\nCredit Facility\nOn April 18, 2017, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders, swingline lender and issuing lender, and Bank of America, N.A., as an issuing lender, which provides for a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), including a $75.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of swingline loans used to fund short-term working capital requirements. The New Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature whereby the Company may request up to $200.0 million of additional funds through an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility, through incremental term loans, or some combination thereof. Proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility are restricted solely for working capital and other general corporate purposes (including acquisitions and capital expenditures). Under the Revolving Credit Facility, revolving credit loans are available based on a base rate (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the Company's option, plus an applicable margin which is determined according to a pricing grid under which the interest rate decreases or increases based on our ratio of funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The Company wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the Former Credit Agreement that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the effective interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility, including the impact of our interest rate\nswap, was 3.39%. Interest only payments are due either quarterly or on the last day of any interest period, as applicable. In October 2014, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixing the interest rate on $190.0 million, or 69%, of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings as of December 31, 2017. The interest rate swap agreement continued to be effective following the termination of the Former Credit Agreement.\nThe Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.175% to 0.35% on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, with such commitment fee to be reduced based upon the Company's total net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The maximum letter of credit capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is $75.0 million and the New Credit Agreement provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, there were $277.0 million of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. These borrowings are due on the revolving credit maturity date (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) and presented as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company has entered into a sweep arrangement whereby day-to-day cash requirements in excess of available cash balances are advanced to the Company on an as-needed basis with repayments of these advances automatically made from subsequent deposits to our cash operating accounts (the Sweep Arrangement\u201d). Total advances outstanding under the Sweep Arrangement are subject to the $25.0 million swingline loan sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's revolving credit loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are not subject to repayment through the Sweep Arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding subject to the Sweep Arrangement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $216.7 million with $6.3 million of the Revolving Credit Facility issued in the form of standby letters of credit utilized as collateral for closure and post-closure financial assurance and other assurance obligations.\nSee Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's debt.\nContractual Obligations and Guarantees\nContractual Obligations\nUS Ecology's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 become due as follows:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$s in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClosure and post-closure obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n308,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n281,081\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,926\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredit agreement obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n639,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n301,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n283,007\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) For the purposes of the table above, closure and post-closure obligations are shown on an undiscounted basis and inflated using an estimated annual inflation rate of 2.6%. Cash payments for closure and post-closure obligation extend to the year 2105. \n (2) At December 31, 2017, there were $277.0 million of revolving credit loans outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. These revolving credit loans are due upon the earliest to occur of (a) April 18, 2022 (or, with respect to any lender, such later date as requested by us and accepted by such lender), (b) the date of termination of the entire revolving credit commitment (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) by us, and (c) the date of termination of the revolving credit commitment. \n (3) Interest expense has been calculated using the effective interest rate of 3.06% in effect at December 31, 2017 on the unhedged variable rate portion of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings and 3.67% on the fixed rate hedged portion \n of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. The interest expense calculation reflects assumed payments on the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings consistent with the disclosures in footnote (2) above. \nGuarantees\nWe enter into a wide range of indemnification arrangements, guarantees and assurances in the ordinary course of business and have evaluated agreements that contain guarantees and indemnification clauses. These include tort indemnities, tax indemnities, indemnities against third-party claims arising out of arrangements to provide services to us and indemnities related to the sale of our securities. We also indemnify individuals made party to any suit or proceeding if that individual was acting as an officer or director of US Ecology or was serving at the request of US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries during their tenure as a director or officer. We also provide guarantees and indemnifications for the benefit of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to satisfy performance obligations, including closure and post-closure financial assurances. It is difficult to quantify the maximum potential liability under these indemnification arrangements; however, we are not currently aware of any material liabilities to the Company or any of its subsidiaries arising from these arrangements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe maintain funded trusts agreements, surety bonds and insurance policies for future closure and post-closure obligations at both current and formerly operated disposal facilities. These funded trust agreements, surety bonds and insurance policies are based on management estimates of future closure and post-closure monitoring using engineering evaluations and interpretations of regulatory requirements which are periodically updated. Accounting for closure and post-closure costs includes final disposal cell capping and revegetation, soil and groundwater monitoring and routine maintenance and surveillance required after a site is closed.\nWe estimate that our undiscounted future closure and post-closure costs for all facilities was approximately $308.5 million at December 31, 2017, with a median payment year of 2061. Our future closure and post-closure estimates are our best estimate of current costs and are updated periodically to reflect current technology, cost of materials and services, applicable laws, regulations, permit conditions or orders and other factors. These current costs are adjusted for anticipated annual inflation, which we assumed to be 2.6% as of December 31, 2017. These future closure and post-closure estimates are discounted to their present value for financial reporting purposes using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, which approximates our incremental long-term borrowing rate in effect at the time the obligation is established or when there are upward revisions to our estimated closure and post-closure costs. At December 31, 2017, our weighted-average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate was 5.9%. For financial reporting purposes, our recorded closure and post-closure obligations were $76.1 million and $75.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThrough December 31, 2017, we have met our financial assurance requirements through insurance, surety bonds, standby letters of credit and self-funded restricted trusts.\nU.S. Operating and Non-Operating Facilities\nWe cover our closure and post-closure obligations for our U.S. operating facilities through the use of third-party insurance policies, surety bonds and standby letters of credit. Insurance policies covering our closure and post-closure obligations expire in April 2018 and December 2018. Our total policy limits are approximately $87.4 million. At December 31, 2017 our trust accounts had $5.8 million for our closure and post-closure obligations and are identified as Restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAll closure and post-closure funding obligations for our Beatty, Nevada and Richland, Washington facilities revert to the respective State. Volume based fees are collected from our customers and remitted to state controlled trust funds to cover the estimated cost of closure and post-closure obligations.\nStablex\nWe use commercial surety bonds to cover our closure obligations for our Stablex facility located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Our lease agreement with the Province of Qu\u00e9bec requires that the surety bond be maintained for 25 years after\nthe lease expires in 2023. At December 31, 2017 we had $752,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations. These bonds were renewed in November and December 2017 and expire in November and December 2018. Post-closure funding obligations for the Stablex landfill revert back to the Province of Qu\u00e9bec through a dedicated trust account that is funded based on a per-metric-ton disposed fee by Stablex.\nWe expect to renew insurance policies and commercial surety bonds in the future. If we are unable to obtain adequate closure, post-closure or environmental liability insurance and/or commercial surety bonds in future years, any partial or completely uninsured claim against us, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, continued access to casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits, at acceptable terms, is important to obtaining new business. Failure to maintain adequate financial assurance could also result in regulatory action including early closure of facilities. While we believe we will be able to maintain the requisite financial assurance policies at a reasonable cost, premium and collateral requirements may materially increase.\nOperation of disposal facilities creates operational, closure and post-closure obligations that could result in unplanned monitoring and corrective action costs. We cannot predict the likelihood or effect of all such costs, new laws or regulations, litigation or other future events affecting our facilities. We do not believe that continuing to satisfy our environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nSeasonal Effects\nSeasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles can influence the timing of customer spending for our services. Typically, in the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for our services due to reduced construction and business activities related to weather while we experience improvement in our second and third quarters of each calendar year as weather conditions and other business activity improves.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates included in our critical accounting policies discussed below and those accounting policies and use of estimates discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions and other factors we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We make adjustments to judgments and estimates based on current facts and circumstances on an ongoing basis. Historically, actual results have not deviated significantly from those determined using the estimates described below or in Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, actual amounts could differ materially from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and disposal have occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from three primary sources: 1) waste treatment, recycling and disposal, 2) field and industrial waste management services and 3) waste transportation services.\nWaste treatment and disposal revenue results primarily from fees charged to customers for treatment and/or disposal or recycling of specified wastes. Waste treatment and disposal revenue is generally charged on a per-ton or per-yard basis based on contracted prices and is recognized when services are complete.\nField and industrial waste management services revenue results primarily from specialty onsite services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, and other government, commercial and industrial facilities. These services are provided based on purchase orders or agreements with the customer and include prices based upon daily, hourly or job rates for equipment, materials and personnel. Revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized on contracts with retainage when services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.\nTransportation revenue results from delivering customer waste to a disposal facility for treatment and/or disposal or recycling. Transportation services are generally not provided on a stand-alone basis and instead are bundled with other Company services. However, in some instances we provide transportation and logistics services for shipment of waste from cleanup sites to disposal facilities operated by other companies. We account for our bundled arrangements as multiple deliverable arrangements and determine the amount of revenue recognized for each deliverable (unit of accounting) using the relative fair value method. Transportation revenue is recognized when the transported waste is received at the disposal facility. Waste treatment and disposal revenue under bundled arrangements is recognized when services are complete and the waste is disposed in the landfill.\nBurial fees collected from customers for each ton or cubic yard of waste disposed in our landfills are paid to the respective local and/or state government entity and are not included in revenue. Revenue and associated costs from waste that has been received but not yet treated and disposed of in our landfills are deferred until disposal occurs.\nOur Richland, Washington disposal facility is regulated by the WUTC, which approves our rates for disposal of LLRW. Annual revenue levels are established based on a six-year rate agreement with the WUTC at amounts sufficient to cover the costs of operation and provide us with a reasonable profit. Per-unit rates charged to LLRW customers during the year are based on our evaluation of disposal volume and radioactivity projections submitted to us by waste generators. Our proposed rates are then reviewed and approved by the WUTC. If annual revenue exceeds the approved levels set by the WUTC, we are required to refund excess collections to facility users on a pro-rata basis. The current rate agreement with the WUTC was extended in 2013 and is effective until January 1, 2020.\nDisposal Facility Accounting\nWe amortize landfill and disposal assets and certain related permits over their estimated useful lives. The units-of-consumption method is used to amortize landfill cell construction and development costs and asset retirement costs. Under the units-of-consumption method, we include costs incurred to date as well as future estimated construction costs in the amortization base of the landfill assets. Additionally, where appropriate, as discussed below, we also include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill asset. If we determine that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the total remaining useful life of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense over the remaining estimated useful life of the landfill asset. If at any time we make the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort would be expensed in the period of abandonment.\nOur landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which require accounting judgments and estimates:\n \u00b7 Landfill assets comprised of capitalized landfill development costs. \n \u00b7 Disposal facility retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities that result in corresponding retirement assets. \nLandfill Assets\nLandfill assets include the costs of landfill site acquisition, permits and cell design and construction incurred to date. Landfill cells represent individual disposal areas within the overall treatment and disposal site and may be subject to specific permit requirements in addition to the general permit requirements associated with the overall site.\nTo develop, construct and operate a landfill cell, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the landfill cell will be permitted.\nUpon receipt of regulatory approval, technical landfill cell designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill cell including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill cell.\nThe types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates at least annually. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill cell, including personnel costs of employees directly associated with the landfill cell design, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.\nTo match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill asset on a units-of-consumption basis over its operating life, typically on a cubic yard or cubic meter of disposal space consumed. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill cell's operating life. The per-unit amortization rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill cell, by the landfill cell's estimated remaining disposal capacity. Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill cell, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and valued them at the time of acquisition based on fair value.\nIncluded in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill cell. These factors include the area over which the landfill cell will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill cell elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. Landfill cell capacity used in the determination of amortization rates of our landfill assets includes both permitted and unpermitted disposal capacity. Unpermitted disposal capacity is included when management believes achieving final regulatory approval is probable based on our analysis of site conditions and interactions with applicable regulatory agencies.\nWe review the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill cell at least annually. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are developed using input from independent engineers and internal technical and accounting managers and are reviewed and approved by our environmental management group. Any changes in future estimated costs or estimated disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill cell amortization rates.\nWe assess our long-lived landfill assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate impairment of any of our landfill assets include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u00b7 Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements impacting the landfill site permitting process making it more difficult and costly to obtain and/or maintain a landfill permit; \n \u00b7 Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits, which could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit and adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of, or abandon, a project, which could result in an asset impairment; and \n \u00b7 Unexpected significant increases in estimated costs, significant reductions in prices we are able to charge our customers or reductions in disposal capacity that affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill. \nDisposal Facility Retirement Obligations\nDisposal facility retirement obligations include the cost to close, maintain and monitor landfill cells and support facilities. As individual landfill cells reach capacity, we must cap and close the cells in accordance with the landfill cell permits. These capping and closure requirements are detailed in the technical design of each landfill cell and included as part of our approved regulatory permit. After the entire landfill cell has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the landfill cell for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the landfill cell and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the landfill cell has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, transportation and disposal of landfill leachate, and erosion control costs related to the final cap.\nWe have a legally enforceable obligation to operate our landfill cells in accordance with the specific requirements, regulations and criteria set forth in our permits. This includes executing the approved closure/post-closure plan and closing/capping the entire landfill cell in accordance with the established requirements, design and criteria contained in the permit. As a result, we record the fair value of our disposal facility retirement obligations as a liability in the period in which the regulatory obligation to retire a specific asset is triggered. For our individual landfill cells, the required closure and post-closure obligations under the terms of our permits and our intended operation of the landfill cell are triggered and recorded when the cell is placed into service and waste is initially disposed in the landfill cell. The fair value is based on the total estimated costs to close the landfill cell and perform post-closure activities once the landfill cell has reached capacity and is no longer accepting waste, discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that is used to calculate the recorded liability, with accretion charged to direct operating costs. Actual cash expenditures to perform closure and post-closure activities reduce the retirement obligation liabilities as incurred. After initial measurement, asset retirement obligations are adjusted at the end of each period to reflect changes, if any, in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. Disposal facility retirement assets are capitalized as the related disposal facility retirement obligations are incurred. Disposal facility retirement assets are amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as the disposal capacity is consumed.\nOur disposal facility retirement obligations represent the present value of current cost estimates to close, maintain and monitor landfills and support facilities as described above. Cost estimates are developed using input from independent engineers, internal technical and accounting managers, as well as our environmental management group's interpretation of current legal and regulatory requirements, and are intended to approximate fair value. We estimate the timing of future payments based on expected annual disposal airspace consumption and then inflate the current cost estimate by an inflation rate, estimated at December 31, 2017 to be 2.6%. Inflated current costs are then discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, which approximates our incremental borrowing rate in effect at the time the obligation is established or when there are upward revisions to our estimated closure and post-closure costs. Our weighted-average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate at December 31, 2017 was approximately 5.9%. Final closure and post-closure obligations are currently estimated as being paid through the year 2105. During 2017 we updated several assumptions, including estimated costs and timing of closing our disposal cells. These updates resulted in a net decrease to our post-closure obligations of $352,000.\nWe update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill cell on an annual basis. Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of the required future activities to close, maintain and monitor landfills and facilities result in both: (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and\nrelated asset and (ii) a change in accretion and amortization rates which are applied prospectively over the remaining life of the asset. A hypothetical 1% increase in the inflation rate would increase our closure/post-closure obligation by $16.9 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in our cost estimates would increase our closure/post-closure obligation by $7.6 million.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's goodwill balance was $189.4 million. We assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter as of October 1 of each year, and also if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The assessment consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, including goodwill. Some of the factors that could indicate impairment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or failure to generate sufficient cash flows at the reporting unit. For example, field and industrial services represents an emerging business for the Company and has been the focus of a shift in strategy since the acquisition of EQ. Failure to execute on planned growth initiatives within this business could lead to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in future periods.\nWe determine our reporting units by identifying the components of each operating segment, and then aggregate components having similar economic characteristics based on quantitative and/or qualitative factors. At December 31, 2017, we had 14 reporting units, 8 of which had allocated goodwill.\nFair values are generally determined by using a market approach, applying a multiple of earnings based on guideline for publicly traded companies, an income approach, discounting projected future cash flows based on our expectations of the current and future operating environment, or a combination thereof. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. The rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry, capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired, and an impairment charge would be recognized during the period in which the determination has been made for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe result of the annual assessment of goodwill undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value, with the exception of the Resource Recovery reporting unit.\nOur Resource Recovery reporting unit offers full-service storm water management and propylene glycol ( PG\u201d) deicing fluid recovery at major airports. Recovered fluids are transported to our recycling facility in Romulus, Michigan where they are distilled and resold to industrial users. The Resource Recovery reporting unit also generates revenues from brokered PG sales and services revenues for PG collection at the airports we service. Weak PG commodity prices and reduced PG collection volumes at the airports we service negatively impacted the reporting unit's prospective financial information in its discounted cash flow model and the reporting unit's estimated fair value. A longer-than-expected recovery in PG commodity pricing and PG collection volumes became evident during the fourth quarter of 2017 as management completed its 2018 budgeting cycle and updated the long-term projections for the reporting unit which, as a result, decreased the reporting unit's anticipated future cash flows as compared to those estimated previously.\nThe estimated fair value of the Resource Recovery reporting unit was determined under an income approach using discounted projected future cash flows and then compared to the reporting unit's carrying amount as of October 1, 2017. Based on the results of that comparison, the carrying amount of the Resource Recovery reporting unit, including $5.5 million of goodwill, exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by more than $5.5 million and, as a result, we recognized a $5.5 million impairment charge, representing the reporting unit's entire goodwill balance, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe review intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment during the fourth quarter as of October 1 of each year. Fair value is generally determined by considering an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period in which the annual assessment occurs.\nThe result of the annual assessment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated no impairment charges were required, with the exception of the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit associated with our Resource Recovery business.\nIn performing the annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test, the estimated fair value of the Resource Recovery business' waste collection, recycling and resale permit was determined under an income approach using discounted projected future cash flows associated with the permit and then compared to the $3.7 million carrying amount of the permit as of October 1, 2017. Based on the results of that evaluation, the carrying amount of the permit exceeded the estimated fair value of the permit and, as a result, we recognized a $3.4 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. The factors and timing contributing to the nonamortizing permit impairment charge were the same as the factors and timing described above with regards to the Resource Recovery reporting unit goodwill impairment charge.\nWe also review finite-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the assets' carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering: (i) the internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis; (ii) a third-party valuation; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period in which the events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable occurred.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed an assessment of the Resource Recovery business' finite-lived tangible and intangible assets, as events indicated their carrying values may not be recoverable. The result of the assessment indicated no impairment charges were required. Otherwise, no events or circumstances occurred during 2017 that would indicate that our finite-lived tangible and intangible assets may be impaired, therefore no other impairment tests were performed during 2017 other than the annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives conducted in the fourth quarter of every year.\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Allstate to a private investor group. Allstate represents the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this agreement and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Our interim goodwill impairment test which included both Step I and Step II analysis was performed and resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million being recognized in the second quarter of 2015. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nOur acquired permits and licenses generally have renewal terms of approximately 5-10 years. We have a history of renewing these permits and licenses as demonstrated by the fact that each of the sites' treatment permits and licenses have been renewed regularly since the facility began operations. We intend to continue to renew our permits and licenses as they come up for renewal for the foreseeable future. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of our permits and licenses are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare Based Payments\nOn May 27, 2015, our stockholders approved the Omnibus Incentive Plan ( Omnibus Plan\u201d), which was approved by our Board of Directors on April 7, 2015. The Omnibus Plan was developed to provide additional incentives through equity ownership in US Ecology and, as a result, encourage employees and directors to contribute to our success. The Omnibus Plan provides, among other things, the ability for the Company to grant restricted stock, performance stock, options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units ( PSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards or cash awards to officers, employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Subsequent to the approval of the Omnibus Plan in May 2015, we stopped granting equity awards under our 2008 Stock Option Incentive Plan and our 2006 Restricted Stock Plan ( Previous Plans\u201d), and the Previous Plans will remain in effect solely for the settlement of awards granted under the Previous Plans. No shares that are reserved but unissued under the Previous Plans or that are outstanding under the Previous Plans and reacquired by the Company for any reason will be available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. The Omnibus Plan expires on April 7, 2025 and authorizes 1,500,000 shares of common stock for grant over the life of the Omnibus Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have PSUs outstanding under the Omnibus Plan. Each PSU represents the right to receive, on the settlement date, one share of the Company's common stock. The total number of PSUs each participant is eligible to earn ranges from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs granted. The actual number of PSUs that will vest and be settled in shares is determined at the end of a three-year performance period, based on total stockholder return relative to a set of peer companies and the S&P 600. The fair value of the PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation of awards granted during 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have stock option awards outstanding under the 1992 Stock Option Plan for Employees ( 1992 Employee Plan\u201d) and the 2008 Stock Option Incentive Plan ( 2008 Stock Option Plan\u201d). Subsequent to the approval of the Omnibus Plan in May 2015, we stopped granting equity awards under the 2008 Stock Option Plan. The 2008 Stock Option Plan will remain in effect solely for the settlement of awards previously granted. In April 2013, the 1992 Employee Plan expired and was cancelled except for options then outstanding.\nThe determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected term of stock options and expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions utilized in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nThe Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach whereby we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for the likelihood of use in future periods. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance, if any, requires our judgment and the use of estimates. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we have deferred tax assets totaling approximately $15.9 million, a valuation allowance of $2.2 million and deferred tax liabilities totaling approximately $71.2 million.\nThe application of income tax law is inherently complex. Tax laws and regulations are voluminous and at times ambiguous and interpretations of guidance regarding such tax laws and regulations change over time. This requires us to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. A liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded in our financial statements on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position taken will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. As facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We recognize interest assessed by taxing authorities or interest associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense. We recognize any penalties assessed by taxing authorities or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company has calculated a provisional amount of the impact of the Tax Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and as a result has recorded $23.8 million as a net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional benefit amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was $25.2 million. The provisional expense amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $1.4 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $26.7 million.\nIn connection with the Tax Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined that the $25.2 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $1.4 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional amounts estimated based on information available as of December 31, 2017. These amounts are subject to change as we obtain information necessary to complete the calculations. Any subsequent adjustment to these provisional amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in 2018, when the analysis is complete. We expect to complete our analysis of the provisional items during the second half of 2018. The effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are being analyzed and are subject to change as additional information, guidance, and regulation becomes available.\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.\nLitigation\nWe have, in the past, been involved in litigation requiring estimates of timing and loss potential whose timing and ultimate disposition is controlled by the judicial process. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any ongoing, pending or threatened legal action that management believes, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The decision to accrue costs or write off assets is based on the pertinent facts and our evaluation of present circumstances.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or interests in variable interest entities that would require consolidation. US Ecology operates through wholly-owned subsidiaries.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nUS Ecology, Inc. is a leading North American provider of environmental services to commercial and government entities. The Company addresses the complex waste management needs of its customers, offering treatment, disposal and recycling of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste, as well as a wide range of complementary field and industrial services. US Ecology's comprehensive knowledge of the waste business, its collection of waste management facilities and focus on safety, environmental compliance, and customer service enables us to effectively meet the needs of our customers and to build long-lasting relationships.\nWe have fixed facilities and service centers operating in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our fixed facilities include five RCRA subtitle C hazardous waste landfills and one LLRW landfill located near Beatty, Nevada; Richland, Washington; Robstown, Texas; Grand View, Idaho; Detroit, Michigan and Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. These facilities\ngenerate revenue from fees charged to treat and dispose of waste and from fees charged to perform various field and industrial services for our customers.\nOn November 1, 2015, we sold our Allstate Power Vac, Inc. ( Allstate\u201d) subsidiary to a private investor group. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur operations are managed in two reportable segments reflecting our internal management reporting structure and nature of services offered as follows:\nEnvironmental Services-This segment provides a broad range of hazardous material management services including transportation, recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at Company-owned landfill, wastewater and other treatment facilities.\nField & Industrial Services-This segment provides packaging and collection of hazardous waste and total waste management solutions at customer sites and through our 10-day transfer facilities. Services include on-site management, waste characterization, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. This segment also provides specialty services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response and other services to commercial and industrial facilities and to government entities.\nIn order to provide insight into the underlying drivers of our waste volumes and related treatment and disposal ( T&D\u201d) revenues, we evaluate period-to-period changes in our T&D revenue for our Environmental Services segment based on the industry of the waste generator, based on North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS\u201d) codes.\nThe composition of the Environmental Services segment T&D revenues by waste generator industry for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\n (1) Excludes all transportation service revenue \n (2) Includes retail and wholesale trade, rate regulated, construction and other industries \nWe also categorize our Environmental Services T&D revenue as either Base Business\u201d or Event Business\u201d based on the underlying nature of the revenue source.\nBase Business consists of waste streams from ongoing industrial activities and tends to be reoccurring in nature. We define Event Business as non-recurring projects that are expected to equal or exceed 1,000 tons, with Base Business defined as all other business not meeting the definition of Event Business. The duration of Event Business projects can last from a several-week cleanup of a contaminated site to a multiple year cleanup project.\nDuring 2017, Base Business revenue growth was up 5% compared to 2016. Base Business revenue was approximately 78% of total 2017 T&D revenue, down from 82% in 2016. Our business is highly competitive and no assurance can be given that we will maintain these revenue levels or increase our market share.\nA significant portion of our disposal revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business projects which vary widely in size, duration and unit pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 22% of our T&D revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event Business, diverse spectrum of waste types received and widely varying unit pricing necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability may be influenced by general and industry-specific economic conditions, funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions or court orders, public controversy, litigation, weather, commercial real estate, closed military bases and other project timing, government appropriation and funding cycles and other factors. The types and amounts of waste received from Base Business also vary from quarter to quarter.\nThis variability can also cause significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year differences in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and net income. While we pursue many projects months or years in advance of work performance, cleanup project opportunities routinely arise with little or no prior notice. These market dynamics are inherent to the waste disposal business and are factored into our projections and externally communicated business outlook statements. Our projections combine historical experience with identified sales pipeline opportunities, new or expanded service line projections and prevailing market conditions.\nDepending on project-specific customer needs and competitive economics, transportation services may be offered at or near our cost to help secure new business. For waste transported by rail from the eastern United States and other locations distant from our Grand View, Idaho and Robstown, Texas facilities, transportation-related revenue can account for as much as 75% of total project revenue. While bundling transportation and disposal services reduces overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenue ( gross margin\u201d), this value-added service has allowed us to win multiple projects that management believes we could not have otherwise competed for successfully. Our Company-owned fleet of gondola railcars, which is periodically supplemented with railcars obtained under operating leases, has reduced our transportation expenses by largely eliminating reliance on more costly short-term rentals. These Company-owned railcars also help us to win business during times of demand-driven railcar scarcity.\nThe increased waste volumes resulting from projects won through this bundled service strategy further drive operating leverage benefits inherent to the disposal business, increasing profitability. While waste treatment and other variable costs are project-specific, the incremental earnings contribution from large and small projects generally increases as overall disposal volumes increase. Based on past experience, management believes that maximizing operating income, net income and earnings per share is a higher priority than maintaining or increasing gross margin. We intend to continue aggressively bidding bundled transportation and disposal services based on this proven strategy.\nWe serve oil refineries, chemical production plants, steel mills, waste brokers/aggregators serving small manufacturers and other industrial customers that are generally affected by the prevailing economic conditions and credit environment. Adverse conditions may cause our customers as well as those they serve to curtail operations, resulting in lower waste production and/or delayed spending on off-site waste shipments, maintenance, waste cleanup projects and other work. Factors that can impact general economic conditions and the level of spending by customers include, but are not limited to, consumer and industrial spending, increases in fuel and energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other global economic factors affecting spending behavior. Market forces may also induce customers to reduce or cease operations, declare bankruptcy, liquidate or relocate to other countries, any of which could adversely affect our business. To the extent business is either government funded or driven by government regulations or enforcement actions, we believe it is less susceptible to general economic conditions. Spending by government agencies may be reduced due to declining tax revenues resulting from a weak economy or changes in policy. Disbursement of funds appropriated by Congress may also be delayed for various reasons.\nOur results of operations have been affected by certain significant events during the past three fiscal years including, but not limited to:\n2017 Events\nGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Asset Impairment Charges: Based on the results of the Company's annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, during the fourth quarter we recorded a $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge in our Resource Recovery reporting unit and a $3.4 million impairment charge on the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit associated with our Resource Recovery business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company calculated a provisional amount of the impact of the Tax Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as a result, recorded a $23.8 million net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWrite-off of Deferred Financing Costs: In connection with the refinancing of the Company's outstanding debt, we wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n2016 Events\nDivestiture of Augusta, Georgia Facility: On April 5, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our Augusta, Georgia facility for cash proceeds of $1.9 million. The Augusta, Georgia facility was reported as part of our Environmental Services segment. Sales, net income and total assets of the Augusta, Georgia facility are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations in any period presented. We recognized a $1.9 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of the Augusta, Georgia facility, which is included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition of Environmental Services Inc.: On May 2, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Environmental Services Inc., ( ESI\u201d), an environmental services company based in Tilbury, Ontario, Canada. The total purchase price was $4.9 million, net of cash acquired, and was funded with cash on hand. Revenues and total assets of ESI are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We recorded $1.5 million of intangible assets and $1.0 million of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the acquisition. Definite-lived intangibles will be amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 14 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually.\nAcquisition of Vernon, California Facility: On October 1, 2016, the Company acquired the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC. The total purchase price was $5.0 million and was funded with cash on hand. Revenues and total assets of the Vernon, California facility are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We recorded $3.2 million of intangible assets and $354,000 of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the acquisition. Definite-lived intangibles will be amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 20 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually.\n2015 Events\nSale of Allstate Power Vac, Inc. ( Allstate\u201d) and Goodwill Impairment: On November 1, 2015, we sold our Allstate subsidiary to a private investor group for cash proceeds of $58.8 million. Allstate represented the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this divestiture and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Based on this analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015. We recognized a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Allstate, including transaction-related costs, of $542,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we received additional cash proceeds of $827,000 in settlement of final post-closing adjustments and recognized an additional $178,000 pre-tax gain. Gains and losses related to the sale of Allstate are included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. Cash proceeds from the transaction were used to repay debt. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results and percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nThe primary financial measure used by management to assess segment performance is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation, accretion of closure and post-closure liabilities, foreign currency gain/loss, non-cash impairment charges, gain/loss on divestiture and other income/expense. The reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and we believe that such information provides additional useful information to analysts, stockholders and other users to understand the Company's operating performance. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and \n \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. \n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased 6% to $504.0 million in 2017, compared with $477.7 million in 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment revenue increased 8% to $366.3 million in 2017, compared to $337.8 million in 2016. T&D revenue increased 8% in 2017, primarily as a result of a 23% increase in project-based Event Business revenue and a 5% increase in Base Business revenue. Transportation and logistics service revenue increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting more Event Business projects utilizing the Company's transportation and logistics services. Tons of waste disposed of or processed increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nT&D revenue from recurring Base Business waste generators increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 and comprised 78% of total T&D revenue. During 2017, increases in Base Business T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, refining, general manufacturing, and Other\u201d industry groups were partially offset by decreases in T&D revenue from Base Business in the broker/TSDF industry group.\nT&D revenue from Event Business waste generators increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016 and comprised 22% of total T&D revenue. The increase in Event Business T&D revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects higher T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, metal manufacturing, government and Other\u201d industry groups, partially offset by lower T&D revenue from the general manufacturing industry group. The increase in revenue from the chemical manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to a large East Coast remedial cleanup project. The decrease in revenue from the general manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to lower Event Business volume.\nThe following table summarizes combined Base Business and Event Business T&D revenue growth, within the Environmental Services segment, by waste generator industry for 2017 compared to 2016:\n\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment revenue decreased 2% to $137.7 million in 2017 compared with $139.9 million in 2016. The decrease in Field & Industrial Services segment revenue is primarily attributable to the expiration of a contract that was not renewed or replaced and softer overall market conditions for industrial and remediation services.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit increased 4% to $153.1 million in 2017, up from $147.6 million in 2016. Total gross margin was 30% for 2017 compared with 31% for 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment gross profit increased 6% to $135.0 million in 2017, up from $126.8 million in 2016. This increase primarily reflects higher T&D volumes in 2017 compared to 2016. Total segment gross margin was 37% for 2017 compared with 38% for 2016. T&D gross margin was 40% for 2017 compared with 42% for 2016. The decrease in T&D gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of the temporary closure of one of our treatment facilities due to wind damage and incremental costs associated with the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and Florida that impacted our operations in 2017.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment gross profit decreased 13% to $18.2 million in 2017, down from $20.8 million in 2016. Total segment gross margin was 13% for 2017 compared with 15% for 2016. The decrease in segment gross margin is attributable to lower route density in our small quantity generation services due to a contract that was not renewed in late 2016 and a less favorable service mix for our industrial and remediation services in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTotal SG&A increased to $84.5 million, or 17% of total revenue, in 2017 compared with $77.6 million, or 16% of total revenue, in 2016.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment SG&A increased 13% to $24.2 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2017 compared with $21.4 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2016, primarily reflecting higher labor and incentive compensation costs, higher property tax expenses and lower gains on sale of assets, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and higher insurance proceeds in 2017 compared to 2016.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment SG&A decreased 8% to $9.3 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2017 compared with $10.1 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2016. The decrease in segment SG&A primarily reflects lower bad debt expense and higher insurance proceeds, partially offset by higher labor and incentive compensation costs in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A was $51.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2017 compared with $46.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2016, primarily reflecting higher labor and incentive compensation costs in 2017 compared to 2016.\nComponents of Adjusted EBITDA\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate for 2017 was -14.9% compared to 38.1% in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 by the U.S. government. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and imposes a deemed repatriation tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. We re-measured our net deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a provisional benefit of $25.2 million to our income tax expense. We also recorded a provisional charge of $1.4 million to our income tax expense for the deemed repatriation transition tax. While we are able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d), and actions we may take. We are continuing to gather additional\ninformation to determine the final impact. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was also attributable to a higher proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2017 which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by non-recurring non-deductible impairment charges as well as a higher effective state tax rate driven by changes in apportionment of income between the various states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2017, we have exhausted all of our federal net operating loss carry forwards ( NOLs\u201d) and have approximately $8.9 million in state and local NOLs for which we maintain a substantial valuation allowance. We maintain a valuation allowance on state and local NOLs when we no longer do business within a state or locality or determine it is unlikely that we will utilize these NOLs in the future. We consider it more likely than not that we will not utilize the majority of these NOLs in the future.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $18.2 million in 2017 compared with $17.3 million in 2016. The Company wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the Former Credit Agreement that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time non-cash charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017. This increase is partially offset by a lower effective interest rate under the New Credit Agreement compared to the Former Credit Agreement and reduced debt levels in 2017 compared to 2016.\nForeign currency gain (loss)\nWe recognized a $516,000 non-cash foreign currency gain in 2017 compared with a $138,000 non-cash foreign currency loss in 2016. Foreign currency gains and losses reflect changes in business activity conducted in a currency other than the USD, our functional currency. Our Canadian subsidiaries' facilities are located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec and Tilbury, Ontario, Canada and use the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) as their functional currency. Additionally, we established intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the CAD, and our parent company, US Ecology, as part of a tax and treasury management strategy allowing for repayment of third-party bank debt. These intercompany loans are payable by our Canadian subsidiaries to US Ecology in CAD requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our statements of operations based on USD/CAD currency movements from period to period. At December 31, 2017, we had $21.4 million of intercompany loans subject to currency revaluation.\nGain on divestiture\nOther income in 2016 includes approximately $2.0 million related to the gain on sale of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016 and final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture.\nDepreciation and amortization of plant and equipment\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $28.3 million in 2017 compared with $25.3 million in 2016, primarily reflecting additional depreciation expense on assets placed in service in 2017.\nAmortization of intangibles\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $9.9 million in 2017 compared with $10.6 million in 2016.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense increased 34% to $3.9 million in 2017, compared with $2.9 million 2016 as a result of an increase in equity-based awards granted to employees.\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities decreased to $3.0 million in 2017 compared with $4.0 million in 2016, primarily reflecting non-cash adjustments to post-closure liabilities recorded in 2017 due to changes in cost estimates associated with closed sites.\nImpairment charges\nBased on the results of our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we recorded a $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge in our Resource Recovery reporting unit and a $3.4 million impairment charge on the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit of our Resource Recovery business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue\nTotal revenue decreased 15% to $477.7 million in 2016, compared with $563.1 million in 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment revenue decreased 6% to $337.8 million in 2016, compared to $359.0 million in 2015. T&D revenue decreased 5% in 2016, primarily as a result of a 30% decrease in project-based Event Business. Transportation and logistics service revenue decreased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting fewer Event Business projects utilizing the Company's transportation and logistics services. Tons of waste disposed of or processed decreased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015.\nT&D revenue from recurring Base Business waste generators increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015 and comprised 82% of total T&D revenue. During 2016, increases in Base Business T&D revenue from the refining, Other\u201d, utilities and general manufacturing industry groups were partially offset by decreases in T&D revenue from Base Business in the chemical manufacturing and broker/TSDF industry groups.\nT&D revenue from Event Business waste generators decreased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015 and comprised 18% of total T&D revenue. The decrease in Event Business T&D revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects lower T&D revenue from the chemical manufacturing, refining and government industry groups, partially offset by higher T&D revenue from the general manufacturing and Other\u201d industry groups. The decrease in revenue from the chemical manufacturing industry group is primarily attributable to the completion of a large East Coast remedial cleanup project in the third quarter of 2015 and the completion of a nuclear fuels fabrication plant decommissioning in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue from the refining and government industry groups is primarily attributable to lower Event Business volumes.\nThe following table summarizes combined Base Business and Event Business T&D revenue growth, within the Environmental Services segment, by waste generator industry for 2016 compared to 2015:\n\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment revenue decreased 31% to $139.9 million in 2016 compared with $204.0 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the divested Allstate business which contributed segment revenue of $59.1 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit decreased 14% to $147.6 million in 2016, down from $171.4 million in 2015. Total gross margin was 31% for 2016 compared with 30% for 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment gross profit decreased 8% to $126.8 million in 2016, down from $137.6 million in 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower T&D volumes in 2016 compared to 2015. Total segment gross margin was 38% for both 2016 and 2015. T&D gross margin was 42% for 2016 compared with 43% for 2015.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment gross profit decreased 38% to $20.8 million in 2016, down from $33.8 million in 2015. Total segment gross margin was 15% for 2016 compared with 17% for 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed segment gross profit of $12.4 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTotal SG&A decreased to $77.6 million, or 16% of total revenue, in 2016 compared with $93.1 million, or 17% of total revenue, in 2015.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental Services segment SG&A decreased 6% to $21.4 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2016 compared with $22.8 million, or 6% of segment revenue, in 2015, primarily reflecting higher gains on sales of assets in 2016 compared to 2015.\nField & Industrial Services\nField & Industrial Services segment SG&A decreased 54% to $10.1 million, or 7% of segment revenue, in 2016 compared with $22.0 million, or 11% of segment revenue, in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed segment SG&A of $10.9 million for our period of ownership in 2015. The remaining decrease in segment SG&A primarily reflects lower employee labor costs in 2016 compared to 2015.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A was $46.0 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2016 compared with $48.4 million, or 9% of total revenue, in 2015, primarily reflecting lower business development expenses and lower professional services expenses in 2016 compared to 2015.\nComponents of Adjusted EBITDA\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate for 2016 was 38.1% compared to 45.3% in 2015. The decrease reflects nonrecurring non-deductible goodwill impairment charges incurred in 2015, a nondeductible loss on the sale of the Allstate business recorded\nduring 2015 and a decrease in our U.S. effective tax rate, driven by a lower overall effective state tax rate. The lower effective state tax rate was driven by changes in apportionment of income and deferred taxes between the various states in which we operate. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a lower proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2016, which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $17,000 in federal NOLs acquired from EQ. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $12.7 million in state and local NOLs for which we maintain a substantial valuation allowance. We maintain a valuation allowance on state and local NOLs when we no longer do business within a state or locality or determine it is unlikely that we will utilize these NOLs in the future. We consider it more likely than not that we will not utilize the majority of these NOLs in the future.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $17.3 million in 2016 compared with $23.4 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to $291,000 of incremental non-cash amortization of deferred financing fees associated with debt principal payments in 2016 compared with $2.4 million of incremental amortization in 2015. The remaining decrease is attributable to lower debt levels in 2016 compared with 2015.\nForeign currency gain (loss)\nWe recognized a $138,000 non-cash foreign currency loss in 2016 compared with a $2.2 million non-cash foreign currency loss in 2015. Foreign currency gains and losses reflect changes in business activity conducted in a currency other than the USD, our functional currency. Our Canadian subsidiaries' facilities are located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec and Tilbury, Ontario, Canada and use the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) as their functional currency. Additionally, we established intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the CAD, and our parent company, US Ecology, as part of a tax and treasury management strategy allowing for repayment of third-party bank debt. These intercompany loans are payable by our Canadian subsidiaries to US Ecology in CAD requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our statements of operations based on USD/CAD currency movements from period to period. At December 31, 2016, we had $20.8 million of intercompany loans subject to currency revaluation.\nGain on divestiture\nOther income in 2016 includes approximately $2.0 million related to the gain on sale of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016 and final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture.\nDepreciation and amortization of plant and equipment\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $25.3 million in 2016 compared with $27.9 million in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed depreciation and amortization expense of $2.2 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nAmortization of intangibles\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $10.6 million in 2016 compared with $12.3 million in 2015. The divested Allstate business contributed intangible assets amortization expense of $1.4 million for our period of ownership in 2015.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense increased 27% to $2.9 million in 2016, compared with $2.3 million 2015 as a result of an increase in equity-based awards granted to employees.\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities\nAccretion and non-cash adjustment of closure and post-closure liabilities was $4.0 million in 2016 compared with $4.6 million in 2015.\nImpairment charges\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Allstate to a private investor group. Allstate represented the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this agreement and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Based on this analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new senior secured credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d). At December 31, 2017, we had $27.0 million in cash and cash equivalents immediately available and $216.7 million of borrowing capacity available under the New Credit Agreement. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, paying principal and interest on our long-term debt, and paying declared dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We believe future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating, investing and dividend cash needs for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, existing cash balances and availability of additional borrowings under the New Credit Agreement provide additional sources of liquidity should they be required.\nOperating Activities. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $81.0 million. This primarily reflects net income of $49.4 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $41.2 million, non-cash impairment charges of $8.9 million, amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs of $6.0 million, a decrease in income taxes receivable of $4.1 million, share-based compensation expense of $3.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $3.9 and an increase in accrued salaries and benefits of $3.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $25.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $13.9 million, and a decrease in closure and post-closure obligations of $1.8 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The increase in receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of customer payments. Changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments. Changes in deferred income taxes are primarily attributable to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the provisions of the Tax Act.\nDays sales outstanding were 77 days as of December 31, 2017, compared to 73 days as of December 31, 2016.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $74.6 million. This primarily reflects net income of $34.3 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $39.8 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $10.9 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.9 million, non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.0 million, and a decrease in other assets of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.7 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $2.7 million, the gain recognized on the divestiture of the Augusta, Georgia facility in April 2016, final closing adjustments on the Allstate divestiture of $2.0 million, and an increase in income taxes receivable of $2.0 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The decrease in receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of customer payments. Changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $71.5 million. This primarily reflects net income of $25.6 million, non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion of $44.8 million, non-cash impairment charges of $6.7 million, a decrease in income taxes receivable of $4.8 million, non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.4 million, unrealized foreign currency losses of $3.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.5 million, a decrease in closure and post-closure obligations of $5.7 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $4.4 million, a decrease in income taxes payable of $3.9 million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of $2.7 million. Impacts on net income are due to the factors discussed above under Results of Operations.\u201d The decrease in receivables and deferred revenue is primarily attributable to the timing of the treatment and disposal of waste associated with a significant East Coast remedial cleanup project. The changes in income taxes receivable and payable are primarily\nattributable to the timing of income tax payments. The decrease in closure and post-closure obligations is primarily attributable to payments made for closure and post-closure activities primarily at our closed landfills.\nInvesting Activities. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $35.3 million, primarily related to capital expenditures. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Beatty, Nevada and Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada locations and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at our corporate and operating facilities.\nIn 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $42.0 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $35.7 million, the purchase of the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC for $5.0 million and the purchase of Environmental Services Inc., ( ESI\u201d), for $4.9 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of our Augusta, Georgia facility for $2.7 million, net of cash divested. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, Beatty, Nevada and Robstown, Texas facilities and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at our corporate and operating facilities.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $20.3 million, primarily related to the divestiture of Allstate for $58.7 million, net of cash divested, partially offset by capital expenditures of $39.4 million. Significant capital projects included construction of additional disposal capacity at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and Robstown, Texas locations and equipment purchases and infrastructure upgrades at all of our corporate and operating facilities.\nFinancing Activities. During 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $26.3 million, consisting primarily of $283.0 million of repayment of the Company's long-term debt under the Former Credit Agreement, $281.0 million of initial proceeds from the borrowing of long-term debt under the New Credit Agreement, $4.0 million of subsequent repayments of long-term debt under the New Credit Agreement, $15.7 million of dividend payments to our stockholders, $3.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the New Credit Agreement and net payment activity on the Company's short-term borrowings of $2.2 million.\nDuring 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $31.6 million, consisting primarily of $18.0 million of payments on our Term Loan and $15.7 million of dividend payments to our stockholders, partially offset by $2.2 million of net proceeds on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund working capital requirements.\nDuring 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $108.4 million, consisting primarily of $94.6 million of payments on our Term Loan and $15.6 million of dividend payments to our stockholders.\nCredit Facility\nOn April 18, 2017, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders, swingline lender and issuing lender, and Bank of America, N.A., as an issuing lender, which provides for a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), including a $75.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of swingline loans used to fund short-term working capital requirements. The New Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature whereby the Company may request up to $200.0 million of additional funds through an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility, through incremental term loans, or some combination thereof. Proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility are restricted solely for working capital and other general corporate purposes (including acquisitions and capital expenditures). Under the Revolving Credit Facility, revolving credit loans are available based on a base rate (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the Company's option, plus an applicable margin which is determined according to a pricing grid under which the interest rate decreases or increases based on our ratio of funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The Company wrote off certain unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the Former Credit Agreement that were to be amortized to interest expense in future periods through a one-time charge of $5.5 million to interest expense in the second quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the effective interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility, including the impact of our interest rate\nswap, was 3.39%. Interest only payments are due either quarterly or on the last day of any interest period, as applicable. In October 2014, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixing the interest rate on $190.0 million, or 69%, of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings as of December 31, 2017. The interest rate swap agreement continued to be effective following the termination of the Former Credit Agreement.\nThe Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.175% to 0.35% on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, with such commitment fee to be reduced based upon the Company's total net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The maximum letter of credit capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is $75.0 million and the New Credit Agreement provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, there were $277.0 million of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. These borrowings are due on the revolving credit maturity date (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) and presented as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company has entered into a sweep arrangement whereby day-to-day cash requirements in excess of available cash balances are advanced to the Company on an as-needed basis with repayments of these advances automatically made from subsequent deposits to our cash operating accounts (the Sweep Arrangement\u201d). Total advances outstanding under the Sweep Arrangement are subject to the $25.0 million swingline loan sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's revolving credit loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are not subject to repayment through the Sweep Arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding subject to the Sweep Arrangement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $216.7 million with $6.3 million of the Revolving Credit Facility issued in the form of standby letters of credit utilized as collateral for closure and post-closure financial assurance and other assurance obligations.\nSee Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's debt.\nContractual Obligations and Guarantees\nContractual Obligations\nUS Ecology's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 become due as follows:\n\n (1) For the purposes of the table above, closure and post-closure obligations are shown on an undiscounted basis and inflated using an estimated annual inflation rate of 2.6%. Cash payments for closure and post-closure obligation extend to the year 2105. \n (2) At December 31, 2017, there were $277.0 million of revolving credit loans outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. These revolving credit loans are due upon the earliest to occur of (a) April 18, 2022 (or, with respect to any lender, such later date as requested by us and accepted by such lender), (b) the date of termination of the entire revolving credit commitment (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) by us, and (c) the date of termination of the revolving credit commitment. \n (3) Interest expense has been calculated using the effective interest rate of 3.06% in effect at December 31, 2017 on the unhedged variable rate portion of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings and 3.67% on the fixed rate hedged portion \n of the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. The interest expense calculation reflects assumed payments on the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings consistent with the disclosures in footnote (2) above. \nGuarantees\nWe enter into a wide range of indemnification arrangements, guarantees and assurances in the ordinary course of business and have evaluated agreements that contain guarantees and indemnification clauses. These include tort indemnities, tax indemnities, indemnities against third-party claims arising out of arrangements to provide services to us and indemnities related to the sale of our securities. We also indemnify individuals made party to any suit or proceeding if that individual was acting as an officer or director of US Ecology or was serving at the request of US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries during their tenure as a director or officer. We also provide guarantees and indemnifications for the benefit of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to satisfy performance obligations, including closure and post-closure financial assurances. It is difficult to quantify the maximum potential liability under these indemnification arrangements; however, we are not currently aware of any material liabilities to the Company or any of its subsidiaries arising from these arrangements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe maintain funded trusts agreements, surety bonds and insurance policies for future closure and post-closure obligations at both current and formerly operated disposal facilities. These funded trust agreements, surety bonds and insurance policies are based on management estimates of future closure and post-closure monitoring using engineering evaluations and interpretations of regulatory requirements which are periodically updated. Accounting for closure and post-closure costs includes final disposal cell capping and revegetation, soil and groundwater monitoring and routine maintenance and surveillance required after a site is closed.\nWe estimate that our undiscounted future closure and post-closure costs for all facilities was approximately $308.5 million at December 31, 2017, with a median payment year of 2061. Our future closure and post-closure estimates are our best estimate of current costs and are updated periodically to reflect current technology, cost of materials and services, applicable laws, regulations, permit conditions or orders and other factors. These current costs are adjusted for anticipated annual inflation, which we assumed to be 2.6% as of December 31, 2017. These future closure and post-closure estimates are discounted to their present value for financial reporting purposes using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, which approximates our incremental long-term borrowing rate in effect at the time the obligation is established or when there are upward revisions to our estimated closure and post-closure costs. At December 31, 2017, our weighted-average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate was 5.9%. For financial reporting purposes, our recorded closure and post-closure obligations were $76.1 million and $75.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThrough December 31, 2017, we have met our financial assurance requirements through insurance, surety bonds, standby letters of credit and self-funded restricted trusts.\nU.S. Operating and Non-Operating Facilities\nWe cover our closure and post-closure obligations for our U.S. operating facilities through the use of third-party insurance policies, surety bonds and standby letters of credit. Insurance policies covering our closure and post-closure obligations expire in April 2018 and December 2018. Our total policy limits are approximately $87.4 million. At December 31, 2017 our trust accounts had $5.8 million for our closure and post-closure obligations and are identified as Restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAll closure and post-closure funding obligations for our Beatty, Nevada and Richland, Washington facilities revert to the respective State. Volume based fees are collected from our customers and remitted to state controlled trust funds to cover the estimated cost of closure and post-closure obligations.\nStablex\nWe use commercial surety bonds to cover our closure obligations for our Stablex facility located in Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Our lease agreement with the Province of Qu\u00e9bec requires that the surety bond be maintained for 25 years after\nthe lease expires in 2023. At December 31, 2017 we had $752,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations. These bonds were renewed in November and December 2017 and expire in November and December 2018. Post-closure funding obligations for the Stablex landfill revert back to the Province of Qu\u00e9bec through a dedicated trust account that is funded based on a per-metric-ton disposed fee by Stablex.\nWe expect to renew insurance policies and commercial surety bonds in the future. If we are unable to obtain adequate closure, post-closure or environmental liability insurance and/or commercial surety bonds in future years, any partial or completely uninsured claim against us, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, continued access to casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits, at acceptable terms, is important to obtaining new business. Failure to maintain adequate financial assurance could also result in regulatory action including early closure of facilities. While we believe we will be able to maintain the requisite financial assurance policies at a reasonable cost, premium and collateral requirements may materially increase.\nOperation of disposal facilities creates operational, closure and post-closure obligations that could result in unplanned monitoring and corrective action costs. We cannot predict the likelihood or effect of all such costs, new laws or regulations, litigation or other future events affecting our facilities. We do not believe that continuing to satisfy our environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nSeasonal Effects\nSeasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles can influence the timing of customer spending for our services. Typically, in the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for our services due to reduced construction and business activities related to weather while we experience improvement in our second and third quarters of each calendar year as weather conditions and other business activity improves.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates included in our critical accounting policies discussed below and those accounting policies and use of estimates discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions and other factors we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We make adjustments to judgments and estimates based on current facts and circumstances on an ongoing basis. Historically, actual results have not deviated significantly from those determined using the estimates described below or in Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, actual amounts could differ materially from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and disposal have occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from three primary sources: 1) waste treatment, recycling and disposal, 2) field and industrial waste management services and 3) waste transportation services.\nWaste treatment and disposal revenue results primarily from fees charged to customers for treatment and/or disposal or recycling of specified wastes. Waste treatment and disposal revenue is generally charged on a per-ton or per-yard basis based on contracted prices and is recognized when services are complete.\nField and industrial waste management services revenue results primarily from specialty onsite services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, and other government, commercial and industrial facilities. These services are provided based on purchase orders or agreements with the customer and include prices based upon daily, hourly or job rates for equipment, materials and personnel. Revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized on contracts with retainage when services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.\nTransportation revenue results from delivering customer waste to a disposal facility for treatment and/or disposal or recycling. Transportation services are generally not provided on a stand-alone basis and instead are bundled with other Company services. However, in some instances we provide transportation and logistics services for shipment of waste from cleanup sites to disposal facilities operated by other companies. We account for our bundled arrangements as multiple deliverable arrangements and determine the amount of revenue recognized for each deliverable (unit of accounting) using the relative fair value method. Transportation revenue is recognized when the transported waste is received at the disposal facility. Waste treatment and disposal revenue under bundled arrangements is recognized when services are complete and the waste is disposed in the landfill.\nBurial fees collected from customers for each ton or cubic yard of waste disposed in our landfills are paid to the respective local and/or state government entity and are not included in revenue. Revenue and associated costs from waste that has been received but not yet treated and disposed of in our landfills are deferred until disposal occurs.\nOur Richland, Washington disposal facility is regulated by the WUTC, which approves our rates for disposal of LLRW. Annual revenue levels are established based on a six-year rate agreement with the WUTC at amounts sufficient to cover the costs of operation and provide us with a reasonable profit. Per-unit rates charged to LLRW customers during the year are based on our evaluation of disposal volume and radioactivity projections submitted to us by waste generators. Our proposed rates are then reviewed and approved by the WUTC. If annual revenue exceeds the approved levels set by the WUTC, we are required to refund excess collections to facility users on a pro-rata basis. The current rate agreement with the WUTC was extended in 2013 and is effective until January 1, 2020.\nDisposal Facility Accounting\nWe amortize landfill and disposal assets and certain related permits over their estimated useful lives. The units-of-consumption method is used to amortize landfill cell construction and development costs and asset retirement costs. Under the units-of-consumption method, we include costs incurred to date as well as future estimated construction costs in the amortization base of the landfill assets. Additionally, where appropriate, as discussed below, we also include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill asset. If we determine that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the total remaining useful life of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense over the remaining estimated useful life of the landfill asset. If at any time we make the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort would be expensed in the period of abandonment.\nOur landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which require accounting judgments and estimates:\n \u00b7 Landfill assets comprised of capitalized landfill development costs. \n \u00b7 Disposal facility retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities that result in corresponding retirement assets. \nLandfill Assets\nLandfill assets include the costs of landfill site acquisition, permits and cell design and construction incurred to date. Landfill cells represent individual disposal areas within the overall treatment and disposal site and may be subject to specific permit requirements in addition to the general permit requirements associated with the overall site.\nTo develop, construct and operate a landfill cell, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the landfill cell will be permitted.\nUpon receipt of regulatory approval, technical landfill cell designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill cell including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill cell.\nThe types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates at least annually. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill cell, including personnel costs of employees directly associated with the landfill cell design, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.\nTo match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill asset on a units-of-consumption basis over its operating life, typically on a cubic yard or cubic meter of disposal space consumed. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill cell's operating life. The per-unit amortization rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill cell, by the landfill cell's estimated remaining disposal capacity. Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill cell, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and valued them at the time of acquisition based on fair value.\nIncluded in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill cell. These factors include the area over which the landfill cell will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill cell elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. Landfill cell capacity used in the determination of amortization rates of our landfill assets includes both permitted and unpermitted disposal capacity. Unpermitted disposal capacity is included when management believes achieving final regulatory approval is probable based on our analysis of site conditions and interactions with applicable regulatory agencies.\nWe review the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill cell at least annually. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are developed using input from independent engineers and internal technical and accounting managers and are reviewed and approved by our environmental management group. Any changes in future estimated costs or estimated disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill cell amortization rates.\nWe assess our long-lived landfill assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate impairment of any of our landfill assets include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u00b7 Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements impacting the landfill site permitting process making it more difficult and costly to obtain and/or maintain a landfill permit; \n \u00b7 Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits, which could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit and adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of, or abandon, a project, which could result in an asset impairment; and \n \u00b7 Unexpected significant increases in estimated costs, significant reductions in prices we are able to charge our customers or reductions in disposal capacity that affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill. \nDisposal Facility Retirement Obligations\nDisposal facility retirement obligations include the cost to close, maintain and monitor landfill cells and support facilities. As individual landfill cells reach capacity, we must cap and close the cells in accordance with the landfill cell permits. These capping and closure requirements are detailed in the technical design of each landfill cell and included as part of our approved regulatory permit. After the entire landfill cell has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the landfill cell for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the landfill cell and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the landfill cell has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, transportation and disposal of landfill leachate, and erosion control costs related to the final cap.\nWe have a legally enforceable obligation to operate our landfill cells in accordance with the specific requirements, regulations and criteria set forth in our permits. This includes executing the approved closure/post-closure plan and closing/capping the entire landfill cell in accordance with the established requirements, design and criteria contained in the permit. As a result, we record the fair value of our disposal facility retirement obligations as a liability in the period in which the regulatory obligation to retire a specific asset is triggered. For our individual landfill cells, the required closure and post-closure obligations under the terms of our permits and our intended operation of the landfill cell are triggered and recorded when the cell is placed into service and waste is initially disposed in the landfill cell. The fair value is based on the total estimated costs to close the landfill cell and perform post-closure activities once the landfill cell has reached capacity and is no longer accepting waste, discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that is used to calculate the recorded liability, with accretion charged to direct operating costs. Actual cash expenditures to perform closure and post-closure activities reduce the retirement obligation liabilities as incurred. After initial measurement, asset retirement obligations are adjusted at the end of each period to reflect changes, if any, in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. Disposal facility retirement assets are capitalized as the related disposal facility retirement obligations are incurred. Disposal facility retirement assets are amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as the disposal capacity is consumed.\nOur disposal facility retirement obligations represent the present value of current cost estimates to close, maintain and monitor landfills and support facilities as described above. Cost estimates are developed using input from independent engineers, internal technical and accounting managers, as well as our environmental management group's interpretation of current legal and regulatory requirements, and are intended to approximate fair value. We estimate the timing of future payments based on expected annual disposal airspace consumption and then inflate the current cost estimate by an inflation rate, estimated at December 31, 2017 to be 2.6%. Inflated current costs are then discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, which approximates our incremental borrowing rate in effect at the time the obligation is established or when there are upward revisions to our estimated closure and post-closure costs. Our weighted-average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate at December 31, 2017 was approximately 5.9%. Final closure and post-closure obligations are currently estimated as being paid through the year 2105. During 2017 we updated several assumptions, including estimated costs and timing of closing our disposal cells. These updates resulted in a net decrease to our post-closure obligations of $352,000.\nWe update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill cell on an annual basis. Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of the required future activities to close, maintain and monitor landfills and facilities result in both: (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and\nrelated asset and (ii) a change in accretion and amortization rates which are applied prospectively over the remaining life of the asset. A hypothetical 1% increase in the inflation rate would increase our closure/post-closure obligation by $16.9 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in our cost estimates would increase our closure/post-closure obligation by $7.6 million.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's goodwill balance was $189.4 million. We assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter as of October 1 of each year, and also if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The assessment consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, including goodwill. Some of the factors that could indicate impairment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or failure to generate sufficient cash flows at the reporting unit. For example, field and industrial services represents an emerging business for the Company and has been the focus of a shift in strategy since the acquisition of EQ. Failure to execute on planned growth initiatives within this business could lead to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in future periods.\nWe determine our reporting units by identifying the components of each operating segment, and then aggregate components having similar economic characteristics based on quantitative and/or qualitative factors. At December 31, 2017, we had 14 reporting units, 8 of which had allocated goodwill.\nFair values are generally determined by using a market approach, applying a multiple of earnings based on guideline for publicly traded companies, an income approach, discounting projected future cash flows based on our expectations of the current and future operating environment, or a combination thereof. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. The rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry, capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired, and an impairment charge would be recognized during the period in which the determination has been made for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe result of the annual assessment of goodwill undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value, with the exception of the Resource Recovery reporting unit.\nOur Resource Recovery reporting unit offers full-service storm water management and propylene glycol ( PG\u201d) deicing fluid recovery at major airports. Recovered fluids are transported to our recycling facility in Romulus, Michigan where they are distilled and resold to industrial users. The Resource Recovery reporting unit also generates revenues from brokered PG sales and services revenues for PG collection at the airports we service. Weak PG commodity prices and reduced PG collection volumes at the airports we service negatively impacted the reporting unit's prospective financial information in its discounted cash flow model and the reporting unit's estimated fair value. A longer-than-expected recovery in PG commodity pricing and PG collection volumes became evident during the fourth quarter of 2017 as management completed its 2018 budgeting cycle and updated the long-term projections for the reporting unit which, as a result, decreased the reporting unit's anticipated future cash flows as compared to those estimated previously.\nThe estimated fair value of the Resource Recovery reporting unit was determined under an income approach using discounted projected future cash flows and then compared to the reporting unit's carrying amount as of October 1, 2017. Based on the results of that comparison, the carrying amount of the Resource Recovery reporting unit, including $5.5 million of goodwill, exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by more than $5.5 million and, as a result, we recognized a $5.5 million impairment charge, representing the reporting unit's entire goodwill balance, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe review intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment during the fourth quarter as of October 1 of each year. Fair value is generally determined by considering an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period in which the annual assessment occurs.\nThe result of the annual assessment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated no impairment charges were required, with the exception of the indefinite-lived intangible waste collection, recycling and resale permit associated with our Resource Recovery business.\nIn performing the annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test, the estimated fair value of the Resource Recovery business' waste collection, recycling and resale permit was determined under an income approach using discounted projected future cash flows associated with the permit and then compared to the $3.7 million carrying amount of the permit as of October 1, 2017. Based on the results of that evaluation, the carrying amount of the permit exceeded the estimated fair value of the permit and, as a result, we recognized a $3.4 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. The factors and timing contributing to the nonamortizing permit impairment charge were the same as the factors and timing described above with regards to the Resource Recovery reporting unit goodwill impairment charge.\nWe also review finite-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the assets' carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering: (i) the internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis; (ii) a third-party valuation; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period in which the events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable occurred.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed an assessment of the Resource Recovery business' finite-lived tangible and intangible assets, as events indicated their carrying values may not be recoverable. The result of the assessment indicated no impairment charges were required. Otherwise, no events or circumstances occurred during 2017 that would indicate that our finite-lived tangible and intangible assets may be impaired, therefore no other impairment tests were performed during 2017 other than the annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives conducted in the fourth quarter of every year.\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Allstate to a private investor group. Allstate represents the majority of the industrial services business we acquired with the acquisition of EQ. As a result of this agreement and management's strategic review, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with our industrial services business. Our interim goodwill impairment test which included both Step I and Step II analysis was performed and resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.7 million being recognized in the second quarter of 2015. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sale of Allstate.\nOur acquired permits and licenses generally have renewal terms of approximately 5-10 years. We have a history of renewing these permits and licenses as demonstrated by the fact that each of the sites' treatment permits and licenses have been renewed regularly since the facility began operations. We intend to continue to renew our permits and licenses as they come up for renewal for the foreseeable future. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of our permits and licenses are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare Based Payments\nOn May 27, 2015, our stockholders approved the Omnibus Incentive Plan ( Omnibus Plan\u201d), which was approved by our Board of Directors on April 7, 2015. The Omnibus Plan was developed to provide additional incentives through equity ownership in US Ecology and, as a result, encourage employees and directors to contribute to our success. The Omnibus Plan provides, among other things, the ability for the Company to grant restricted stock, performance stock, options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units ( PSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards or cash awards to officers, employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Subsequent to the approval of the Omnibus Plan in May 2015, we stopped granting equity awards under our 2008 Stock Option Incentive Plan and our 2006 Restricted Stock Plan ( Previous Plans\u201d), and the Previous Plans will remain in effect solely for the settlement of awards granted under the Previous Plans. No shares that are reserved but unissued under the Previous Plans or that are outstanding under the Previous Plans and reacquired by the Company for any reason will be available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. The Omnibus Plan expires on April 7, 2025 and authorizes 1,500,000 shares of common stock for grant over the life of the Omnibus Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have PSUs outstanding under the Omnibus Plan. Each PSU represents the right to receive, on the settlement date, one share of the Company's common stock. The total number of PSUs each participant is eligible to earn ranges from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs granted. The actual number of PSUs that will vest and be settled in shares is determined at the end of a three-year performance period, based on total stockholder return relative to a set of peer companies and the S&P 600. The fair value of the PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation of awards granted during 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have stock option awards outstanding under the 1992 Stock Option Plan for Employees ( 1992 Employee Plan\u201d) and the 2008 Stock Option Incentive Plan ( 2008 Stock Option Plan\u201d). Subsequent to the approval of the Omnibus Plan in May 2015, we stopped granting equity awards under the 2008 Stock Option Plan. The 2008 Stock Option Plan will remain in effect solely for the settlement of awards previously granted. In April 2013, the 1992 Employee Plan expired and was cancelled except for options then outstanding.\nThe determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected term of stock options and expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions utilized in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nThe Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach whereby we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for the likelihood of use in future periods. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance, if any, requires our judgment and the use of estimates. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we have deferred tax assets totaling approximately $15.9 million, a valuation allowance of $2.2 million and deferred tax liabilities totaling approximately $71.2 million.\nThe application of income tax law is inherently complex. Tax laws and regulations are voluminous and at times ambiguous and interpretations of guidance regarding such tax laws and regulations change over time. This requires us to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. A liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded in our financial statements on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position taken will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. As facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We recognize interest assessed by taxing authorities or interest associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense. We recognize any penalties assessed by taxing authorities or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company has calculated a provisional amount of the impact of the Tax Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and as a result has recorded $23.8 million as a net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional benefit amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was $25.2 million. The provisional expense amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $1.4 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $26.7 million.\nIn connection with the Tax Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined that the $25.2 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $1.4 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional amounts estimated based on information available as of December 31, 2017. These amounts are subject to change as we obtain information necessary to complete the calculations. Any subsequent adjustment to these provisional amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in 2018, when the analysis is complete. We expect to complete our analysis of the provisional items during the second half of 2018. The effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are being analyzed and are subject to change as additional information, guidance, and regulation becomes available.\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.\nLitigation\nWe have, in the past, been involved in litigation requiring estimates of timing and loss potential whose timing and ultimate disposition is controlled by the judicial process. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any ongoing, pending or threatened legal action that management believes, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The decision to accrue costs or write off assets is based on the pertinent facts and our evaluation of present circumstances.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or interests in variable interest entities that would require consolidation.
