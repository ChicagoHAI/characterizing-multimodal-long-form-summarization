Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business operations. Please read Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including the known material factors set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nSpin-Off\nOn May 30, 2014, Oil States International, Inc. (Oil States) spun-off its Accommodations Segment (Accommodations) into a standalone, publicly traded Delaware corporation (Civeo US). In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by Oil States distributing to its stockholders all 106,538,044 shares of common stock of Civeo US it held after the market closed on May 30, 2014 (the Spin-Off). In connection with the Spin-off, on May 28, 2014, we made a special cash distribution to Oil States of $750 million. Following the Spin-Off, Oil States retained no ownership interest in Civeo US, and each company now has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management.\nRedomiciling to Canada\nOn July 17, 2015, we completed our change in place of incorporation from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada (the Redomicile Transaction). In the Redomicile Transaction, Civeo Corporation, a British Columbia, Canada limited company formerly named Civeo Canadian Holdings ULC (Civeo Canada), became the publicly traded parent company of the Civeo group of companies, and our former publicly traded Delaware parent, Civeo US, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Civeo Canada. Each issued share of Civeo US common stock, other than those shares of Civeo US common stock held by Civeo US in treasury, was effectively transferred to Civeo Canada and converted into one common share, no par value, of Civeo Canada. An aggregate of approximately 107.5 million Civeo Canada common shares were issued in the Redomicile Transaction. The Civeo Canada common shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol CVEO,\u201d the same symbol under which the Civeo US common stock traded prior to the effective time.\nThe Redomicile Transaction qualified as a self-directed redomiciling\u201d of the Company as permitted under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. U.S. federal income tax laws permit a company to change its domicile to a foreign jurisdiction without corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes provided that such company has substantial business activity\u201d in the relevant jurisdiction. Substantial business activity\u201d is defined as foreign operations consisting of over 25% of the company's total (i) revenues, (ii) assets, (iii) employees and (iv) employee compensation. With approximately 50% or more of our operations in Canada based on these metrics, we qualified for a self-directed redomiciling.\nWe incurred costs related to the Redomicile Transaction totaling $1.3 million, $7.0 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDescription of the Business\nWe are one of the largest integrated providers of workforce accommodations, logistics and facility management services to the natural resource industry. Our scalable modular facilities provide long-term and temporary accommodations where traditional accommodations and related infrastructure is insufficient, inaccessible or not cost effective. Once facilities are deployed in the field, we also provide catering and food services, housekeeping, laundry, facility management, water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and redeployment logistics. Our accommodations support our customers' employees and contractors in the Canadian oil sands and in a variety of oil and natural gas drilling, mining and related natural resource applications as well as disaster relief efforts, primarily in Canada, Australia and the United States. We operate in three principal reportable business segments - Canada, Australia and U.S.\nBasis of Presentation\nUnless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in these consolidated financial statements to Civeo,\u201d the Company,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or we\u201d for the time period prior to the Spin-Off mean the Accommodations business of Oil States. For time periods after the Spin-Off, but prior to July 17, 2015, these terms refer to Civeo US and its consolidated subsidiaries. For time periods after July 17, 2015, these terms refer to Civeo Canada and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows consisted of the Oil States' Accommodations business and an allocable portion of its corporate costs, which represented a combined reporting entity. The combined financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-Off have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Oil States. The combined financial statements reflect our historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). The combined financial statements include certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Oil States corporate level, but are specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us.\nAll financial information presented after the Spin-Off represents the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Civeo. Accordingly:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity / net investment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist entirely of the consolidated results of Civeo.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity / net investment for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist of (i) the combined results of the Oil States' Accommodations business for the five months ended May 30, 2014 and (ii) the consolidated results of Civeo for the seven months ended December 31, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist entirely of the consolidated balances of Civeo.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements have been reflected on a historical basis, as immediately prior to the Spin-Off all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Oil States and were transferred within the Oil States consolidated group. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. All affiliate transactions between Civeo and Oil States have been included in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-Off included expense allocations for: (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Oil States, including, but not limited to finance, legal, risk management, tax, treasury, information technology, human resources, and certain other shared services, (2) certain employee benefits and incentives and (3) equity-based compensation. These expenses were allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on estimated time spent by Oil States personnel, a pro-rata basis of headcount or other relevant measures of Oil States and its subsidiaries. We consider the basis on which the expenses were allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense we would have incurred as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, which functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Following the Spin-Off, we perform these functions using our own resources or purchase external services. Until February 28, 2015, however, some of these functions were provided by Oil States under a transition services agreement. Please see Note 17 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nWe provide workforce accommodations to the natural resource industry in Canada, Australia and the U.S. Demand for our services can be attributed to two phases of our customers' projects: (1) the development or construction phase and (2) the operations or production phase. Initial demand for our services is driven by our customers' capital spending programs related to the construction and development of oil sands and coal mines and associated infrastructure as well as the exploration for oil and natural gas. Long-term demand for our services is driven by continued development and expansion of natural resource production and operation of oil sands and mining facilities. Industry capital spending programs are generally based on the outlook for commodity prices, economic growth and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expected commodity prices, principally related to crude oil, metallurgical (met) coal and natural gas.\nIn Canada, Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude is the benchmark price for our oil sands accommodations customers. Pricing for WCS is driven by several factors, including the underlying price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude and the availability of transportation infrastructure. Historically, WCS has traded at a discount to WTI, creating a WCS Differential,\u201d due to transportation costs and limited capacity to move Canadian heavy oil production to refineries, primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The WCS Differential has varied depending on the extent of transportation capacity availability.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, global oil prices dropped to their lowest level in over ten years due to concerns over global oil demand, global crude inventory levels, worldwide economic growth and price cutting by major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia. Increasing global supply, including increased U.S. shale oil production, also negatively impacted pricing. With falling Brent Crude and WTI oil prices, WCS also fell. Prices began to increase in March 2016, and have continued to increase in the first quarter of 2017. WCS prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 averaged $34.34 per barrel compared to a low of $20.26 in the first quarter of 2016 and a high of $83.78 in the second quarter of 2014. The WCS Differential increased from $13.25 per barrel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 to $16.10 per barrel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. As of February 20, 2017, the WTI price was $53.40 and the WCS price was $39.78, resulting in a WCS Differential of $13.62.\nThere remains a risk that prices for Canadian oil sands crude oil related products could deteriorate or remain at current depressed levels for an extended period of time, and the discount between WCS crude prices and WTI crude prices could widen. The depressed price levels through the first quarter of 2016 negatively impacted exploration, development, maintenance and production spending and activity by Canadian operators and, therefore, demand for our services in late 2014, 2015 and 2016. Our Canadian oil sands customers could continue to delay maintenance spending and additional investments in their oil sands assets as well.\nIn Australia, approximately 80% of our rooms are located in the Bowen Basin and primarily serve met coal mines in that region. Met coal pricing and growth in production in the Bowen Basin region is predominantly influenced by the levels of global steel production, which increased by 0.7% during 2016 compared to 2015. As of February 20, 2017, contract met coal prices were approximately $285 per metric tonne, significantly higher than the September 2016 contract price of $92.50 per metric tonne, due to supply side factors that have restricted met coal volumes. Despite the increase, we have not yet seen a significant impact on customers' willingness to increase activity. We expect that spot prices for met coal will need to be sustained at levels above $150 per metric tonne for at least nine to twelve months before we see an impact on customer activity levels, and therefore, the demand for accommodations. Long-term demand for steel will be driven by increased steel consumption per capita in developing economies, such as China and India, whose current consumption per capita is a fraction of developed countries. Our customers continue to actively implement cost, productivity and efficiency measures to drive down their cost base.\nNatural gas and WTI crude oil prices, discussed above, have an impact on the demand for our U.S. accommodations business. With limited export capabilities, U.S. natural gas prices are primarily influenced by domestic supply/demand dynamics and resultant inventory levels. U.S. natural gas production has continued to outpace demand, which has caused prices to continue to be weak relative to historical prices over the past decade. U.S. natural gas inventory levels at December 31, 2016 were 3.31 Tcf, 12% lower than inventory levels from December 31, 2015 and 1% under seasonally comparable average inventory levels over the past five years. Prices for natural gas in the U.S. averaged $2.55 per mcf in 2016, a 3% decrease from the average price in 2015. Although the prices have increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017, at these levels, it is uneconomic to increase development in several domestic, gas-focused basins. If natural gas production growth continues to surpass demand in the U.S. and/or the supply of natural gas were to increase, whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional production or associated natural gas production from oil wells, prices for natural gas could be constrained for an extended period and result in fewer rigs drilling for natural gas in the near-term.\nRecent WTI crude, WCS crude, met coal and natural gas pricing trends are as follows:\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Price (1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> WTI\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> WCS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Hard\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Henry Hub\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Crude\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Crude\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Coking Coal (Met Coal)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Natural Gas\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (per bbl)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (per bbl)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (per tonne)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (per mcf)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter through 2/20/2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>285.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9/30/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6/30/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3/31/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.98 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9/30/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6/30/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3/31/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9/30/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.95 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6/30/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3/31/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Source: WTI crude and natural gas prices are from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and WCS crude prices and Seaborne hard coking coal contract prices are from Bloomberg.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nAs noted above, demand for our services is primarily tied to the outlook for crude oil and met coal prices. Other factors that can affect our business and financial results include the general global economic environment and regulatory changes in Canada, Australia, the U.S. and other markets.\nOur business is predominantly located in northern Alberta, Canada and Queensland, Australia, and we derive most of our business from resource companies who are developing and producing oil sands and met coal resources and, to a lesser extent, other hydrocarbon and mineral resources. More than three-fourths of our revenue is generated by our large-scale lodge and village facilities. Where traditional accommodations and infrastructure are insufficient, inaccessible or cost ineffective, our lodge and village facilities provide comprehensive accommodations services similar to those found in an urban hotel. We typically contract our facilities to our customers on a fee per day basis that covers lodging and meals and that is based on the duration of their needs which can range from several weeks to several years.\nGenerally, our customers are making multi-billion dollar investments to develop their prospects, which have estimated reserve lives ranging from ten years to in excess of thirty years. Consequently, these investments are dependent on those customers' longer-term view of commodity demand and prices.\nIn response to decreases in crude oil prices beginning in late 2014, many of our customers in Canada curtailed their operations and spending, and most major oil sands mining operators are continuing to seek to reduce their costs and limit capital spending, accordingly limiting the demand for accommodations like we provide. In Australia, approximately 80% of our rooms are located in the Bowen Basin and primarily serve met coal mines in that region where our customers continue to actively implement cost productivity and efficiency measures to drive down their cost base.\nIn recent months, however, several catalysts have emerged that we believe could have favorable intermediate to long-term implications for our core end markets. Since the announcement by OPEC in late November 2016 to cut production quotas and the subsequent rise in oil prices and oil price expectations, certain operators with steam-assisted gravity drainage operations in the Canadian oil sands have announced increased capital budgets for 2017. In addition, the recent regulatory approval of major pipeline projects has the potential to both drive incremental demand for mobile accommodations assets and to improve take-away capacity for Canadian oil sands producers over the longer term. Additionally, we believe that the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S., if constructed, would be a positive catalyst for Canadian oil sands producers, as it would bolster confidence in future take-away capacity from the region to Gulf Coast refiners. In Australia, we believe prices are currently at a level that may contribute to increased activity over the longer term.\nWhile we believe that these macroeconomic developments are positive for our customers and for the underlying demand for the accommodations services we provide, we do not expect an immediate improvement in our business and are expecting our full year 2017 revenues and EBITDA to be materially lower compared to 2016. Accordingly, we plan to focus on enhancing the quality of our operations and maintaining financial discipline and to proactively manage our business as market conditions continue to evolve.\nWe began expansion of our room count in Kitimat, British Columbia during the second half of 2015 to support potential liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on the west coast of British Columbia. We were awarded a contract with LNG Canada (LNGC) for the provision of open lodge rooms and associated services that runs through September 2017. To support this contract, we have developed a new accommodations facility, named Sitka Lodge, which includes private washrooms, recreational facilities and other amenities. This lodge currently has 436 rooms, with the potential to expand to serve future accommodations demand in the region.\nIn addition, we were awarded a contract with LNGC to construct a 4,500 person workforce accommodation center (Cedar Valley Lodge) for a proposed liquefaction and export facility in Kitimat, British Columbia. Construction of Cedar Valley Lodge will not commence until LNGC's joint venture participants have made a positive final investment decision (FID). The FID was originally planned for the end of 2016; however, this decision has been delayed until a future time that has not yet been determined. We are currently in discussions with LNGC to extend this contract until a positive FID is made. Should the project ultimately move forward, British Columbia LNG activity could become a material driver of future activity for our Sitka Lodge, as well as for our mobile fleet assets which are well suited for the related pipeline construction activity. However, should the project, and other potential projects in the area, not move forward, the resulting impact may negatively affect our future results of operations and our existing long-lived assets in Canada, including our Sitka Lodge, and may require us to record further material impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of these assets over fair value. With the delay in the FID, we currently expect that LNGC will continue to utilize rooms at our Sitka Lodge through September 2017 in accordance with the terms of our contract. However, this contract may be extended to a new FID date based upon our current discussions with LNGC. There can be no assurance that LNGC's joint venture participants will reach a positive FID or that our contracts with LNGC will be extended.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator that certain asset groups used, or expected to be used, in conjunction with potential LNG projects in British Columbia may be impaired as a result of recent market developments, including the delay in FID discussed above. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of each of the asset groups to determine if they continued to be recoverable based on their estimated future cash flows. Based on the assessment, the carrying values of our mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in British Columbia were determined to not be recoverable, and an impairment charge totaling $37.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn estimating future cash flows, we made numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future and are therefore uncertain. These assumptions with respect to future circumstances included future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated customer spending, and industry and/or local market conditions. These assumptions represented our best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances. However, different assumptions could result in a determination that the carrying values of additional asset groups are no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows for certain of our assets included in this assessment that were not impaired were reduced by 10%, an additional impairment of between $25 million and $35 million could be indicated. Our estimate of fair value was primarily calculated using the Income Approach, which derives a present value of the asset group based on the asset groups estimated future cash flows. We discounted our estimated future cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns required by a market participant.\nWe expanded our Australian room capacity in 2012 and 2013 to meet increasing demand, notably in the Bowen Basin in Queensland and in the Gunnedah Basin in New South Wales to support coal production, and in Western Australia to support LNG and other energy-related projects. In early 2013, a confluence of falling met coal prices, additional carbon and mining taxes on our Australian customers and several years of cost inflation caused several of our customers to curtail or cease production from higher cost mines and delay or materially reduce their growth plans. This has negatively affected our ability to expand our room count and has led to a decrease in occupancy levels. With supply disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to Chinese production policy and Australian weather, the supply / demand balance in global met coal has improved. As a result, met coal prices have increased materially. We expect our Australian customers will wait for a stabilization in prices above $150/tonne before significantly increasing their spending, which may take nine months or longer.\nIf oil and coal prices decline from current levels, the resulting impact may negatively affect the value of our long-lived assets. Impairment expense of $46.1 million associated with long-lived assets was recorded in 2016. Impairment expense of $122.9 million was recorded in 2015, of which $79.7 million was associated with long-lived assets and the remaining $43.2 million was associated with goodwill. Impairment expense of $290.5 million was recorded in 2014, of which $87.8 million was associated with long-lived assets and the remaining $202.7 million was associated with goodwill.\nExchange rates between the U.S. dollar and each of the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar influence our U.S. dollar reported financial results. Our business has historically derived the vast majority of its revenues and operating income in Canada and Australia. These revenues and profits are translated into U.S. dollars for U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) financial reporting purposes. The Canadian dollar was valued at an average exchange rate of U.S. $0.76 for 2016 compared to U.S. $0.78 for 2015, a decrease of approximately 4%. The Canadian dollar was valued at an exchange rate of $0.74 on December 31, 2016 and $0.72 on December 31, 2015. The Australian dollar was valued at an average exchange rate of U.S. $0.74 for 2016 compared to U.S. $0.75 for 2015, a decrease of approximately 1%. The Australian dollar was valued at an exchange rate of $0.72 on December 31, 2016 and $0.73 on December 31, 2015. These fluctuations of the Canadian and Australian dollars have had and will continue to have an impact on the translation of earnings generated from our Canadian and Australian subsidiaries and, therefore, our financial results.\nWe continue to monitor the global economy, the demand for crude oil, met coal and natural gas and the resultant impact on the capital spending plans of our customers in order to plan our business. We currently expect that our 2017 capital expenditures, exclusive of any business acquisitions, will total approximately $15 million to $18 million, compared to 2016 capital expenditures of $19.8 million. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures.\nDuring January 2017, we closed a public offering of 23 million common shares. We expect to use the net proceeds of $64.9 million from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nResults of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated, discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is based on a comparison with the corresponding period of 2015 and 2014,

Consolidated revenues decreased $120.7 million, or 23%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decline was largely driven by decreases in Canada due to lower room rates, Australia and the U.S. due to lower occupancy, as well as weaker Canadian dollars in 2016 compared to 2015. Please see the discussion of segment results of operations below for further information.\nCost of Sales and Services. Our consolidated cost of sales decreased $68.0 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in occupancy in both Canada and Australia, as well as the weaker Canadian dollars in 2016 compared to 2015. Please see the discussion of segment results of operations below for further information.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expense decreased $13.1 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reduced compensation as a result of workforce reductions in 2016 and 2015, lower professional fees due to lower costs associated with the Redomicile Transaction, lower bad debt expense when compared to 2015, lower incentive compensation costs and the impact of the weaker Canadian dollars. These items were partially offset by higher share based compensation expense associated with phantom share awards. The increase in share based compensation was largely due to an increase in our share price during 2016. We use current market prices to remeasure these awards at each reporting date.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $21.7 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced depreciation expense resulting from impairments recorded in 2015, as well as the impact of the weaker Canadian dollars.\nImpairment Expense. Impairment expense of $46.1 million in 2016 consisted of:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pre-tax impairment losses of $37.7 million related to mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in the British Columbia LNG market in our Canadian segment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pre-tax impairment losses of $8.4 million related to the impairment of fixed assets in our U.S. segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment expense of $122.9 million in 2015 consisted of:\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pre-tax impairment losses of $33.5 million related to fixed assets in our Australian segment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pre-tax impairment totaling $2.7 million in 2015 related to a decision to sell our U.S. manufacturing facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Goodwill impairment losses of $43.2 million in our Canadian reporting unit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pre-tax impairment losses totaling $20.5 million associated with long-lived assets in our U.S. segment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pre-tax impairment losses totaling $23.0 million associated with long-lived assets in our Canadian segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for further discussion.\nOther Operating Expense (Income). Other operating expense (income) decreased from income of $9.0 million in 2015 to an expense of $0.6 million in 2016. The 2015 income was primarily due to foreign currency gains on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated cash in Canadian bank accounts, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nOperating Loss. Consolidated operating loss decreased $49.2 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower impairment expense in the 2016 period, partially offset by lower occupancy levels in Canada and Australia and the weaker Canadian dollars.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income, net. Net interest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from decreased interest income due to lower average cash balances in 2016 as compared to 2015 and lower capitalized interest in 2016. This was partially offset by decreased interest expense associated with lower amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility and the 2015 write-off of $1.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $20.1 million, or 17.3% of pre-tax income, compared to a benefit of $33.1 million, or 20.2% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was lower than the Canadian statutory rate of 27%, primarily due to losses in Australia and U.S. for which no tax benefit was recorded. As a result, a valuation allowance of $15.1 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nIn 2015, our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill charges, dividend income generated as part of a global restructuring, foreign tax credits, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded on a portion of our unremitted earnings of approximately $25.3 million and a valuation allowance of $11.2 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other comprehensive income increased $171.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments, due to changes in the Canadian and Australian dollar exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar increased 3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 compared to a 16% decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The Australian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 compared to a 11% decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations - Canadian Segment\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lodge revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,266 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mobile, open camp and product revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,519 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65,785 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales and services ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(39,835 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available lodge rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,218 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for lodges (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for lodges (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in lodges (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.028 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Average available rooms include rooms that are utilized for our personnel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Rentable rooms exclude rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out-of-service rooms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days.

The weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar by 4% in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted in a $10.6 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the weaker Canadian exchange rates, the segment experienced an 8% decline in lodge revenues, primarily due to lower room rates. This decline was partially mitigated by room needs related to the Fort McMurray fires. Finally, mobile, open camp and product revenues all declined due to overall lower activity levels.\nOur Canadian segment cost of sales and services decreased $39.8 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the decline in mobile and open camp activity, as well as a focus on cost containment and operational efficiencies. Additionally, the weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar resulted in reduced cost of sales.\nOur Canadian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 33% in 2015 to 31% in 2016, primarily due to lower contracted room rates, partially offset by room needs related to the Fort McMurray fires and lower costs due to a focus on cost containment and operational efficiencies.\nSegment Results of Operations - Australian Segment\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Village revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,149 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,149 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,897 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available village rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for villages (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(183 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for villages (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in Villages (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Australian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.008 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Average available rooms include rooms that are utilized for our personnel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Rentable rooms exclude rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out-of-service rooms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days.

Excluding the impact of the weaker Australian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 20% decline in revenues due to lower occupancy levels in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in mining activity.\nOur Australian segment cost of sales decreased $8.9 million, or 15%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by lower occupancy levels.\nOur Australian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 52% in 2016 from 55% in 2015. This was primarily driven by reduced revenues from take or pay contracts and lower occupancy compared to 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations - United States Segment\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,799 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,231 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.0 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur United States segment reported revenues in 2016 that were $25.8 million, or 68%, lower than 2015. The reduction was primarily due to continued lower U.S. drilling activity in the Bakken, Rockies and Texas markets and decreased sales in our offshore business.\nOur United States cost of sales decreased $19.2 million, or 53%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by overall lower activity levels.\nOur United States segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 4% in 2015 to (43%) in 2016, primarily due to overall lower activity levels, which were insufficient to cover the fixed cost structure of our United States segment.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31,

Consolidated revenues decreased $424.9 million, or 45%, in 2015 compared to 2014. This decline was largely driven by decreases in Canada and Australia, due to lower occupancy, as well as weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. Please see further description in the segment discussion below.\nCost of Sales and Services. Our consolidated cost of sales decreased $217.3 million, or 40%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to decreases in occupancy in both Canada and Australia, as well as the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. Please see further description in the segment discussion below.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expense decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Increased costs associated with being a publicly traded company for a full year and costs associated with the Redomicile Transaction of $7.0 million were more than offset by lower employee costs, as well as the impact of the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars.\nSpin-Off and Formation Costs. Spin-off and formation costs of $4.3 million relate to transition costs incurred during 2014 associated with becoming a stand-alone company.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $22.0 million, or 13%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to reduced depreciation expense resulting from impairments recorded in 2014 and 2015, as well as the impact of the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. These items were partially offset by capital expenditures made during 2014 largely related to investments in our Canadian segment.\nImpairment Expense.

Other operating expense (income) changed from an expense of $0.7 million in 2014 to income of $9.0 million in 2015. The 2015 income was primarily due to foreign currency gains on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated cash in Canadian bank accounts, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nOperating Loss. Consolidated operating loss increased $2.1 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower occupancy levels in Canada and Australia, as well as the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars, partially offset by lower impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income, net. Net interest expense, including interest expense and income to/from affiliates, increased by $1.1 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our new credit facility in 2015 and the 2015 write-off of $1.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility, partially offset by reduced interest expense in 2015 associated with the affiliate debt, which was eliminated as of the Spin-Off, as well as the 2014 write-off of $3.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the credit agreement that was terminated in conjunction with the Spin-Off. In addition, interest income decreased due to lower average cash balances in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $33.1 million, or 20.2% of pre-tax loss, compared to income tax expense of $31.4 million, or 20.1% of pre-tax loss, for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill charges, dividend income generated as part of a global restructuring, foreign tax credits, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded on a portion of our unremitted earnings of approximately $25.3 million and a valuation allowance of $11.2 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nPreviously, our effective tax rates were lower than U.S. statutory rates because of lower foreign income tax rates. However, in 2014, our income tax provision and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, a valuation allowance of approximately $51.4 million established against deferred tax assets in Australia that related to capital losses and were not expected to be realized and a deferred tax liability of $25.3 million related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings that we no longer intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest.\nOther Comprehensive Loss. Other comprehensive loss increased $29.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments due to changes in the Canadian and Australian dollar exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 16% in 2015 compared to an 8% decrease in 2014. The Australian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 11% in 2015 compared to an 8% decrease in 2014.\nSegment Results of Operations - Canadian Segment\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lodge revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>497,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(229,730 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mobile, open camp and product revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87,437 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>661,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(317,167 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales and services ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(171,469 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available lodge rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for lodges (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(953 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for lodges (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in lodges (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.123 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Average available rooms includes rooms that are utilized for our personnel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Rentable rooms excludes rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out of service rooms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days.

The weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar by 14% in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted in a $51.9 million year over year reduction in revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the weaker Canadian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 38% decline in lodge revenues, primarily due to reduced occupancy and lower room rates, partially offset by the opening of the McClelland Lake Lodge, which commenced operations in the summer of 2014. Mobile, open camp and product revenue decreased due to a reduced number of large projects during 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of weaker Canadian exchange rates, product sales were essentially flat year over year.\nOur Canadian segment cost of sales and services decreased $171.5 million, or 43%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower occupancy, as well as the weakening of the average exchange rates.\nOur Canadian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 39% in 2014 to 33% in 2015, primarily due to lower contracted room rates and occupancy in Canada.\nSegment Results of Operations - Australian Segment\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Village revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(77,315 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28,922 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available village rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for villages (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(217 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for villages (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in villages (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Australian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.150 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Average available rooms includes rooms that are utilized for our personnel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Rentable rooms excludes rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out of service rooms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days.

The weakening of the average exchange rates for Australian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar by 17% in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted in a $26.5 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. Excluding the impact of the weaker Australian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 19% decline in revenues due to lower occupancy levels in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in mining activity.\nOur Australian segment cost of sales decreased $28.9 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by the weakening of the Australian dollar, as well as lower occupancy levels.\nOur Australian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 55% in 2015 from 58% in 2014. This was primarily driven by reduced take or pay revenues on expired contracts compared to 2014.\nSegment Results of Operations - U.S. Segment\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,446 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,917 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur U.S. segment reported revenues in 2015 that were $30.4 million, or 45%, lower than 2014. The reduction was primarily due to lower U.S. drilling activity in the Bakken, Rockies and Texas markets and decreased sales in our offshore business.\nOur U.S. cost of sales decreased $16.9 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by overall lower activity levels, partially offset by a $1.1 million write-down of inventory at our U.S. manufacturing facility.\nOur U.S. segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 22% in 2014 to 4% in 2015, primarily due to the $1.1 million inventory write-down, as well as overall lower activity levels.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures, which in the past have included expanding and improving our accommodations, developing new lodges and villages, purchasing or leasing land under our land banking strategy, and for general working capital needs. In addition, capital has been used to repay debt, fund strategic business acquisitions and pay dividends. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been available cash, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from equity issuances. In addition, we may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity, fund acquisitions and refinance debt.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated liquidity position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lender commitments (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>350,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>375,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reductions in availability (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(144,803 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,690 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings against revolver capacity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,129 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,020 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outstanding letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,571 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,070 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused availability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,837 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total available liquidity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,057 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> In connection with the February 2017 amendment to the Amended Credit Facility, lender commitments were reduced to $275 million.

The decreases in operating cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014, respectively, primarily were due to lower revenue resulting from reduced rates and occupancy levels in lodges and villages. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities was $13.6 million during 2016 compared to net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $67.1 million during 2015 and $5.2 million during 2014. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a greater reduction in accounts receivable balances during 2015 than during 2016. The increase in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of decreased accounts receivable balances during 2015 compared to 2014.\nCash was used in investing activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014 in the amounts of $12.7 million, $49.8 million and $239.1 million respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $19.8 million, $62.5 million and $251.2 million respectively. Capital expenditures in 2016 consisted primarily of investments in an enterprise information system and maintenance. Capital expenditures in 2015 consisted principally of costs for the construction and installation of assets for our Sitka lodge in British Columbia and our Mariana Lake lodge in Alberta. Capital expenditures in 2014 consisted principally of construction and installation of assets for our lodges and villages primarily in support of Canadian oil sands projects, including the McClelland Lake Lodge in the Athabasca oil sands region, and Australian mining production and development projects. The significant decrease in capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily a result of the construction of the McClelland Lake Lodge, which was largely completed in 2014. No comparable project was under construction in 2015.\nWe expect our capital expenditures for 2017 to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million, which excludes any expenditures for unannounced and uncommitted projects, the spending for which is contingent on obtaining customer contracts. Whether planned expenditures will actually be spent in 2017 depends on industry conditions, project approvals and schedules, customer room commitments and project and construction timing. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with available cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility. The foregoing capital expenditure forecast does not include any funds for strategic acquisitions, which we could pursue depending on the economic environment in our industry and the availability of transactions at prices deemed to be attractive to us.\nThe table below delineates historical capital expenditures split between development spending on our lodges and villages, land banking spending, mobile and open camp spending and other capital expenditures. We classify capital expenditures for rooms and central facilities at our lodges and villages as development capital expenditures. Land banking spending consists of land acquisition and initial permitting or zoning costs. Other capital expenditures in the table below relate to routine capital spending for support equipment, upgrades to infrastructure at our lodge and village properties and spending related to our manufacturing facilities, among other items. We have also classified the expenditures between expansionary and maintenance spending.\nBased on management's judgment of capital spending classifications, we believe the following table represents the components of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Expansion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaint\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Expansion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaint\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nExpansion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maint\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lodge/village\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land banking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mobile/open camp\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelopment spending in 2015 was primarily related to the construction of our Sitka lodge in British Columbia and our Mariana Lake lodge in Alberta.

Net cash of $349.6 million was used in financing activities during 2015, primarily due to repayments of term loan borrowings of $729.4 million, offset by borrowings of term loans of $325 million and net revolver borrowings of $59.1 million. Net cash of $16.2 million was provided by financing activities during 2014, in part due to contributions from Oil States of $28.3 million. Borrowings of $775.0 million under our new term loan facility funded a cash distribution of $750.0 million to Oil States on May 28, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in debt outstanding during 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Canada\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAustralia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings on revolving credit facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments of revolving credit facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263,329 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,609 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,800 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(325,738 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments of term loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,023 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,023 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Translation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(330 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,929 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>326,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs in the coming 12 months. If our plans or assumptions change, or are inaccurate, or if we make acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. Acquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, an element of our business strategy. The timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable and uncertain. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with debt and/or equity issuances. Our ability to obtain capital for additional projects to implement our growth strategy over the longer term will depend upon our future operating performance, financial condition and, more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing. Capital availability will be affected by prevailing conditions in our industry, the global economy, the global financial markets and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, such additional debt service requirements could be based on higher interest rates and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to shareholders. In addition, in some cases, we may incur costs to acquire land and/or construct assets without securing a customer contract or prior to finalization of an accommodations contract with a customer. If the contract is not obtained or delayed, the resulting impact could result in an impairment of the related investment.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the offering of $300 million of common shares, preferred shares, debt securities and warrants. On February 7, 2017, we closed a public offering of 23,000,000 common shares at a price to the public of $3.00 per share. We expect to use the net proceeds of $64.9 million from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nCredit Facility and Long Term Debt\nOn February 17, 2017, the third amendment to the Amended Credit Facility became effective, which:\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Provide for the reduction by US$75 million of the aggregate revolving loan commitments under the Amended Credit Facility, to a maximum principal amount of $275 million.

Canadian dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to CDOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, or a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 4.50%, in each case based on a ratio of our consolidated total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). Australian dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to BBSY plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, based on a ratio of our consolidated total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility).\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict (i) subsidiary indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes, (ii) asset sales, (iii) margin stock, (iv) specified acquisitions, (v) restrictive agreements, (vi) transactions with affiliates and (vii) investments and other restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions. Specifically, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) to consolidated interest expense, of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 5.50 to 1.0 (as of December 31, 2016). As noted above, the permitted level of the maximum leverage ratio changes over time. Each of the factors considered in the calculations of these ratios are defined in the Amended Credit Facility. EBITDA and consolidated interest, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, exclude goodwill and asset impairments, debt discount amortization and other non-cash charges. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nBorrowings under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and all the assets of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are guaranteed by our significant subsidiaries. We have 15 lenders in our Amended Credit Facility with commitments ranging from $1.1 million to $116.5 million.\nDividends\nWe do not currently pay dividends. The declaration and amount of all potential future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in our Amended Credit Facility. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends, and we may incur incremental taxes in the U.S. if we are required to repatriate foreign earnings to pay such dividends. If we elect to pay dividends in the future, the amount per share of our dividend payments may be changed, or dividends may again be suspended, without advance notice. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of market weakness. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nEffects of Inflation\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation in the past three fiscal years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years (in thousands):\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>341,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligations - expected cash payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>473,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>372,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,532 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Interest payments due under the Amended Credit Facility, which matures on May 28, 2019; based on a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% to 5.2% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur debt obligations at December 31, 2016 are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, which is a part of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report. We have not entered into any material leases subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, thus impacting our reported results of operations and financial position. The critical accounting policies and estimates described in this section are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and the application of which requires management's most subjective judgments in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims. These liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts to cover an expected loss. Other claims or liabilities have been estimated based on their fair value or our experience in these matters and, when appropriate, the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts. Upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability. Examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities include litigation, taxes, interest, insurance claims, contract claims and obligations and asset retirement obligations.\nImpairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets, including Goodwill\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid for acquired businesses over the allocated fair value of the related net assets after impairments, if applicable. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, and we reduced the value of our goodwill to zero. Please see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report for further discussion of goodwill impairments recorded in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe do not amortize goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (the component\u201d level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at the component level. Each segment of our business represents a separate reporting unit, and all three of our reporting units previously had goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the reporting unit's implied fair value (IFV) of goodwill. We conduct our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.\nOur assessment consisted of a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compared each reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the IFV of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered impaired, and a second step was performed to determine the amount of impairment. Future impairment tests will be impacted by new accounting guidance which eliminates the second step of the goodwill impairment test.\nWe are given the option to test for impairment of our goodwill by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the currently prescribed two-step impairment test is unnecessary. In developing a qualitative assessment to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold, each reporting unit with goodwill is assessed separately and different relevant events and circumstances are evaluated for each unit. We have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2014, we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the first step of the impairment test. In performing the two-step impairment test, we compare each reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the IFV of the reporting unit. Because none of our reporting units has a publically quoted market price, we must determine the value that willing buyers and sellers would place on the reporting unit through a routine sale process (a Level 3 fair value measurement). In our analysis, we target an IFV that represents the value that would be placed on the reporting unit by market participants, and value the reporting unit based on historical and projected results throughout a cycle, not the value of the reporting unit based on trough or peak earnings. The IFV of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of (i) an analysis of trading multiples of comparable companies (Market Approach) and (ii) discounted projected cash flows (Income Approach). We also use acquisition multiples analyses in certain circumstances. The relative weighting of each approach varies by reporting unit, based on management's judgment.\nMarket Approach - This valuation approach utilizes publicly traded comparable companies' enterprise values, as compared to their recent and forecasted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) information. We have historically used an average EBITDA multiple ranging from approximately 6.5x to approximately 9.5x depending on the reporting unit. We use EBITDA because it is a widely used key indicator of the cash generating capacity of companies in our industry.\nIncome Approach - This valuation approach derives a present value of the reporting unit's projected future annual cash flows over the next five years. We use a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows, including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions, rates, occupancy levels, costs and expenses and capital expenditures. These assumptions vary by each reporting unit depending on market conditions. In addition, a terminal value is estimated, using a Gordon Growth methodology with a long-term growth rate of 3%. We discount our projected cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns that would be required by a market participant.\nThe IFV of our reporting units is affected by future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated spending by our customers and the cost of capital. Our estimate of IFV requires us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances, such as industry and/or local market conditions that might directly impact each reporting unit's operations in the future, and are therefore uncertain. We selected these valuation approaches because we believe the combination of these approaches and our best judgment regarding underlying assumptions and estimates provides us with the best estimate of fair value for each of our reporting units. We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and widely accepted by investors. The IFV of each reporting unit would change if our assumptions under these valuation approaches, or relative weighting of the valuation approaches, were materially modified.\nDefinite-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets. The recoverability of the carrying values of tangible and intangible assets is assessed at an asset group level which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Whenever, in management's judgment, events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset groups may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows, an asset impairment evaluation is performed. Indicators of impairment might include persistent negative economic trends affecting the markets we serve, recurring losses or lowered expectations of future cash flows expected to be generated by our assets.\nIn performing this analysis, the first step is to compare each asset group's carrying value to estimates of undiscounted future cash flows. We use a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows, including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions, rates, occupancy levels, costs and expenses and capital expenditures. The estimates are consistent with those used for purposes of our goodwill impairment test, as further discussed in Goodwill, above.\nIf, based on the assessment, the carrying values of any of our asset groups are determined to not be recoverable, we proceed to the second step. In this step, we compare the fair value of the respective asset group to its carrying value. Our estimate of the fair value requires us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances, such as industry and/or local market conditions that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future, and are therefore uncertain.\nOur industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated, as well as the predictability of these cash flows and our determination of whether a decline in value of our investment has occurred, can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and, in periods of prolonged down cycles, may result in impairment losses. If this assessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset group. The fair value of the asset group is based on prices of similar assets, if available, or discounted cash flows.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator that certain asset groups used, or expected to be used, in conjunction with potential LNG projects in British Columbia may be impaired as a result of recent market developments, including the delay in FID discussed above. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of each of the asset groups to determine if they continued to be recoverable based on their estimated future cash flows. Based on the assessment, the carrying values of our mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in British Columbia were determined to not be recoverable, and an impairment charge totaling $37.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn estimating future cash flows, we made numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future and are therefore uncertain. These assumptions with respect to future circumstances included future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated customer spending, and industry and/or local market conditions. These assumptions represented our best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances. However, different assumptions could result in a determination that the carrying values of additional asset groups are no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows for certain of our assets included in this assessment that were not impaired were reduced by 10%, an additional impairment of between $25 million and $35 million could be indicated. Our estimate of fair value was primarily calculated using the Income Approach, which derives a present value of the asset group based on the asset groups' estimated future cash flows. We discounted our estimated future cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns required by a market participant.\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impairments of definite-lived tangible and intangible assets recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. We are required to evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In performing the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. The measurement of the impairment is calculated based on the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues are recognized based on a periodic (usually daily) room rate or when the services are rendered. Revenues are recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of our contractual relationships with our customers. In some contracts, the rate or committed room numbers may vary over the contract term. In these cases, revenue may be deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Revenue from the sale of products, not accounted for utilizing the percentage-of-completion method, is recognized when delivery to and acceptance by the customer has occurred, when title and all significant risks of ownership have passed to the customer, collectability is probable and pricing is fixed and determinable. Our product sales terms do not include significant post-delivery obligations.\nFor significant projects, revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Billings on such contracts in excess of costs incurred and estimated profits are classified as deferred revenue. Costs incurred and estimated profits in excess of billings on percentage-of-completion contracts are recognized as unbilled receivables. Our management believes this method is the most appropriate measure of progress on large contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to projected costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of our estimates and materially impact our future reported earnings.\nRevenues exclude taxes assessed based on revenues such as sales or value added taxes.\nCost of services includes labor, food, utilities, cleaning supplies and other costs associated with operating the accommodations facilities. Cost of goods sold includes all direct material and labor costs and those costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nEstimation of Useful Lives\nThe selection of the useful lives of many of our assets requires the judgments of our operating personnel as to the length of these useful lives. Our judgment in this area is influenced by our historical experience in operating our assets, technological developments and expectations of future demand for the assets. Should our estimates be too long or short, we might eventually report a disproportionate number of losses or gains upon disposition or retirement of our long-lived assets. We reevaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our assets when certain events occur that directly impact the useful lives and salvage values, including changes in operating condition, functional capability and market and economic factors. We believe our estimates of useful lives are appropriate.\nShare-Based Compensation\nOur historic share-based compensation is based on participating in Civeo's 2014 Equity Participation Plan and, prior to the Spin-Off, the Oil States 2001 Equity Participation Plan (collectively, the Plans). Our disclosures reflect only our employees' participation in the Plans. We are required to estimate the fair value of share compensation made pursuant to awards under the Plans. An initial estimate of the fair value of each option award or restricted share award determines the amount of share compensation expense we will recognize in the future. For stock option awards prior to the Spin-Off, to estimate the value of the awards under the Plan, Oil States selected a fair value calculation model. Oil States chose the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options awarded under the Plan. Oil States chose this model because option awards were made under straightforward vesting terms, option prices and option lives. Utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model required Oil States to estimate the length of time options will remain outstanding, a risk free interest rate for the estimated period options are assumed to be outstanding, forfeiture rates, future dividends and the volatility of our common stock. All of these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future share-based compensation expense recognition. We have not made any option awards subsequent to the Spin-Off, but, in the event that we make future awards, we expect to utilize a similar valuation methodology. We will continually monitor our actual experience and change assumptions for future awards as we consider appropriate.\nWe also grant performance awards under the Civeo Plan. Awards granted in 2016 will be earned in amounts between 0% and 200% of the participant's target performance share award, based on the payout percentage associated with Civeo's relative total shareholder return rank among a peer group of 12 other companies. The fair value of the 2016 awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. We chose this model because the performance awards contain complex vesting terms. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model required us to estimate the risk-free interest rate and the expected market price volatility of our common shares as well as a peer group of companies over a time period equal to the expected term of the award, The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period. For additional details, see Note 15 - Share Based Compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with current accounting standards regarding the accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect at the time the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.\nWhen our earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for Canadian income taxes is made for these earnings. If any of the subsidiaries have a distribution of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both Canadian income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our U.S. foreign subsidiary companies, and recognized a deferred tax liability of $25.3 million as of December 31, 2014 related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings. During the third quarter of 2015, following our redomiciliation to Canada, we determined that the existing deferred tax liability recorded was no longer required. We reversed the deferred tax liability and recorded a tax benefit of approximately $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We do not expect to provide Canadian income taxes on future foreign earnings.\nWe record a valuation allowance in each reporting period when our management believes that it is more likely than not that any recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our management will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation allowance in the future, based upon our operating results. Please see Note 12 - Income Taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we are required to estimate a liability for future income taxes for any uncertainty for potential income tax exposures. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.\nFor periods prior to the Spin-Off, our results were included in the consolidated tax return of Oil States. We have determined our U.S. income taxes in the combined financial statements by assuming our results are excluded from the consolidated return and then comparing consolidated taxable income and taxes due with and then without our results. Canadian and Australian taxes are based on actual tax returns filed by our foreign subsidiaries.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Please see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business operations.

(Oil States) spun-off its Accommodations Segment (Accommodations) into a standalone, publicly traded Delaware corporation (Civeo US). In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by Oil States distributing to its stockholders all 106,538,044 shares of common stock of Civeo US it held after the market closed on May 30, 2014 (the Spin-Off). In connection with the Spin-off, on May 28, 2014, we made a special cash distribution to Oil States of $750 million. Following the Spin-Off, Oil States retained no ownership interest in Civeo US, and each company now has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management.\nRedomiciling to Canada\nOn July 17, 2015, we completed our change in place of incorporation from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada (the Redomicile Transaction). In the Redomicile Transaction, Civeo Corporation, a British Columbia, Canada limited company formerly named Civeo Canadian Holdings ULC (Civeo Canada), became the publicly traded parent company of the Civeo group of companies, and our former publicly traded Delaware parent, Civeo US, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Civeo Canada. Each issued share of Civeo US common stock, other than those shares of Civeo US common stock held by Civeo US in treasury, was effectively transferred to Civeo Canada and converted into one common share, no par value, of Civeo Canada. An aggregate of approximately 107.5 million Civeo Canada common shares were issued in the Redomicile Transaction. The Civeo Canada common shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol CVEO,\u201d the same symbol under which the Civeo US common stock traded prior to the effective time.\nThe Redomicile Transaction qualified as a self-directed redomiciling\u201d of the Company as permitted under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. U.S. federal income tax laws permit a company to change its domicile to a foreign jurisdiction without corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes provided that such company has substantial business activity\u201d in the relevant jurisdiction. Substantial business activity\u201d is defined as foreign operations consisting of over 25% of the company's total (i) revenues, (ii) assets, (iii) employees and (iv) employee compensation. With approximately 50% or more of our operations in Canada based on these metrics, we qualified for a self-directed redomiciling.\nWe incurred costs related to the Redomicile Transaction totaling $1.3 million, $7.0 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDescription of the Business\nWe are one of the largest integrated providers of workforce accommodations, logistics and facility management services to the natural resource industry. Our scalable modular facilities provide long-term and temporary accommodations where traditional accommodations and related infrastructure is insufficient, inaccessible or not cost effective. Once facilities are deployed in the field, we also provide catering and food services, housekeeping, laundry, facility management, water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and redeployment logistics. Our accommodations support our customers' employees and contractors in the Canadian oil sands and in a variety of oil and natural gas drilling, mining and related natural resource applications as well as disaster relief efforts, primarily in Canada, Australia and the United States. We operate in three principal reportable business segments - Canada, Australia and U.S.\nBasis of Presentation\nUnless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in these consolidated financial statements to Civeo,\u201d the Company,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or we\u201d for the time period prior to the Spin-Off mean the Accommodations business of Oil States. For time periods after the Spin-Off, but prior to July 17, 2015, these terms refer to Civeo US and its consolidated subsidiaries. For time periods after July 17, 2015, these terms refer to Civeo Canada and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows consisted of the Oil States' Accommodations business and an allocable portion of its corporate costs, which represented a combined reporting entity. The combined financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-Off have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Oil States. The combined financial statements reflect our historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). The combined financial statements include certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Oil States corporate level, but are specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us.\nAll financial information presented after the Spin-Off represents the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Civeo. Accordingly:\n \u25cf Our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity / net investment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist entirely of the consolidated results of Civeo. \n \u25cf Our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity / net investment for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist of (i) the combined results of the Oil States' Accommodations business for the five months ended May 30, 2014 and (ii) the consolidated results of Civeo for the seven months ended December 31, 2014. \n \u25cf Our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist entirely of the consolidated balances of Civeo. \nThe assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements have been reflected on a historical basis, as immediately prior to the Spin-Off all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Oil States and were transferred within the Oil States consolidated group. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. All affiliate transactions between Civeo and Oil States have been included in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-Off included expense allocations for: (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Oil States, including, but not limited to finance, legal, risk management, tax, treasury, information technology, human resources, and certain other shared services, (2) certain employee benefits and incentives and (3) equity-based compensation. These expenses were allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on estimated time spent by Oil States personnel, a pro-rata basis of headcount or other relevant measures of Oil States and its subsidiaries. We consider the basis on which the expenses were allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense we would have incurred as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, which functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Following the Spin-Off, we perform these functions using our own resources or purchase external services. Until February 28, 2015, however, some of these functions were provided by Oil States under a transition services agreement. Please see Note 17 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nWe provide workforce accommodations to the natural resource industry in Canada, Australia and the U.S. Demand for our services can be attributed to two phases of our customers' projects: (1) the development or construction phase and (2) the operations or production phase. Initial demand for our services is driven by our customers' capital spending programs related to the construction and development of oil sands and coal mines and associated infrastructure as well as the exploration for oil and natural gas. Long-term demand for our services is driven by continued development and expansion of natural resource production and operation of oil sands and mining facilities. Industry capital spending programs are generally based on the outlook for commodity prices, economic growth and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expected commodity prices, principally related to crude oil, metallurgical (met) coal and natural gas.\nIn Canada, Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude is the benchmark price for our oil sands accommodations customers. Pricing for WCS is driven by several factors, including the underlying price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude and the availability of transportation infrastructure. Historically, WCS has traded at a discount to WTI, creating a WCS Differential,\u201d due to transportation costs and limited capacity to move Canadian heavy oil production to refineries, primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The WCS Differential has varied depending on the extent of transportation capacity availability.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, global oil prices dropped to their lowest level in over ten years due to concerns over global oil demand, global crude inventory levels, worldwide economic growth and price cutting by major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia. Increasing global supply, including increased U.S. shale oil production, also negatively impacted pricing. With falling Brent Crude and WTI oil prices, WCS also fell. Prices began to increase in March 2016, and have continued to increase in the first quarter of 2017. WCS prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 averaged $34.34 per barrel compared to a low of $20.26 in the first quarter of 2016 and a high of $83.78 in the second quarter of 2014. The WCS Differential increased from $13.25 per barrel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 to $16.10 per barrel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. As of February 20, 2017, the WTI price was $53.40 and the WCS price was $39.78, resulting in a WCS Differential of $13.62.\nThere remains a risk that prices for Canadian oil sands crude oil related products could deteriorate or remain at current depressed levels for an extended period of time, and the discount between WCS crude prices and WTI crude prices could widen. The depressed price levels through the first quarter of 2016 negatively impacted exploration, development, maintenance and production spending and activity by Canadian operators and, therefore, demand for our services in late 2014, 2015 and 2016. Our Canadian oil sands customers could continue to delay maintenance spending and additional investments in their oil sands assets as well.\nIn Australia, approximately 80% of our rooms are located in the Bowen Basin and primarily serve met coal mines in that region. Met coal pricing and growth in production in the Bowen Basin region is predominantly influenced by the levels of global steel production, which increased by 0.7% during 2016 compared to 2015. As of February 20, 2017, contract met coal prices were approximately $285 per metric tonne, significantly higher than the September 2016 contract price of $92.50 per metric tonne, due to supply side factors that have restricted met coal volumes. Despite the increase, we have not yet seen a significant impact on customers' willingness to increase activity. We expect that spot prices for met coal will need to be sustained at levels above $150 per metric tonne for at least nine to twelve months before we see an impact on customer activity levels, and therefore, the demand for accommodations. Long-term demand for steel will be driven by increased steel consumption per capita in developing economies, such as China and India, whose current consumption per capita is a fraction of developed countries. Our customers continue to actively implement cost, productivity and efficiency measures to drive down their cost base.\nNatural gas and WTI crude oil prices, discussed above, have an impact on the demand for our U.S. accommodations business. With limited export capabilities, U.S. natural gas prices are primarily influenced by domestic supply/demand dynamics and resultant inventory levels. U.S. natural gas production has continued to outpace demand, which has caused prices to continue to be weak relative to historical prices over the past decade. U.S. natural gas inventory levels at December 31, 2016 were 3.31 Tcf, 12% lower than inventory levels from December 31, 2015 and 1% under seasonally comparable average inventory levels over the past five years. Prices for natural gas in the U.S. averaged $2.55 per mcf in 2016, a 3% decrease from the average price in 2015. Although the prices have increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017, at these levels, it is uneconomic to increase development in several domestic, gas-focused basins. If natural gas production growth continues to surpass demand in the U.S. and/or the supply of natural gas were to increase, whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional production or associated natural gas production from oil wells, prices for natural gas could be constrained for an extended period and result in fewer rigs drilling for natural gas in the near-term.\nRecent WTI crude, WCS crude, met coal and natural gas pricing trends are as follows:\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Price (1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> WTI\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> WCS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Hard\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Henry Hub\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Crude\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Crude\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Coking Coal (Met Coal)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Natural Gas\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (per bbl)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (per bbl)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (per tonne)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (per mcf)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter through 2/20/2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>285.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9/30/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6/30/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3/31/2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.98 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9/30/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6/30/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3/31/2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9/30/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.95 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6/30/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3/31/2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/31/2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n (1) Source: WTI crude and natural gas prices are from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and WCS crude prices and Seaborne hard coking coal contract prices are from Bloomberg. \nOverview\nAs noted above, demand for our services is primarily tied to the outlook for crude oil and met coal prices. Other factors that can affect our business and financial results include the general global economic environment and regulatory changes in Canada, Australia, the U.S. and other markets.\nOur business is predominantly located in northern Alberta, Canada and Queensland, Australia, and we derive most of our business from resource companies who are developing and producing oil sands and met coal resources and, to a lesser extent, other hydrocarbon and mineral resources. More than three-fourths of our revenue is generated by our large-scale lodge and village facilities. Where traditional accommodations and infrastructure are insufficient, inaccessible or cost ineffective, our lodge and village facilities provide comprehensive accommodations services similar to those found in an urban hotel. We typically contract our facilities to our customers on a fee per day basis that covers lodging and meals and that is based on the duration of their needs which can range from several weeks to several years.\nGenerally, our customers are making multi-billion dollar investments to develop their prospects, which have estimated reserve lives ranging from ten years to in excess of thirty years. Consequently, these investments are dependent on those customers' longer-term view of commodity demand and prices.\nIn response to decreases in crude oil prices beginning in late 2014, many of our customers in Canada curtailed their operations and spending, and most major oil sands mining operators are continuing to seek to reduce their costs and limit capital spending, accordingly limiting the demand for accommodations like we provide. In Australia, approximately 80% of our rooms are located in the Bowen Basin and primarily serve met coal mines in that region where our customers continue to actively implement cost productivity and efficiency measures to drive down their cost base.\nIn recent months, however, several catalysts have emerged that we believe could have favorable intermediate to long-term implications for our core end markets. Since the announcement by OPEC in late November 2016 to cut production quotas and the subsequent rise in oil prices and oil price expectations, certain operators with steam-assisted gravity drainage operations in the Canadian oil sands have announced increased capital budgets for 2017. In addition, the recent regulatory approval of major pipeline projects has the potential to both drive incremental demand for mobile accommodations assets and to improve take-away capacity for Canadian oil sands producers over the longer term. Additionally, we believe that the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S., if constructed, would be a positive catalyst for Canadian oil sands producers, as it would bolster confidence in future take-away capacity from the region to Gulf Coast refiners. In Australia, we believe prices are currently at a level that may contribute to increased activity over the longer term.\nWhile we believe that these macroeconomic developments are positive for our customers and for the underlying demand for the accommodations services we provide, we do not expect an immediate improvement in our business and are expecting our full year 2017 revenues and EBITDA to be materially lower compared to 2016. Accordingly, we plan to focus on enhancing the quality of our operations and maintaining financial discipline and to proactively manage our business as market conditions continue to evolve.\nWe began expansion of our room count in Kitimat, British Columbia during the second half of 2015 to support potential liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on the west coast of British Columbia. We were awarded a contract with LNG Canada (LNGC) for the provision of open lodge rooms and associated services that runs through September 2017. To support this contract, we have developed a new accommodations facility, named Sitka Lodge, which includes private washrooms, recreational facilities and other amenities. This lodge currently has 436 rooms, with the potential to expand to serve future accommodations demand in the region.\nIn addition, we were awarded a contract with LNGC to construct a 4,500 person workforce accommodation center (Cedar Valley Lodge) for a proposed liquefaction and export facility in Kitimat, British Columbia. Construction of Cedar Valley Lodge will not commence until LNGC's joint venture participants have made a positive final investment decision (FID). The FID was originally planned for the end of 2016; however, this decision has been delayed until a future time that has not yet been determined. We are currently in discussions with LNGC to extend this contract until a positive FID is made. Should the project ultimately move forward, British Columbia LNG activity could become a material driver of future activity for our Sitka Lodge, as well as for our mobile fleet assets which are well suited for the related pipeline construction activity. However, should the project, and other potential projects in the area, not move forward, the resulting impact may negatively affect our future results of operations and our existing long-lived assets in Canada, including our Sitka Lodge, and may require us to record further material impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of these assets over fair value. With the delay in the FID, we currently expect that LNGC will continue to utilize rooms at our Sitka Lodge through September 2017 in accordance with the terms of our contract. However, this contract may be extended to a new FID date based upon our current discussions with LNGC. There can be no assurance that LNGC's joint venture participants will reach a positive FID or that our contracts with LNGC will be extended.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator that certain asset groups used, or expected to be used, in conjunction with potential LNG projects in British Columbia may be impaired as a result of recent market developments, including the delay in FID discussed above. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of each of the asset groups to determine if they continued to be recoverable based on their estimated future cash flows. Based on the assessment, the carrying values of our mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in British Columbia were determined to not be recoverable, and an impairment charge totaling $37.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn estimating future cash flows, we made numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future and are therefore uncertain. These assumptions with respect to future circumstances included future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated customer spending, and industry and/or local market conditions. These assumptions represented our best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances. However, different assumptions could result in a determination that the carrying values of additional asset groups are no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows for certain of our assets included in this assessment that were not impaired were reduced by 10%, an additional impairment of between $25 million and $35 million could be indicated. Our estimate of fair value was primarily calculated using the Income Approach, which derives a present value of the asset group based on the asset groups estimated future cash flows. We discounted our estimated future cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns required by a market participant.\nWe expanded our Australian room capacity in 2012 and 2013 to meet increasing demand, notably in the Bowen Basin in Queensland and in the Gunnedah Basin in New South Wales to support coal production, and in Western Australia to support LNG and other energy-related projects. In early 2013, a confluence of falling met coal prices, additional carbon and mining taxes on our Australian customers and several years of cost inflation caused several of our customers to curtail or cease production from higher cost mines and delay or materially reduce their growth plans. This has negatively affected our ability to expand our room count and has led to a decrease in occupancy levels. With supply disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to Chinese production policy and Australian weather, the supply / demand balance in global met coal has improved. As a result, met coal prices have increased materially. We expect our Australian customers will wait for a stabilization in prices above $150/tonne before significantly increasing their spending, which may take nine months or longer.\nIf oil and coal prices decline from current levels, the resulting impact may negatively affect the value of our long-lived assets. Impairment expense of $46.1 million associated with long-lived assets was recorded in 2016. Impairment expense of $122.9 million was recorded in 2015, of which $79.7 million was associated with long-lived assets and the remaining $43.2 million was associated with goodwill. Impairment expense of $290.5 million was recorded in 2014, of which $87.8 million was associated with long-lived assets and the remaining $202.7 million was associated with goodwill.\nExchange rates between the U.S. dollar and each of the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar influence our U.S. dollar reported financial results. Our business has historically derived the vast majority of its revenues and operating income in Canada and Australia. These revenues and profits are translated into U.S. dollars for U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) financial reporting purposes. The Canadian dollar was valued at an average exchange rate of U.S. $0.76 for 2016 compared to U.S. $0.78 for 2015, a decrease of approximately 4%. The Canadian dollar was valued at an exchange rate of $0.74 on December 31, 2016 and $0.72 on December 31, 2015. The Australian dollar was valued at an average exchange rate of U.S. $0.74 for 2016 compared to U.S. $0.75 for 2015, a decrease of approximately 1%. The Australian dollar was valued at an exchange rate of $0.72 on December 31, 2016 and $0.73 on December 31, 2015. These fluctuations of the Canadian and Australian dollars have had and will continue to have an impact on the translation of earnings generated from our Canadian and Australian subsidiaries and, therefore, our financial results.\nWe continue to monitor the global economy, the demand for crude oil, met coal and natural gas and the resultant impact on the capital spending plans of our customers in order to plan our business. We currently expect that our 2017 capital expenditures, exclusive of any business acquisitions, will total approximately $15 million to $18 million, compared to 2016 capital expenditures of $19.8 million. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures.\nDuring January 2017, we closed a public offering of 23 million common shares. We expect to use the net proceeds of $64.9 million from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nResults of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated, discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is based on a comparison with the corresponding period of 2015 and 2014,

reported net loss attributable to Civeo for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $96.4 million, or $0.90 per diluted share. As further discussed below, net loss included (i) a $46.1 million pre-tax loss ($35.9 million after-tax, or $0.34 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of fixed assets, included in Impairment expense, and (ii) a $1.3 million pre-tax loss ($1.2 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) from costs incurred in connection with the Redomicile Transaction, included in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense below.\nWe reported net loss attributable to Civeo for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $131.8 million, or $1.24 per diluted share. As further discussed below, net loss included the following items:\n \u25cf an $80.7 million pre-tax loss ($56.0 million after-tax, or $0.52 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $43.2 million pre-tax loss ($43.2 million after-tax, or $0.40 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of goodwill in our Canadian reporting unit, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $7.0 million pre-tax loss ($4.6 million after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from costs incurred in connection with the Redomicile Transaction, included in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense below; and \n \u25cf a $1.5 million pre-tax loss ($1.5 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) from the write off of debt issuance costs, included in Interest expense and income, net below. \nRevenues. Consolidated revenues decreased $120.7 million, or 23%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decline was largely driven by decreases in Canada due to lower room rates, Australia and the U.S. due to lower occupancy, as well as weaker Canadian dollars in 2016 compared to 2015. Please see the discussion of segment results of operations below for further information.\nCost of Sales and Services. Our consolidated cost of sales decreased $68.0 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in occupancy in both Canada and Australia, as well as the weaker Canadian dollars in 2016 compared to 2015. Please see the discussion of segment results of operations below for further information.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expense decreased $13.1 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reduced compensation as a result of workforce reductions in 2016 and 2015, lower professional fees due to lower costs associated with the Redomicile Transaction, lower bad debt expense when compared to 2015, lower incentive compensation costs and the impact of the weaker Canadian dollars. These items were partially offset by higher share based compensation expense associated with phantom share awards. The increase in share based compensation was largely due to an increase in our share price during 2016. We use current market prices to remeasure these awards at each reporting date.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $21.7 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced depreciation expense resulting from impairments recorded in 2015, as well as the impact of the weaker Canadian dollars.\nImpairment Expense. Impairment expense of $46.1 million in 2016 consisted of:\n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $37.7 million related to mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in the British Columbia LNG market in our Canadian segment; and \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $8.4 million related to the impairment of fixed assets in our U.S. segment. \nImpairment expense of $122.9 million in 2015 consisted of:\n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $33.5 million related to fixed assets in our Australian segment; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment totaling $2.7 million in 2015 related to a decision to sell our U.S. manufacturing facility; \n \u25cf Goodwill impairment losses of $43.2 million in our Canadian reporting unit; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses totaling $20.5 million associated with long-lived assets in our U.S. segment; and \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses totaling $23.0 million associated with long-lived assets in our Canadian segment. \nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for further discussion.\nOther Operating Expense (Income). Other operating expense (income) decreased from income of $9.0 million in 2015 to an expense of $0.6 million in 2016. The 2015 income was primarily due to foreign currency gains on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated cash in Canadian bank accounts, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nOperating Loss. Consolidated operating loss decreased $49.2 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower impairment expense in the 2016 period, partially offset by lower occupancy levels in Canada and Australia and the weaker Canadian dollars.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income, net. Net interest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from decreased interest income due to lower average cash balances in 2016 as compared to 2015 and lower capitalized interest in 2016. This was partially offset by decreased interest expense associated with lower amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility and the 2015 write-off of $1.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $20.1 million, or 17.3% of pre-tax income, compared to a benefit of $33.1 million, or 20.2% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was lower than the Canadian statutory rate of 27%, primarily due to losses in Australia and U.S. for which no tax benefit was recorded. As a result, a valuation allowance of $15.1 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nIn 2015, our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill charges, dividend income generated as part of a global restructuring, foreign tax credits, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded on a portion of our unremitted earnings of approximately $25.3 million and a valuation allowance of $11.2 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other comprehensive income increased $171.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments, due to changes in the Canadian and Australian dollar exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar increased 3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 compared to a 16% decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The Australian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 compared to a 11% decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations - Canadian Segment\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lodge revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,266 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mobile, open camp and product revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,519 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65,785 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales and services ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(39,835 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available lodge rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,218 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for lodges (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for lodges (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in lodges (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.028 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms include rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms exclude rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out-of-service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days. Rentable days excludes staff rooms and out-of-service rooms \nOur Canadian segment reported revenues in 2016 that were $65.8 million, or 19%, lower than 2015. The weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar by 4% in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted in a $10.6 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the weaker Canadian exchange rates, the segment experienced an 8% decline in lodge revenues, primarily due to lower room rates. This decline was partially mitigated by room needs related to the Fort McMurray fires. Finally, mobile, open camp and product revenues all declined due to overall lower activity levels.\nOur Canadian segment cost of sales and services decreased $39.8 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the decline in mobile and open camp activity, as well as a focus on cost containment and operational efficiencies. Additionally, the weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar resulted in reduced cost of sales.\nOur Canadian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 33% in 2015 to 31% in 2016, primarily due to lower contracted room rates, partially offset by room needs related to the Fort McMurray fires and lower costs due to a focus on cost containment and operational efficiencies.\nSegment Results of Operations - Australian Segment\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Village revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,149 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,149 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,897 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available village rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for villages (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(183 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for villages (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in Villages (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Australian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.008 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms include rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms exclude rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out-of-service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days.

The weakening of the average exchange rates for Australian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar by 1% in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted in a $1.2 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. Excluding the impact of the weaker Australian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 20% decline in revenues due to lower occupancy levels in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in mining activity.\nOur Australian segment cost of sales decreased $8.9 million, or 15%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by lower occupancy levels.\nOur Australian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 52% in 2016 from 55% in 2015. This was primarily driven by reduced revenues from take or pay contracts and lower occupancy compared to 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations - United States Segment\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,799 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,231 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.0 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur United States segment reported revenues in 2016 that were $25.8 million, or 68%, lower than 2015.

As further discussed below, net loss included the following items:\n \u25cf a $202.7 million pre-tax loss ($201.2 million after-tax, or $1.89 per diluted share) from goodwill impairments, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $75.6 million pre-tax loss ($50.9 million after-tax, or $0.48 per diluted share) from fixed asset impairments, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $34.9 million tax expense ($0.33 per diluted share) from the establishment of a deferred tax liability related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings which we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest and a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets related to capital losses that are not expected to be realized, included in Income tax provision below; \n \u25cf a $12.2 million pre-tax loss ($8.4 million after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share) from intangible asset impairments, included in Impairment expense below, \n \u25cf a $7.8 million pre-tax loss ($5.1 million after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from transition costs and debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off from Oil States, included Spin-Off and formation costs and Interest expense below; \n \u25cf a $4.1 million pre-tax loss ($3.1 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) from severance costs associated with the termination of an executive, included in SG&A expenses below; and \n \u25cf a $2.6 million pre-tax loss ($1.7 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) from costs associated with the proposed migration to Canada, included in SG&A expenses below. \nRevenues. Consolidated revenues decreased $424.9 million, or 45%, in 2015 compared to 2014. This decline was largely driven by decreases in Canada and Australia, due to lower occupancy, as well as weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. Please see further description in the segment discussion below.\nCost of Sales and Services. Our consolidated cost of sales decreased $217.3 million, or 40%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to decreases in occupancy in both Canada and Australia, as well as the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. Please see further description in the segment discussion below.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expense decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Increased costs associated with being a publicly traded company for a full year and costs associated with the Redomicile Transaction of $7.0 million were more than offset by lower employee costs, as well as the impact of the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars.\nSpin-Off and Formation Costs. Spin-off and formation costs of $4.3 million relate to transition costs incurred during 2014 associated with becoming a stand-alone company.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $22.0 million, or 13%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to reduced depreciation expense resulting from impairments recorded in 2014 and 2015, as well as the impact of the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. These items were partially offset by capital expenditures made during 2014 largely related to investments in our Canadian segment.\nImpairment Expense. Impairment expense of $122.9 million in 2015 included the following items:\n \u25cf Goodwill impairment losses of $43.2 million in our Canadian reporting unit; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $33.5 million related to long-lived assets in our Australian segment; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $23.0 million associated with long-lived assets in our Canadian segment, including $11.9 million related to assets that should have been impaired in the fourth quarter of 2014. We determined that the error was not material to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and therefore corrected the error in the third quarter of 2015; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $20.5 million associated with long-lived assets in our U.S. segment; and \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment loss of $2.7 million in 2015 related to a decision to sell our U.S. manufacturing facility. \nImpairment expense of $290.5 million in 2014 included the following items:\n \u25cf Goodwill impairment losses of $202.7 million, of which $16.6 million related to our U.S. segment and $186.1 million related to our Australian segment; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses associated with long-lived assets of $76.2 million, of which $59.0 million related to our U.S. segment and $17.2 million related to our Canadian segment. Of the $59.0 million impairment related to our U.S. segment, $55.8 million reduced the value of our fixed assets and $3.2 million reduced the value of our amortizable intangible assets; \n \u25cf A $9.0 million impairment of an intangible asset in Australia; and \n \u25cf An impairment totaling $2.6 million on assets that are in the custody of non-paying customers in Mexico, and for which the return or reimbursement is unlikely. \nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report for further discussion.\nOther Operating Expense (Income). Other operating expense (income) changed from an expense of $0.7 million in 2014 to income of $9.0 million in 2015. The 2015 income was primarily due to foreign currency gains on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated cash in Canadian bank accounts, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nOperating Loss. Consolidated operating loss increased $2.1 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower occupancy levels in Canada and Australia, as well as the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars, partially offset by lower impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income, net. Net interest expense, including interest expense and income to/from affiliates, increased by $1.1 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our new credit facility in 2015 and the 2015 write-off of $1.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility, partially offset by reduced interest expense in 2015 associated with the affiliate debt, which was eliminated as of the Spin-Off, as well as the 2014 write-off of $3.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the credit agreement that was terminated in conjunction with the Spin-Off. In addition, interest income decreased due to lower average cash balances in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $33.1 million, or 20.2% of pre-tax loss, compared to income tax expense of $31.4 million, or 20.1% of pre-tax loss, for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill charges, dividend income generated as part of a global restructuring, foreign tax credits, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded on a portion of our unremitted earnings of approximately $25.3 million and a valuation allowance of $11.2 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nPreviously, our effective tax rates were lower than U.S. statutory rates because of lower foreign income tax rates. However, in 2014, our income tax provision and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, a valuation allowance of approximately $51.4 million established against deferred tax assets in Australia that related to capital losses and were not expected to be realized and a deferred tax liability of $25.3 million related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings that we no longer intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest.\nOther Comprehensive Loss. Other comprehensive loss increased $29.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments due to changes in the Canadian and Australian dollar exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 16% in 2015 compared to an 8% decrease in 2014. The Australian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 11% in 2015 compared to an 8% decrease in 2014.\nSegment Results of Operations - Canadian Segment\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lodge revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>497,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(229,730 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mobile, open camp and product revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87,437 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>661,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(317,167 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales and services ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(171,469 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available lodge rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for lodges (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(953 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for lodges (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in lodges (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.123 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms includes rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms excludes rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out of service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days. Rentable days excludes staff rooms and out of service rooms. \nOur Canadian segment reported revenues in 2015 that were $317.2 million, or 48%, lower than 2014. The weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar by 14% in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted in a $51.9 million year over year reduction in revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the weaker Canadian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 38% decline in lodge revenues, primarily due to reduced occupancy and lower room rates, partially offset by the opening of the McClelland Lake Lodge, which commenced operations in the summer of 2014. Mobile, open camp and product revenue decreased due to a reduced number of large projects during 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of weaker Canadian exchange rates, product sales were essentially flat year over year.\nOur Canadian segment cost of sales and services decreased $171.5 million, or 43%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower occupancy, as well as the weakening of the average exchange rates.\nOur Canadian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 39% in 2014 to 33% in 2015, primarily due to lower contracted room rates and occupancy in Canada.\nSegment Results of Operations - Australian Segment\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Village revenue (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(77,315 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28,922 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average available village rooms (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rentable rooms for villages (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(217 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily rate for villages (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy in villages (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Australian dollar to U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.150 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms includes rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms excludes rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out of service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days.

The weakening of the average exchange rates for Australian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar by 17% in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted in a $26.5 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. Excluding the impact of the weaker Australian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 19% decline in revenues due to lower occupancy levels in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in mining activity.\nOur Australian segment cost of sales decreased $28.9 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by the weakening of the Australian dollar, as well as lower occupancy levels.\nOur Australian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 55% in 2015 from 58% in 2014. This was primarily driven by reduced take or pay revenues on expired contracts compared to 2014.\nSegment Results of Operations - U.S. Segment\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,446 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,917 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin as a % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur U.S. segment reported revenues in 2015 that were $30.4 million, or 45%, lower than 2014. The reduction was primarily due to lower U.S. drilling activity in the Bakken, Rockies and Texas markets and decreased sales in our offshore business.\nOur U.S. cost of sales decreased $16.9 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by overall lower activity levels, partially offset by a $1.1 million write-down of inventory at our U.S. manufacturing facility.\nOur U.S. segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 22% in 2014 to 4% in 2015, primarily due to the $1.1 million inventory write-down, as well as overall lower activity levels.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures, which in the past have included expanding and improving our accommodations, developing new lodges and villages, purchasing or leasing land under our land banking strategy, and for general working capital needs. In addition, capital has been used to repay debt, fund strategic business acquisitions and pay dividends. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been available cash, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from equity issuances. In addition, we may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity, fund acquisitions and refinance debt.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated liquidity position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lender commitments (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>350,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>375,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reductions in availability (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(144,803 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,690 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings against revolver capacity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,129 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,020 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outstanding letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,571 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,070 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused availability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,837 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total available liquidity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,057 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n (1) In connection with the February 2017 amendment to the Amended Credit Facility, lender commitments were reduced to $275 million. We also have a A$2.0 million bank guarantee facility. We had bank guarantees of A$0.8 million and A$1.3 million under this facility outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (2) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $144.8 million and $121.7 million, respectively, of our borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Facility could not be utilized in order to maintain compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant in our Amended Credit Facility. \nCash totaling $62.1 million was provided by operations during 2016 compared to $186.1 million provided by operations during 2015 and $291.1 million during 2014. The decreases in operating cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014, respectively, primarily were due to lower revenue resulting from reduced rates and occupancy levels in lodges and villages. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities was $13.6 million during 2016 compared to net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $67.1 million during 2015 and $5.2 million during 2014. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a greater reduction in accounts receivable balances during 2015 than during 2016. The increase in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of decreased accounts receivable balances during 2015 compared to 2014.\nCash was used in investing activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014 in the amounts of $12.7 million, $49.8 million and $239.1 million respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $19.8 million, $62.5 million and $251.2 million respectively. Capital expenditures in 2016 consisted primarily of investments in an enterprise information system and maintenance. Capital expenditures in 2015 consisted principally of costs for the construction and installation of assets for our Sitka lodge in British Columbia and our Mariana Lake lodge in Alberta. Capital expenditures in 2014 consisted principally of construction and installation of assets for our lodges and villages primarily in support of Canadian oil sands projects, including the McClelland Lake Lodge in the Athabasca oil sands region, and Australian mining production and development projects. The significant decrease in capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily a result of the construction of the McClelland Lake Lodge, which was largely completed in 2014. No comparable project was under construction in 2015.\nWe expect our capital expenditures for 2017 to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million, which excludes any expenditures for unannounced and uncommitted projects, the spending for which is contingent on obtaining customer contracts. Whether planned expenditures will actually be spent in 2017 depends on industry conditions, project approvals and schedules, customer room commitments and project and construction timing. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with available cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility. The foregoing capital expenditure forecast does not include any funds for strategic acquisitions, which we could pursue depending on the economic environment in our industry and the availability of transactions at prices deemed to be attractive to us.\nThe table below delineates historical capital expenditures split between development spending on our lodges and villages, land banking spending, mobile and open camp spending and other capital expenditures. We classify capital expenditures for rooms and central facilities at our lodges and villages as development capital expenditures. Land banking spending consists of land acquisition and initial permitting or zoning costs. Other capital expenditures in the table below relate to routine capital spending for support equipment, upgrades to infrastructure at our lodge and village properties and spending related to our manufacturing facilities, among other items. We have also classified the expenditures between expansionary and maintenance spending.\nBased on management's judgment of capital spending classifications, we believe the following table represents the components of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Expansion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaint\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Expansion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaint\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nExpansion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maint\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lodge/village\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land banking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mobile/open camp\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelopment spending in 2015 was primarily related to the construction of our Sitka lodge in British Columbia and our Mariana Lake lodge in Alberta. Development spending in 2014 was primarily related to the construction of our McClelland Lake lodge in the northern Athabasca oil sands region of Canada.\nOpen and mobile camp spending in 2014 was primarily related to additions to our Canadian mobile camp assets, as well as spending on our Antler River open camp in Melita, Manitoba.\nOther spending in 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to investments in an enterprise information system.\nNet cash of $58.3 million was used in financing activities during 2016, primarily due to repayments of term loan borrowings of $41.0 million, net repayments of revolver borrowings of $15.2 million and debt issuance costs of $2.1 million. Net cash of $349.6 million was used in financing activities during 2015, primarily due to repayments of term loan borrowings of $729.4 million, offset by borrowings of term loans of $325 million and net revolver borrowings of $59.1 million. Net cash of $16.2 million was provided by financing activities during 2014, in part due to contributions from Oil States of $28.3 million. Borrowings of $775.0 million under our new term loan facility funded a cash distribution of $750.0 million to Oil States on May 28, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in debt outstanding during 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Canada\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAustralia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings on revolving credit facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments of revolving credit facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263,329 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,609 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,800 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(325,738 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments of term loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,023 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,023 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Translation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(330 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,929 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>326,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs in the coming 12 months. If our plans or assumptions change, or are inaccurate, or if we make acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. Acquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, an element of our business strategy. The timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable and uncertain. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with debt and/or equity issuances. Our ability to obtain capital for additional projects to implement our growth strategy over the longer term will depend upon our future operating performance, financial condition and, more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing. Capital availability will be affected by prevailing conditions in our industry, the global economy, the global financial markets and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, such additional debt service requirements could be based on higher interest rates and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to shareholders. In addition, in some cases, we may incur costs to acquire land and/or construct assets without securing a customer contract or prior to finalization of an accommodations contract with a customer. If the contract is not obtained or delayed, the resulting impact could result in an impairment of the related investment.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the offering of $300 million of common shares, preferred shares, debt securities and warrants. On February 7, 2017, we closed a public offering of 23,000,000 common shares at a price to the public of $3.00 per share. We expect to use the net proceeds of $64.9 million from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nCredit Facility and Long Term Debt\nOn February 17, 2017, the third amendment to the Amended Credit Facility became effective, which:\n \u25cf Provide for the reduction by US$75 million of the aggregate revolving loan commitments under the Amended Credit Facility, to a maximum principal amount of $275 million. Accordingly, after the reduction, the revolving credit facility consists of (A) a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, as borrower, (B) a $90.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of Civeo and certain of our Canadian subsidiaries, as borrowers, (C) a $60.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of Civeo, as borrower, and (D) a $85.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of one of our Australian subsidiaries, as borrower; \n \u25cf (i) Established one additional level to the total leverage-based grid such that the interest rates for the loans range from LIBOR +2.25% to LIBOR +5.50% and (ii) increased the undrawn commitment fee from a range of 0.51% to 1.13% to a range of 0.51% to 1.24% based on total leverage; \n \u25cf Adjusted the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant, as follows; and \nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> Period Ended\n</td> <td> Maximum Leverage Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016 (no change)\n</td> <td> 5.50 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2017 (no change)\n</td> <td> 5.25 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2017 (no change)\n</td> <td> 5.25 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td> 5.85 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> 5.85 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2018\n</td> <td> 5.85 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2018\n</td> <td> 5.85 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td> 5.85 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> 5.50 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2019 & thereafter\n</td> <td> 5.25 : 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf Provided for other technical changes and amendments to the Amended Credit Facility. \nThe following table summarizes the revolving capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility as compared to the second amendment to the Credit Facility (in thousands):\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second\nAmendment to\nthe Credit\nFacility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third\nAmendment to\nthe Credit\nFacility\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capacity under revolving credit facilities:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New Canadian revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Australian revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capacity under revolving credit facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>350,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, or a base rate plus 1.25% to 4.50%, in each case based on a ratio of our total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). Canadian dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to CDOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, or a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 4.50%, in each case based on a ratio of our consolidated total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). Australian dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to BBSY plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, based on a ratio of our consolidated total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility).\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict (i) subsidiary indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes, (ii) asset sales, (iii) margin stock, (iv) specified acquisitions, (v) restrictive agreements, (vi) transactions with affiliates and (vii) investments and other restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions. Specifically, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) to consolidated interest expense, of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 5.50 to 1.0 (as of December 31, 2016). As noted above, the permitted level of the maximum leverage ratio changes over time. Each of the factors considered in the calculations of these ratios are defined in the Amended Credit Facility. EBITDA and consolidated interest, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, exclude goodwill and asset impairments, debt discount amortization and other non-cash charges. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nBorrowings under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and all the assets of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are guaranteed by our significant subsidiaries. We have 15 lenders in our Amended Credit Facility with commitments ranging from $1.1 million to $116.5 million.\nDividends\nWe do not currently pay dividends. The declaration and amount of all potential future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in our Amended Credit Facility. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends, and we may incur incremental taxes in the U.S. if we are required to repatriate foreign earnings to pay such dividends. If we elect to pay dividends in the future, the amount per share of our dividend payments may be changed, or dividends may again be suspended, without advance notice. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of market weakness. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nEffects of Inflation\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation in the past three fiscal years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years (in thousands):\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>341,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligations - expected cash payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>473,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>372,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,532 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Interest payments due under the Amended Credit Facility, which matures on May 28, 2019; based on a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% to 5.2% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016. \nOur debt obligations at December 31, 2016 are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, which is a part of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report. We have not entered into any material leases subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, thus impacting our reported results of operations and financial position. The critical accounting policies and estimates described in this section are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and the application of which requires management's most subjective judgments in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims. These liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts to cover an expected loss. Other claims or liabilities have been estimated based on their fair value or our experience in these matters and, when appropriate, the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts. Upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability. Examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities include litigation, taxes, interest, insurance claims, contract claims and obligations and asset retirement obligations.\nImpairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets, including Goodwill\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid for acquired businesses over the allocated fair value of the related net assets after impairments, if applicable. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, and we reduced the value of our goodwill to zero. Please see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report for further discussion of goodwill impairments recorded in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe do not amortize goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (the component\u201d level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at the component level. Each segment of our business represents a separate reporting unit, and all three of our reporting units previously had goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the reporting unit's implied fair value (IFV) of goodwill. We conduct our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.\nOur assessment consisted of a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compared each reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the IFV of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered impaired, and a second step was performed to determine the amount of impairment. Future impairment tests will be impacted by new accounting guidance which eliminates the second step of the goodwill impairment test.\nWe are given the option to test for impairment of our goodwill by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the currently prescribed two-step impairment test is unnecessary. In developing a qualitative assessment to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold, each reporting unit with goodwill is assessed separately and different relevant events and circumstances are evaluated for each unit. We have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2014, we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the first step of the impairment test. In performing the two-step impairment test, we compare each reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the IFV of the reporting unit. Because none of our reporting units has a publically quoted market price, we must determine the value that willing buyers and sellers would place on the reporting unit through a routine sale process (a Level 3 fair value measurement). In our analysis, we target an IFV that represents the value that would be placed on the reporting unit by market participants, and value the reporting unit based on historical and projected results throughout a cycle, not the value of the reporting unit based on trough or peak earnings. The IFV of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of (i) an analysis of trading multiples of comparable companies (Market Approach) and (ii) discounted projected cash flows (Income Approach). We also use acquisition multiples analyses in certain circumstances. The relative weighting of each approach varies by reporting unit, based on management's judgment.\nMarket Approach - This valuation approach utilizes publicly traded comparable companies' enterprise values, as compared to their recent and forecasted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) information. We have historically used an average EBITDA multiple ranging from approximately 6.5x to approximately 9.5x depending on the reporting unit. We use EBITDA because it is a widely used key indicator of the cash generating capacity of companies in our industry.\nIncome Approach - This valuation approach derives a present value of the reporting unit's projected future annual cash flows over the next five years. We use a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows, including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions, rates, occupancy levels, costs and expenses and capital expenditures. These assumptions vary by each reporting unit depending on market conditions. In addition, a terminal value is estimated, using a Gordon Growth methodology with a long-term growth rate of 3%. We discount our projected cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns that would be required by a market participant.\nThe IFV of our reporting units is affected by future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated spending by our customers and the cost of capital. Our estimate of IFV requires us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances, such as industry and/or local market conditions that might directly impact each reporting unit's operations in the future, and are therefore uncertain. We selected these valuation approaches because we believe the combination of these approaches and our best judgment regarding underlying assumptions and estimates provides us with the best estimate of fair value for each of our reporting units. We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and widely accepted by investors. The IFV of each reporting unit would change if our assumptions under these valuation approaches, or relative weighting of the valuation approaches, were materially modified.\nDefinite-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets. The recoverability of the carrying values of tangible and intangible assets is assessed at an asset group level which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Whenever, in management's judgment, events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset groups may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows, an asset impairment evaluation is performed. Indicators of impairment might include persistent negative economic trends affecting the markets we serve, recurring losses or lowered expectations of future cash flows expected to be generated by our assets.\nIn performing this analysis, the first step is to compare each asset group's carrying value to estimates of undiscounted future cash flows. We use a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows, including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions, rates, occupancy levels, costs and expenses and capital expenditures. The estimates are consistent with those used for purposes of our goodwill impairment test, as further discussed in Goodwill, above.\nIf, based on the assessment, the carrying values of any of our asset groups are determined to not be recoverable, we proceed to the second step. In this step, we compare the fair value of the respective asset group to its carrying value. Our estimate of the fair value requires us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances, such as industry and/or local market conditions that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future, and are therefore uncertain.\nOur industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated, as well as the predictability of these cash flows and our determination of whether a decline in value of our investment has occurred, can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and, in periods of prolonged down cycles, may result in impairment losses. If this assessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset group. The fair value of the asset group is based on prices of similar assets, if available, or discounted cash flows.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator that certain asset groups used, or expected to be used, in conjunction with potential LNG projects in British Columbia may be impaired as a result of recent market developments, including the delay in FID discussed above. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of each of the asset groups to determine if they continued to be recoverable based on their estimated future cash flows. Based on the assessment, the carrying values of our mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in British Columbia were determined to not be recoverable, and an impairment charge totaling $37.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn estimating future cash flows, we made numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future and are therefore uncertain. These assumptions with respect to future circumstances included future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated customer spending, and industry and/or local market conditions. These assumptions represented our best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances. However, different assumptions could result in a determination that the carrying values of additional asset groups are no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows for certain of our assets included in this assessment that were not impaired were reduced by 10%, an additional impairment of between $25 million and $35 million could be indicated. Our estimate of fair value was primarily calculated using the Income Approach, which derives a present value of the asset group based on the asset groups' estimated future cash flows. We discounted our estimated future cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns required by a market participant.\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impairments of definite-lived tangible and intangible assets recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. We are required to evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In performing the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. The measurement of the impairment is calculated based on the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues are recognized based on a periodic (usually daily) room rate or when the services are rendered. Revenues are recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of our contractual relationships with our customers. In some contracts, the rate or committed room numbers may vary over the contract term. In these cases, revenue may be deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Revenue from the sale of products, not accounted for utilizing the percentage-of-completion method, is recognized when delivery to and acceptance by the customer has occurred, when title and all significant risks of ownership have passed to the customer, collectability is probable and pricing is fixed and determinable. Our product sales terms do not include significant post-delivery obligations.\nFor significant projects, revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Billings on such contracts in excess of costs incurred and estimated profits are classified as deferred revenue. Costs incurred and estimated profits in excess of billings on percentage-of-completion contracts are recognized as unbilled receivables. Our management believes this method is the most appropriate measure of progress on large contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to projected costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of our estimates and materially impact our future reported earnings.\nRevenues exclude taxes assessed based on revenues such as sales or value added taxes.\nCost of services includes labor, food, utilities, cleaning supplies and other costs associated with operating the accommodations facilities. Cost of goods sold includes all direct material and labor costs and those costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nEstimation of Useful Lives\nThe selection of the useful lives of many of our assets requires the judgments of our operating personnel as to the length of these useful lives. Our judgment in this area is influenced by our historical experience in operating our assets, technological developments and expectations of future demand for the assets. Should our estimates be too long or short, we might eventually report a disproportionate number of losses or gains upon disposition or retirement of our long-lived assets. We reevaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our assets when certain events occur that directly impact the useful lives and salvage values, including changes in operating condition, functional capability and market and economic factors. We believe our estimates of useful lives are appropriate.\nShare-Based Compensation\nOur historic share-based compensation is based on participating in Civeo's 2014 Equity Participation Plan and, prior to the Spin-Off, the Oil States 2001 Equity Participation Plan (collectively, the Plans). Our disclosures reflect only our employees' participation in the Plans. We are required to estimate the fair value of share compensation made pursuant to awards under the Plans. An initial estimate of the fair value of each option award or restricted share award determines the amount of share compensation expense we will recognize in the future. For stock option awards prior to the Spin-Off, to estimate the value of the awards under the Plan, Oil States selected a fair value calculation model. Oil States chose the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options awarded under the Plan. Oil States chose this model because option awards were made under straightforward vesting terms, option prices and option lives. Utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model required Oil States to estimate the length of time options will remain outstanding, a risk free interest rate for the estimated period options are assumed to be outstanding, forfeiture rates, future dividends and the volatility of our common stock. All of these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future share-based compensation expense recognition. We have not made any option awards subsequent to the Spin-Off, but, in the event that we make future awards, we expect to utilize a similar valuation methodology. We will continually monitor our actual experience and change assumptions for future awards as we consider appropriate.\nWe also grant performance awards under the Civeo Plan. Awards granted in 2016 will be earned in amounts between 0% and 200% of the participant's target performance share award, based on the payout percentage associated with Civeo's relative total shareholder return rank among a peer group of 12 other companies. The fair value of the 2016 awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. We chose this model because the performance awards contain complex vesting terms. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model required us to estimate the risk-free interest rate and the expected market price volatility of our common shares as well as a peer group of companies over a time period equal to the expected term of the award, The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period. For additional details, see Note 15 - Share Based Compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with current accounting standards regarding the accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect at the time the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.\nWhen our earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for Canadian income taxes is made for these earnings. If any of the subsidiaries have a distribution of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both Canadian income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our U.S. foreign subsidiary companies, and recognized a deferred tax liability of $25.3 million as of December 31, 2014 related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings. During the third quarter of 2015, following our redomiciliation to Canada, we determined that the existing deferred tax liability recorded was no longer required. We reversed the deferred tax liability and recorded a tax benefit of approximately $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We do not expect to provide Canadian income taxes on future foreign earnings.\nWe record a valuation allowance in each reporting period when our management believes that it is more likely than not that any recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our management will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation allowance in the future, based upon our operating results. Please see Note 12 - Income Taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we are required to estimate a liability for future income taxes for any uncertainty for potential income tax exposures. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.\nFor periods prior to the Spin-Off, our results were included in the consolidated tax return of Oil States. We have determined our U.S. income taxes in the combined financial statements by assuming our results are excluded from the consolidated return and then comparing consolidated taxable income and taxes due with and then without our results. Canadian and Australian taxes are based on actual tax returns filed by our foreign subsidiaries.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Please see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business operations. Please read Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including the known material factors set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nSpin-Off\nOn May 30, 2014, Oil States International, Inc. (Oil States) spun-off its Accommodations Segment (Accommodations) into a standalone, publicly traded Delaware corporation (Civeo US). In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by Oil States distributing to its stockholders all 106,538,044 shares of common stock of Civeo US it held after the market closed on May 30, 2014 (the Spin-Off). In connection with the Spin-off, on May 28, 2014, we made a special cash distribution to Oil States of $750 million. Following the Spin-Off, Oil States retained no ownership interest in Civeo US, and each company now has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management.\nRedomiciling to Canada\nOn July 17, 2015, we completed our change in place of incorporation from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada (the Redomicile Transaction). In the Redomicile Transaction, Civeo Corporation, a British Columbia, Canada limited company formerly named Civeo Canadian Holdings ULC (Civeo Canada), became the publicly traded parent company of the Civeo group of companies, and our former publicly traded Delaware parent, Civeo US, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Civeo Canada. Each issued share of Civeo US common stock, other than those shares of Civeo US common stock held by Civeo US in treasury, was effectively transferred to Civeo Canada and converted into one common share, no par value, of Civeo Canada. An aggregate of approximately 107.5 million Civeo Canada common shares were issued in the Redomicile Transaction. The Civeo Canada common shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol CVEO,\u201d the same symbol under which the Civeo US common stock traded prior to the effective time.\nThe Redomicile Transaction qualified as a self-directed redomiciling\u201d of the Company as permitted under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. U.S. federal income tax laws permit a company to change its domicile to a foreign jurisdiction without corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes provided that such company has substantial business activity\u201d in the relevant jurisdiction. Substantial business activity\u201d is defined as foreign operations consisting of over 25% of the company's total (i) revenues, (ii) assets, (iii) employees and (iv) employee compensation. With approximately 50% or more of our operations in Canada based on these metrics, we qualified for a self-directed redomiciling.\nWe incurred costs related to the Redomicile Transaction totaling $1.3 million, $7.0 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDescription of the Business\nWe are one of the largest integrated providers of workforce accommodations, logistics and facility management services to the natural resource industry. Our scalable modular facilities provide long-term and temporary accommodations where traditional accommodations and related infrastructure is insufficient, inaccessible or not cost effective. Once facilities are deployed in the field, we also provide catering and food services, housekeeping, laundry, facility management, water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and redeployment logistics. Our accommodations support our customers' employees and contractors in the Canadian oil sands and in a variety of oil and natural gas drilling, mining and related natural resource applications as well as disaster relief efforts, primarily in Canada, Australia and the United States. We operate in three principal reportable business segments - Canada, Australia and U.S.\nBasis of Presentation\nUnless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in these consolidated financial statements to Civeo,\u201d the Company,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or we\u201d for the time period prior to the Spin-Off mean the Accommodations business of Oil States. For time periods after the Spin-Off, but prior to July 17, 2015, these terms refer to Civeo US and its consolidated subsidiaries. For time periods after July 17, 2015, these terms refer to Civeo Canada and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows consisted of the Oil States' Accommodations business and an allocable portion of its corporate costs, which represented a combined reporting entity. The combined financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-Off have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Oil States. The combined financial statements reflect our historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). The combined financial statements include certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Oil States corporate level, but are specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us.\nAll financial information presented after the Spin-Off represents the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Civeo. Accordingly:\n \u25cf Our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity / net investment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist entirely of the consolidated results of Civeo. \n \u25cf Our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity / net investment for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist of (i) the combined results of the Oil States' Accommodations business for the five months ended May 30, 2014 and (ii) the consolidated results of Civeo for the seven months ended December 31, 2014. \n \u25cf Our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist entirely of the consolidated balances of Civeo. \nThe assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements have been reflected on a historical basis, as immediately prior to the Spin-Off all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Oil States and were transferred within the Oil States consolidated group. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. All affiliate transactions between Civeo and Oil States have been included in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-Off included expense allocations for: (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Oil States, including, but not limited to finance, legal, risk management, tax, treasury, information technology, human resources, and certain other shared services, (2) certain employee benefits and incentives and (3) equity-based compensation. These expenses were allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on estimated time spent by Oil States personnel, a pro-rata basis of headcount or other relevant measures of Oil States and its subsidiaries. We consider the basis on which the expenses were allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense we would have incurred as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, which functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Following the Spin-Off, we perform these functions using our own resources or purchase external services. Until February 28, 2015, however, some of these functions were provided by Oil States under a transition services agreement. Please see Note 17 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nWe provide workforce accommodations to the natural resource industry in Canada, Australia and the U.S. Demand for our services can be attributed to two phases of our customers' projects: (1) the development or construction phase and (2) the operations or production phase. Initial demand for our services is driven by our customers' capital spending programs related to the construction and development of oil sands and coal mines and associated infrastructure as well as the exploration for oil and natural gas. Long-term demand for our services is driven by continued development and expansion of natural resource production and operation of oil sands and mining facilities. Industry capital spending programs are generally based on the outlook for commodity prices, economic growth and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expected commodity prices, principally related to crude oil, metallurgical (met) coal and natural gas.\nIn Canada, Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude is the benchmark price for our oil sands accommodations customers. Pricing for WCS is driven by several factors, including the underlying price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude and the availability of transportation infrastructure. Historically, WCS has traded at a discount to WTI, creating a WCS Differential,\u201d due to transportation costs and limited capacity to move Canadian heavy oil production to refineries, primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The WCS Differential has varied depending on the extent of transportation capacity availability.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, global oil prices dropped to their lowest level in over ten years due to concerns over global oil demand, global crude inventory levels, worldwide economic growth and price cutting by major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia. Increasing global supply, including increased U.S. shale oil production, also negatively impacted pricing. With falling Brent Crude and WTI oil prices, WCS also fell. Prices began to increase in March 2016, and have continued to increase in the first quarter of 2017. WCS prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 averaged $34.34 per barrel compared to a low of $20.26 in the first quarter of 2016 and a high of $83.78 in the second quarter of 2014. The WCS Differential increased from $13.25 per barrel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 to $16.10 per barrel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. As of February 20, 2017, the WTI price was $53.40 and the WCS price was $39.78, resulting in a WCS Differential of $13.62.\nThere remains a risk that prices for Canadian oil sands crude oil related products could deteriorate or remain at current depressed levels for an extended period of time, and the discount between WCS crude prices and WTI crude prices could widen. The depressed price levels through the first quarter of 2016 negatively impacted exploration, development, maintenance and production spending and activity by Canadian operators and, therefore, demand for our services in late 2014, 2015 and 2016. Our Canadian oil sands customers could continue to delay maintenance spending and additional investments in their oil sands assets as well.\nIn Australia, approximately 80% of our rooms are located in the Bowen Basin and primarily serve met coal mines in that region. Met coal pricing and growth in production in the Bowen Basin region is predominantly influenced by the levels of global steel production, which increased by 0.7% during 2016 compared to 2015. As of February 20, 2017, contract met coal prices were approximately $285 per metric tonne, significantly higher than the September 2016 contract price of $92.50 per metric tonne, due to supply side factors that have restricted met coal volumes. Despite the increase, we have not yet seen a significant impact on customers' willingness to increase activity. We expect that spot prices for met coal will need to be sustained at levels above $150 per metric tonne for at least nine to twelve months before we see an impact on customer activity levels, and therefore, the demand for accommodations. Long-term demand for steel will be driven by increased steel consumption per capita in developing economies, such as China and India, whose current consumption per capita is a fraction of developed countries. Our customers continue to actively implement cost, productivity and efficiency measures to drive down their cost base.\nNatural gas and WTI crude oil prices, discussed above, have an impact on the demand for our U.S. accommodations business. With limited export capabilities, U.S. natural gas prices are primarily influenced by domestic supply/demand dynamics and resultant inventory levels. U.S. natural gas production has continued to outpace demand, which has caused prices to continue to be weak relative to historical prices over the past decade. U.S. natural gas inventory levels at December 31, 2016 were 3.31 Tcf, 12% lower than inventory levels from December 31, 2015 and 1% under seasonally comparable average inventory levels over the past five years. Prices for natural gas in the U.S. averaged $2.55 per mcf in 2016, a 3% decrease from the average price in 2015. Although the prices have increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017, at these levels, it is uneconomic to increase development in several domestic, gas-focused basins. If natural gas production growth continues to surpass demand in the U.S. and/or the supply of natural gas were to increase, whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional production or associated natural gas production from oil wells, prices for natural gas could be constrained for an extended period and result in fewer rigs drilling for natural gas in the near-term.\nRecent WTI crude, WCS crude, met coal and natural gas pricing trends are as follows:\n\n__________\n (1) Source: WTI crude and natural gas prices are from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and WCS crude prices and Seaborne hard coking coal contract prices are from Bloomberg. \nOverview\nAs noted above, demand for our services is primarily tied to the outlook for crude oil and met coal prices. Other factors that can affect our business and financial results include the general global economic environment and regulatory changes in Canada, Australia, the U.S. and other markets.\nOur business is predominantly located in northern Alberta, Canada and Queensland, Australia, and we derive most of our business from resource companies who are developing and producing oil sands and met coal resources and, to a lesser extent, other hydrocarbon and mineral resources. More than three-fourths of our revenue is generated by our large-scale lodge and village facilities. Where traditional accommodations and infrastructure are insufficient, inaccessible or cost ineffective, our lodge and village facilities provide comprehensive accommodations services similar to those found in an urban hotel. We typically contract our facilities to our customers on a fee per day basis that covers lodging and meals and that is based on the duration of their needs which can range from several weeks to several years.\nGenerally, our customers are making multi-billion dollar investments to develop their prospects, which have estimated reserve lives ranging from ten years to in excess of thirty years. Consequently, these investments are dependent on those customers' longer-term view of commodity demand and prices.\nIn response to decreases in crude oil prices beginning in late 2014, many of our customers in Canada curtailed their operations and spending, and most major oil sands mining operators are continuing to seek to reduce their costs and limit capital spending, accordingly limiting the demand for accommodations like we provide. In Australia, approximately 80% of our rooms are located in the Bowen Basin and primarily serve met coal mines in that region where our customers continue to actively implement cost productivity and efficiency measures to drive down their cost base.\nIn recent months, however, several catalysts have emerged that we believe could have favorable intermediate to long-term implications for our core end markets. Since the announcement by OPEC in late November 2016 to cut production quotas and the subsequent rise in oil prices and oil price expectations, certain operators with steam-assisted gravity drainage operations in the Canadian oil sands have announced increased capital budgets for 2017. In addition, the recent regulatory approval of major pipeline projects has the potential to both drive incremental demand for mobile accommodations assets and to improve take-away capacity for Canadian oil sands producers over the longer term. Additionally, we believe that the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S., if constructed, would be a positive catalyst for Canadian oil sands producers, as it would bolster confidence in future take-away capacity from the region to Gulf Coast refiners. In Australia, we believe prices are currently at a level that may contribute to increased activity over the longer term.\nWhile we believe that these macroeconomic developments are positive for our customers and for the underlying demand for the accommodations services we provide, we do not expect an immediate improvement in our business and are expecting our full year 2017 revenues and EBITDA to be materially lower compared to 2016. Accordingly, we plan to focus on enhancing the quality of our operations and maintaining financial discipline and to proactively manage our business as market conditions continue to evolve.\nWe began expansion of our room count in Kitimat, British Columbia during the second half of 2015 to support potential liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on the west coast of British Columbia. We were awarded a contract with LNG Canada (LNGC) for the provision of open lodge rooms and associated services that runs through September 2017. To support this contract, we have developed a new accommodations facility, named Sitka Lodge, which includes private washrooms, recreational facilities and other amenities. This lodge currently has 436 rooms, with the potential to expand to serve future accommodations demand in the region.\nIn addition, we were awarded a contract with LNGC to construct a 4,500 person workforce accommodation center (Cedar Valley Lodge) for a proposed liquefaction and export facility in Kitimat, British Columbia. Construction of Cedar Valley Lodge will not commence until LNGC's joint venture participants have made a positive final investment decision (FID). The FID was originally planned for the end of 2016; however, this decision has been delayed until a future time that has not yet been determined. We are currently in discussions with LNGC to extend this contract until a positive FID is made. Should the project ultimately move forward, British Columbia LNG activity could become a material driver of future activity for our Sitka Lodge, as well as for our mobile fleet assets which are well suited for the related pipeline construction activity. However, should the project, and other potential projects in the area, not move forward, the resulting impact may negatively affect our future results of operations and our existing long-lived assets in Canada, including our Sitka Lodge, and may require us to record further material impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of these assets over fair value. With the delay in the FID, we currently expect that LNGC will continue to utilize rooms at our Sitka Lodge through September 2017 in accordance with the terms of our contract. However, this contract may be extended to a new FID date based upon our current discussions with LNGC. There can be no assurance that LNGC's joint venture participants will reach a positive FID or that our contracts with LNGC will be extended.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator that certain asset groups used, or expected to be used, in conjunction with potential LNG projects in British Columbia may be impaired as a result of recent market developments, including the delay in FID discussed above. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of each of the asset groups to determine if they continued to be recoverable based on their estimated future cash flows. Based on the assessment, the carrying values of our mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in British Columbia were determined to not be recoverable, and an impairment charge totaling $37.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn estimating future cash flows, we made numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future and are therefore uncertain. These assumptions with respect to future circumstances included future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated customer spending, and industry and/or local market conditions. These assumptions represented our best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances. However, different assumptions could result in a determination that the carrying values of additional asset groups are no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows for certain of our assets included in this assessment that were not impaired were reduced by 10%, an additional impairment of between $25 million and $35 million could be indicated. Our estimate of fair value was primarily calculated using the Income Approach, which derives a present value of the asset group based on the asset groups estimated future cash flows. We discounted our estimated future cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns required by a market participant.\nWe expanded our Australian room capacity in 2012 and 2013 to meet increasing demand, notably in the Bowen Basin in Queensland and in the Gunnedah Basin in New South Wales to support coal production, and in Western Australia to support LNG and other energy-related projects. In early 2013, a confluence of falling met coal prices, additional carbon and mining taxes on our Australian customers and several years of cost inflation caused several of our customers to curtail or cease production from higher cost mines and delay or materially reduce their growth plans. This has negatively affected our ability to expand our room count and has led to a decrease in occupancy levels. With supply disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to Chinese production policy and Australian weather, the supply / demand balance in global met coal has improved. As a result, met coal prices have increased materially. We expect our Australian customers will wait for a stabilization in prices above $150/tonne before significantly increasing their spending, which may take nine months or longer.\nIf oil and coal prices decline from current levels, the resulting impact may negatively affect the value of our long-lived assets. Impairment expense of $46.1 million associated with long-lived assets was recorded in 2016. Impairment expense of $122.9 million was recorded in 2015, of which $79.7 million was associated with long-lived assets and the remaining $43.2 million was associated with goodwill. Impairment expense of $290.5 million was recorded in 2014, of which $87.8 million was associated with long-lived assets and the remaining $202.7 million was associated with goodwill.\nExchange rates between the U.S. dollar and each of the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar influence our U.S. dollar reported financial results. Our business has historically derived the vast majority of its revenues and operating income in Canada and Australia. These revenues and profits are translated into U.S. dollars for U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) financial reporting purposes. The Canadian dollar was valued at an average exchange rate of U.S. $0.76 for 2016 compared to U.S. $0.78 for 2015, a decrease of approximately 4%. The Canadian dollar was valued at an exchange rate of $0.74 on December 31, 2016 and $0.72 on December 31, 2015. The Australian dollar was valued at an average exchange rate of U.S. $0.74 for 2016 compared to U.S. $0.75 for 2015, a decrease of approximately 1%. The Australian dollar was valued at an exchange rate of $0.72 on December 31, 2016 and $0.73 on December 31, 2015. These fluctuations of the Canadian and Australian dollars have had and will continue to have an impact on the translation of earnings generated from our Canadian and Australian subsidiaries and, therefore, our financial results.\nWe continue to monitor the global economy, the demand for crude oil, met coal and natural gas and the resultant impact on the capital spending plans of our customers in order to plan our business. We currently expect that our 2017 capital expenditures, exclusive of any business acquisitions, will total approximately $15 million to $18 million, compared to 2016 capital expenditures of $19.8 million. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures.\nDuring January 2017, we closed a public offering of 23 million common shares. We expect to use the net proceeds of $64.9 million from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nResults of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated, discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is based on a comparison with the corresponding period of 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\nWe reported net loss attributable to Civeo for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $96.4 million, or $0.90 per diluted share. As further discussed below, net loss included (i) a $46.1 million pre-tax loss ($35.9 million after-tax, or $0.34 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of fixed assets, included in Impairment expense, and (ii) a $1.3 million pre-tax loss ($1.2 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) from costs incurred in connection with the Redomicile Transaction, included in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense below.\nWe reported net loss attributable to Civeo for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $131.8 million, or $1.24 per diluted share. As further discussed below, net loss included the following items:\n \u25cf an $80.7 million pre-tax loss ($56.0 million after-tax, or $0.52 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $43.2 million pre-tax loss ($43.2 million after-tax, or $0.40 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of goodwill in our Canadian reporting unit, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $7.0 million pre-tax loss ($4.6 million after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from costs incurred in connection with the Redomicile Transaction, included in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense below; and \n \u25cf a $1.5 million pre-tax loss ($1.5 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) from the write off of debt issuance costs, included in Interest expense and income, net below. \nRevenues. Consolidated revenues decreased $120.7 million, or 23%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decline was largely driven by decreases in Canada due to lower room rates, Australia and the U.S. due to lower occupancy, as well as weaker Canadian dollars in 2016 compared to 2015. Please see the discussion of segment results of operations below for further information.\nCost of Sales and Services. Our consolidated cost of sales decreased $68.0 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in occupancy in both Canada and Australia, as well as the weaker Canadian dollars in 2016 compared to 2015. Please see the discussion of segment results of operations below for further information.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expense decreased $13.1 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reduced compensation as a result of workforce reductions in 2016 and 2015, lower professional fees due to lower costs associated with the Redomicile Transaction, lower bad debt expense when compared to 2015, lower incentive compensation costs and the impact of the weaker Canadian dollars. These items were partially offset by higher share based compensation expense associated with phantom share awards. The increase in share based compensation was largely due to an increase in our share price during 2016. We use current market prices to remeasure these awards at each reporting date.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $21.7 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced depreciation expense resulting from impairments recorded in 2015, as well as the impact of the weaker Canadian dollars.\nImpairment Expense. Impairment expense of $46.1 million in 2016 consisted of:\n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $37.7 million related to mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in the British Columbia LNG market in our Canadian segment; and \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $8.4 million related to the impairment of fixed assets in our U.S. segment. \nImpairment expense of $122.9 million in 2015 consisted of:\n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $33.5 million related to fixed assets in our Australian segment; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment totaling $2.7 million in 2015 related to a decision to sell our U.S. manufacturing facility; \n \u25cf Goodwill impairment losses of $43.2 million in our Canadian reporting unit; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses totaling $20.5 million associated with long-lived assets in our U.S. segment; and \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses totaling $23.0 million associated with long-lived assets in our Canadian segment. \nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for further discussion.\nOther Operating Expense (Income). Other operating expense (income) decreased from income of $9.0 million in 2015 to an expense of $0.6 million in 2016. The 2015 income was primarily due to foreign currency gains on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated cash in Canadian bank accounts, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nOperating Loss. Consolidated operating loss decreased $49.2 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower impairment expense in the 2016 period, partially offset by lower occupancy levels in Canada and Australia and the weaker Canadian dollars.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income, net. Net interest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from decreased interest income due to lower average cash balances in 2016 as compared to 2015 and lower capitalized interest in 2016. This was partially offset by decreased interest expense associated with lower amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility and the 2015 write-off of $1.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $20.1 million, or 17.3% of pre-tax income, compared to a benefit of $33.1 million, or 20.2% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was lower than the Canadian statutory rate of 27%, primarily due to losses in Australia and U.S. for which no tax benefit was recorded. As a result, a valuation allowance of $15.1 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nIn 2015, our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill charges, dividend income generated as part of a global restructuring, foreign tax credits, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded on a portion of our unremitted earnings of approximately $25.3 million and a valuation allowance of $11.2 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other comprehensive income increased $171.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments, due to changes in the Canadian and Australian dollar exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar increased 3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 compared to a 16% decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The Australian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 compared to a 11% decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations - Canadian Segment\n\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms include rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms exclude rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out-of-service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days. Rentable days excludes staff rooms and out-of-service rooms \nOur Canadian segment reported revenues in 2016 that were $65.8 million, or 19%, lower than 2015. The weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar by 4% in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted in a $10.6 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the weaker Canadian exchange rates, the segment experienced an 8% decline in lodge revenues, primarily due to lower room rates. This decline was partially mitigated by room needs related to the Fort McMurray fires. Finally, mobile, open camp and product revenues all declined due to overall lower activity levels.\nOur Canadian segment cost of sales and services decreased $39.8 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the decline in mobile and open camp activity, as well as a focus on cost containment and operational efficiencies. Additionally, the weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar resulted in reduced cost of sales.\nOur Canadian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 33% in 2015 to 31% in 2016, primarily due to lower contracted room rates, partially offset by room needs related to the Fort McMurray fires and lower costs due to a focus on cost containment and operational efficiencies.\nSegment Results of Operations - Australian Segment\n\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms include rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms exclude rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out-of-service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days. Rentable days excludes staff rooms and out-of-service rooms. \nOur Australian segment reported revenues in 2016 that were $29.1 million, or 21%, lower than 2015. The weakening of the average exchange rates for Australian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar by 1% in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted in a $1.2 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. Excluding the impact of the weaker Australian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 20% decline in revenues due to lower occupancy levels in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in mining activity.\nOur Australian segment cost of sales decreased $8.9 million, or 15%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by lower occupancy levels.\nOur Australian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 52% in 2016 from 55% in 2015. This was primarily driven by reduced revenues from take or pay contracts and lower occupancy compared to 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations - United States Segment\n\nOur United States segment reported revenues in 2016 that were $25.8 million, or 68%, lower than 2015. The reduction was primarily due to continued lower U.S. drilling activity in the Bakken, Rockies and Texas markets and decreased sales in our offshore business.\nOur United States cost of sales decreased $19.2 million, or 53%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by overall lower activity levels.\nOur United States segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 4% in 2015 to (43%) in 2016, primarily due to overall lower activity levels, which were insufficient to cover the fixed cost structure of our United States segment.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nWe reported net loss attributable to Civeo for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $131.8 million, or $1.24 per diluted share. As further discussed below, net loss included the following items:\n \u25cf an $80.7 million pre-tax loss ($56.0 million after-tax, or $0.52 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $43.2 million pre-tax loss ($43.2 million after-tax, or $0.40 per diluted share) resulting from the impairment of goodwill in our Canadian reporting unit, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $7.0 million pre-tax loss ($4.6 million after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from costs incurred in connection with the Redomicile Transaction, included in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense below; and \n \u25cf a $1.5 million pre-tax loss ($1.5 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) from the write off of debt issuance costs, included in Interest expense and income, net below. \nWe reported net loss attributable to Civeo for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $189.0 million, or $1.77 per diluted share. As further discussed below, net loss included the following items:\n \u25cf a $202.7 million pre-tax loss ($201.2 million after-tax, or $1.89 per diluted share) from goodwill impairments, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $75.6 million pre-tax loss ($50.9 million after-tax, or $0.48 per diluted share) from fixed asset impairments, included in Impairment expense below; \n \u25cf a $34.9 million tax expense ($0.33 per diluted share) from the establishment of a deferred tax liability related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings which we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest and a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets related to capital losses that are not expected to be realized, included in Income tax provision below; \n \u25cf a $12.2 million pre-tax loss ($8.4 million after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share) from intangible asset impairments, included in Impairment expense below, \n \u25cf a $7.8 million pre-tax loss ($5.1 million after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from transition costs and debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off from Oil States, included Spin-Off and formation costs and Interest expense below; \n \u25cf a $4.1 million pre-tax loss ($3.1 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) from severance costs associated with the termination of an executive, included in SG&A expenses below; and \n \u25cf a $2.6 million pre-tax loss ($1.7 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) from costs associated with the proposed migration to Canada, included in SG&A expenses below. \nRevenues. Consolidated revenues decreased $424.9 million, or 45%, in 2015 compared to 2014. This decline was largely driven by decreases in Canada and Australia, due to lower occupancy, as well as weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. Please see further description in the segment discussion below.\nCost of Sales and Services. Our consolidated cost of sales decreased $217.3 million, or 40%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to decreases in occupancy in both Canada and Australia, as well as the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. Please see further description in the segment discussion below.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expense decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Increased costs associated with being a publicly traded company for a full year and costs associated with the Redomicile Transaction of $7.0 million were more than offset by lower employee costs, as well as the impact of the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars.\nSpin-Off and Formation Costs. Spin-off and formation costs of $4.3 million relate to transition costs incurred during 2014 associated with becoming a stand-alone company.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $22.0 million, or 13%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to reduced depreciation expense resulting from impairments recorded in 2014 and 2015, as well as the impact of the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars. These items were partially offset by capital expenditures made during 2014 largely related to investments in our Canadian segment.\nImpairment Expense. Impairment expense of $122.9 million in 2015 included the following items:\n \u25cf Goodwill impairment losses of $43.2 million in our Canadian reporting unit; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $33.5 million related to long-lived assets in our Australian segment; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $23.0 million associated with long-lived assets in our Canadian segment, including $11.9 million related to assets that should have been impaired in the fourth quarter of 2014. We determined that the error was not material to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and therefore corrected the error in the third quarter of 2015; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses of $20.5 million associated with long-lived assets in our U.S. segment; and \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment loss of $2.7 million in 2015 related to a decision to sell our U.S. manufacturing facility. \nImpairment expense of $290.5 million in 2014 included the following items:\n \u25cf Goodwill impairment losses of $202.7 million, of which $16.6 million related to our U.S. segment and $186.1 million related to our Australian segment; \n \u25cf Pre-tax impairment losses associated with long-lived assets of $76.2 million, of which $59.0 million related to our U.S. segment and $17.2 million related to our Canadian segment. Of the $59.0 million impairment related to our U.S. segment, $55.8 million reduced the value of our fixed assets and $3.2 million reduced the value of our amortizable intangible assets; \n \u25cf A $9.0 million impairment of an intangible asset in Australia; and \n \u25cf An impairment totaling $2.6 million on assets that are in the custody of non-paying customers in Mexico, and for which the return or reimbursement is unlikely. \nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report for further discussion.\nOther Operating Expense (Income). Other operating expense (income) changed from an expense of $0.7 million in 2014 to income of $9.0 million in 2015. The 2015 income was primarily due to foreign currency gains on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated cash in Canadian bank accounts, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nOperating Loss. Consolidated operating loss increased $2.1 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower occupancy levels in Canada and Australia, as well as the weakening Canadian and Australian dollars, partially offset by lower impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income, net. Net interest expense, including interest expense and income to/from affiliates, increased by $1.1 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our new credit facility in 2015 and the 2015 write-off of $1.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility, partially offset by reduced interest expense in 2015 associated with the affiliate debt, which was eliminated as of the Spin-Off, as well as the 2014 write-off of $3.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the credit agreement that was terminated in conjunction with the Spin-Off. In addition, interest income decreased due to lower average cash balances in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $33.1 million, or 20.2% of pre-tax loss, compared to income tax expense of $31.4 million, or 20.1% of pre-tax loss, for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill charges, dividend income generated as part of a global restructuring, foreign tax credits, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded on a portion of our unremitted earnings of approximately $25.3 million and a valuation allowance of $11.2 million established against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Australia.\nPreviously, our effective tax rates were lower than U.S. statutory rates because of lower foreign income tax rates. However, in 2014, our income tax provision and effective tax rate were impacted by the effect of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, a valuation allowance of approximately $51.4 million established against deferred tax assets in Australia that related to capital losses and were not expected to be realized and a deferred tax liability of $25.3 million related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings that we no longer intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest.\nOther Comprehensive Loss. Other comprehensive loss increased $29.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments due to changes in the Canadian and Australian dollar exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 16% in 2015 compared to an 8% decrease in 2014. The Australian dollar exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar decreased 11% in 2015 compared to an 8% decrease in 2014.\nSegment Results of Operations - Canadian Segment\n\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms includes rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms excludes rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out of service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days. Rentable days excludes staff rooms and out of service rooms. \nOur Canadian segment reported revenues in 2015 that were $317.2 million, or 48%, lower than 2014. The weakening of the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar by 14% in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted in a $51.9 million year over year reduction in revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the weaker Canadian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 38% decline in lodge revenues, primarily due to reduced occupancy and lower room rates, partially offset by the opening of the McClelland Lake Lodge, which commenced operations in the summer of 2014. Mobile, open camp and product revenue decreased due to a reduced number of large projects during 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of weaker Canadian exchange rates, product sales were essentially flat year over year.\nOur Canadian segment cost of sales and services decreased $171.5 million, or 43%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower occupancy, as well as the weakening of the average exchange rates.\nOur Canadian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 39% in 2014 to 33% in 2015, primarily due to lower contracted room rates and occupancy in Canada.\nSegment Results of Operations - Australian Segment\n\n____________\n (1) Includes revenue related to rooms as well as the fees associated with catering, laundry and other services, including facilities management. \n (2) Average available rooms includes rooms that are utilized for our personnel. \n (3) Rentable rooms excludes rooms that are utilized for our personnel and out of service rooms. \n (4) Average daily rate is based on rentable rooms and lodge/village revenue. \n (5) Occupancy represents total billed days divided by rentable days. Rentable days excludes staff rooms and out of service rooms. \nOur Australian segment reported revenues in 2015 that were $77.3 million, or 36%, lower than 2014. The weakening of the average exchange rates for Australian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar by 17% in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted in a $26.5 million year-over-year reduction in revenues. Excluding the impact of the weaker Australian exchange rates, the segment experienced a 19% decline in revenues due to lower occupancy levels in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in mining activity.\nOur Australian segment cost of sales decreased $28.9 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by the weakening of the Australian dollar, as well as lower occupancy levels.\nOur Australian segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 55% in 2015 from 58% in 2014. This was primarily driven by reduced take or pay revenues on expired contracts compared to 2014.\nSegment Results of Operations - U.S. Segment\n\nOur U.S. segment reported revenues in 2015 that were $30.4 million, or 45%, lower than 2014. The reduction was primarily due to lower U.S. drilling activity in the Bakken, Rockies and Texas markets and decreased sales in our offshore business.\nOur U.S. cost of sales decreased $16.9 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by overall lower activity levels, partially offset by a $1.1 million write-down of inventory at our U.S. manufacturing facility.\nOur U.S. segment gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 22% in 2014 to 4% in 2015, primarily due to the $1.1 million inventory write-down, as well as overall lower activity levels.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures, which in the past have included expanding and improving our accommodations, developing new lodges and villages, purchasing or leasing land under our land banking strategy, and for general working capital needs. In addition, capital has been used to repay debt, fund strategic business acquisitions and pay dividends. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been available cash, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from equity issuances. In addition, we may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity, fund acquisitions and refinance debt.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated liquidity position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n______________\n (1) In connection with the February 2017 amendment to the Amended Credit Facility, lender commitments were reduced to $275 million. We also have a A$2.0 million bank guarantee facility. We had bank guarantees of A$0.8 million and A$1.3 million under this facility outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (2) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $144.8 million and $121.7 million, respectively, of our borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Facility could not be utilized in order to maintain compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant in our Amended Credit Facility. \nCash totaling $62.1 million was provided by operations during 2016 compared to $186.1 million provided by operations during 2015 and $291.1 million during 2014. The decreases in operating cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014, respectively, primarily were due to lower revenue resulting from reduced rates and occupancy levels in lodges and villages. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities was $13.6 million during 2016 compared to net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $67.1 million during 2015 and $5.2 million during 2014. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a greater reduction in accounts receivable balances during 2015 than during 2016. The increase in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of decreased accounts receivable balances during 2015 compared to 2014.\nCash was used in investing activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014 in the amounts of $12.7 million, $49.8 million and $239.1 million respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $19.8 million, $62.5 million and $251.2 million respectively. Capital expenditures in 2016 consisted primarily of investments in an enterprise information system and maintenance. Capital expenditures in 2015 consisted principally of costs for the construction and installation of assets for our Sitka lodge in British Columbia and our Mariana Lake lodge in Alberta. Capital expenditures in 2014 consisted principally of construction and installation of assets for our lodges and villages primarily in support of Canadian oil sands projects, including the McClelland Lake Lodge in the Athabasca oil sands region, and Australian mining production and development projects. The significant decrease in capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily a result of the construction of the McClelland Lake Lodge, which was largely completed in 2014. No comparable project was under construction in 2015.\nWe expect our capital expenditures for 2017 to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million, which excludes any expenditures for unannounced and uncommitted projects, the spending for which is contingent on obtaining customer contracts. Whether planned expenditures will actually be spent in 2017 depends on industry conditions, project approvals and schedules, customer room commitments and project and construction timing. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with available cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility. The foregoing capital expenditure forecast does not include any funds for strategic acquisitions, which we could pursue depending on the economic environment in our industry and the availability of transactions at prices deemed to be attractive to us.\nThe table below delineates historical capital expenditures split between development spending on our lodges and villages, land banking spending, mobile and open camp spending and other capital expenditures. We classify capital expenditures for rooms and central facilities at our lodges and villages as development capital expenditures. Land banking spending consists of land acquisition and initial permitting or zoning costs. Other capital expenditures in the table below relate to routine capital spending for support equipment, upgrades to infrastructure at our lodge and village properties and spending related to our manufacturing facilities, among other items. We have also classified the expenditures between expansionary and maintenance spending.\nBased on management's judgment of capital spending classifications, we believe the following table represents the components of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\n\nDevelopment spending in 2015 was primarily related to the construction of our Sitka lodge in British Columbia and our Mariana Lake lodge in Alberta. Development spending in 2014 was primarily related to the construction of our McClelland Lake lodge in the northern Athabasca oil sands region of Canada.\nOpen and mobile camp spending in 2014 was primarily related to additions to our Canadian mobile camp assets, as well as spending on our Antler River open camp in Melita, Manitoba.\nOther spending in 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to investments in an enterprise information system.\nNet cash of $58.3 million was used in financing activities during 2016, primarily due to repayments of term loan borrowings of $41.0 million, net repayments of revolver borrowings of $15.2 million and debt issuance costs of $2.1 million. Net cash of $349.6 million was used in financing activities during 2015, primarily due to repayments of term loan borrowings of $729.4 million, offset by borrowings of term loans of $325 million and net revolver borrowings of $59.1 million. Net cash of $16.2 million was provided by financing activities during 2014, in part due to contributions from Oil States of $28.3 million. Borrowings of $775.0 million under our new term loan facility funded a cash distribution of $750.0 million to Oil States on May 28, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in debt outstanding during 2016 (in thousands):\n\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs in the coming 12 months. If our plans or assumptions change, or are inaccurate, or if we make acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. Acquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, an element of our business strategy. The timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable and uncertain. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with debt and/or equity issuances. Our ability to obtain capital for additional projects to implement our growth strategy over the longer term will depend upon our future operating performance, financial condition and, more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing. Capital availability will be affected by prevailing conditions in our industry, the global economy, the global financial markets and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, such additional debt service requirements could be based on higher interest rates and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to shareholders. In addition, in some cases, we may incur costs to acquire land and/or construct assets without securing a customer contract or prior to finalization of an accommodations contract with a customer. If the contract is not obtained or delayed, the resulting impact could result in an impairment of the related investment.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the offering of $300 million of common shares, preferred shares, debt securities and warrants. On February 7, 2017, we closed a public offering of 23,000,000 common shares at a price to the public of $3.00 per share. We expect to use the net proceeds of $64.9 million from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nCredit Facility and Long Term Debt\nOn February 17, 2017, the third amendment to the Amended Credit Facility became effective, which:\n \u25cf Provide for the reduction by US$75 million of the aggregate revolving loan commitments under the Amended Credit Facility, to a maximum principal amount of $275 million. Accordingly, after the reduction, the revolving credit facility consists of (A) a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, as borrower, (B) a $90.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of Civeo and certain of our Canadian subsidiaries, as borrowers, (C) a $60.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of Civeo, as borrower, and (D) a $85.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of one of our Australian subsidiaries, as borrower; \n \u25cf (i) Established one additional level to the total leverage-based grid such that the interest rates for the loans range from LIBOR +2.25% to LIBOR +5.50% and (ii) increased the undrawn commitment fee from a range of 0.51% to 1.13% to a range of 0.51% to 1.24% based on total leverage; \n \u25cf Adjusted the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant, as follows; and \n\n \u25cf Provided for other technical changes and amendments to the Amended Credit Facility. \nThe following table summarizes the revolving capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility as compared to the second amendment to the Credit Facility (in thousands):\n\nU.S. dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, or a base rate plus 1.25% to 4.50%, in each case based on a ratio of our total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). Canadian dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to CDOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, or a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 4.50%, in each case based on a ratio of our consolidated total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). Australian dollar amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to BBSY plus a margin of 2.25% to 5.50%, based on a ratio of our consolidated total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility).\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict (i) subsidiary indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes, (ii) asset sales, (iii) margin stock, (iv) specified acquisitions, (v) restrictive agreements, (vi) transactions with affiliates and (vii) investments and other restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions. Specifically, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) to consolidated interest expense, of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 5.50 to 1.0 (as of December 31, 2016). As noted above, the permitted level of the maximum leverage ratio changes over time. Each of the factors considered in the calculations of these ratios are defined in the Amended Credit Facility. EBITDA and consolidated interest, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, exclude goodwill and asset impairments, debt discount amortization and other non-cash charges. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nBorrowings under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and all the assets of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are guaranteed by our significant subsidiaries. We have 15 lenders in our Amended Credit Facility with commitments ranging from $1.1 million to $116.5 million.\nDividends\nWe do not currently pay dividends. The declaration and amount of all potential future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in our Amended Credit Facility. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends, and we may incur incremental taxes in the U.S. if we are required to repatriate foreign earnings to pay such dividends. If we elect to pay dividends in the future, the amount per share of our dividend payments may be changed, or dividends may again be suspended, without advance notice. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of market weakness. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nEffects of Inflation\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation in the past three fiscal years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years (in thousands):\n\n (1) Interest payments due under the Amended Credit Facility, which matures on May 28, 2019; based on a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% to 5.2% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016. \nOur debt obligations at December 31, 2016 are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, which is a part of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report. We have not entered into any material leases subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, thus impacting our reported results of operations and financial position. The critical accounting policies and estimates described in this section are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and the application of which requires management's most subjective judgments in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims. These liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts to cover an expected loss. Other claims or liabilities have been estimated based on their fair value or our experience in these matters and, when appropriate, the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts. Upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability. Examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities include litigation, taxes, interest, insurance claims, contract claims and obligations and asset retirement obligations.\nImpairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets, including Goodwill\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid for acquired businesses over the allocated fair value of the related net assets after impairments, if applicable. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, and we reduced the value of our goodwill to zero. Please see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report for further discussion of goodwill impairments recorded in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe do not amortize goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (the component\u201d level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at the component level. Each segment of our business represents a separate reporting unit, and all three of our reporting units previously had goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the reporting unit's implied fair value (IFV) of goodwill. We conduct our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.\nOur assessment consisted of a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compared each reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the IFV of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered impaired, and a second step was performed to determine the amount of impairment. Future impairment tests will be impacted by new accounting guidance which eliminates the second step of the goodwill impairment test.\nWe are given the option to test for impairment of our goodwill by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the currently prescribed two-step impairment test is unnecessary. In developing a qualitative assessment to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold, each reporting unit with goodwill is assessed separately and different relevant events and circumstances are evaluated for each unit. We have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2014, we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the first step of the impairment test. In performing the two-step impairment test, we compare each reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the IFV of the reporting unit. Because none of our reporting units has a publically quoted market price, we must determine the value that willing buyers and sellers would place on the reporting unit through a routine sale process (a Level 3 fair value measurement). In our analysis, we target an IFV that represents the value that would be placed on the reporting unit by market participants, and value the reporting unit based on historical and projected results throughout a cycle, not the value of the reporting unit based on trough or peak earnings. The IFV of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of (i) an analysis of trading multiples of comparable companies (Market Approach) and (ii) discounted projected cash flows (Income Approach). We also use acquisition multiples analyses in certain circumstances. The relative weighting of each approach varies by reporting unit, based on management's judgment.\nMarket Approach - This valuation approach utilizes publicly traded comparable companies' enterprise values, as compared to their recent and forecasted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) information. We have historically used an average EBITDA multiple ranging from approximately 6.5x to approximately 9.5x depending on the reporting unit. We use EBITDA because it is a widely used key indicator of the cash generating capacity of companies in our industry.\nIncome Approach - This valuation approach derives a present value of the reporting unit's projected future annual cash flows over the next five years. We use a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows, including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions, rates, occupancy levels, costs and expenses and capital expenditures. These assumptions vary by each reporting unit depending on market conditions. In addition, a terminal value is estimated, using a Gordon Growth methodology with a long-term growth rate of 3%. We discount our projected cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns that would be required by a market participant.\nThe IFV of our reporting units is affected by future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated spending by our customers and the cost of capital. Our estimate of IFV requires us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances, such as industry and/or local market conditions that might directly impact each reporting unit's operations in the future, and are therefore uncertain. We selected these valuation approaches because we believe the combination of these approaches and our best judgment regarding underlying assumptions and estimates provides us with the best estimate of fair value for each of our reporting units. We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and widely accepted by investors. The IFV of each reporting unit would change if our assumptions under these valuation approaches, or relative weighting of the valuation approaches, were materially modified.\nDefinite-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets. The recoverability of the carrying values of tangible and intangible assets is assessed at an asset group level which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Whenever, in management's judgment, events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset groups may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows, an asset impairment evaluation is performed. Indicators of impairment might include persistent negative economic trends affecting the markets we serve, recurring losses or lowered expectations of future cash flows expected to be generated by our assets.\nIn performing this analysis, the first step is to compare each asset group's carrying value to estimates of undiscounted future cash flows. We use a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows, including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions, rates, occupancy levels, costs and expenses and capital expenditures. The estimates are consistent with those used for purposes of our goodwill impairment test, as further discussed in Goodwill, above.\nIf, based on the assessment, the carrying values of any of our asset groups are determined to not be recoverable, we proceed to the second step. In this step, we compare the fair value of the respective asset group to its carrying value. Our estimate of the fair value requires us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances, such as industry and/or local market conditions that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future, and are therefore uncertain.\nOur industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated, as well as the predictability of these cash flows and our determination of whether a decline in value of our investment has occurred, can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and, in periods of prolonged down cycles, may result in impairment losses. If this assessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset group. The fair value of the asset group is based on prices of similar assets, if available, or discounted cash flows.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator that certain asset groups used, or expected to be used, in conjunction with potential LNG projects in British Columbia may be impaired as a result of recent market developments, including the delay in FID discussed above. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of each of the asset groups to determine if they continued to be recoverable based on their estimated future cash flows. Based on the assessment, the carrying values of our mobile camp assets and certain undeveloped land positions in British Columbia were determined to not be recoverable, and an impairment charge totaling $37.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn estimating future cash flows, we made numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances that might directly impact each of the asset groups' operations in the future and are therefore uncertain. These assumptions with respect to future circumstances included future oil, coal and natural gas prices, anticipated customer spending, and industry and/or local market conditions. These assumptions represented our best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances. However, different assumptions could result in a determination that the carrying values of additional asset groups are no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows for certain of our assets included in this assessment that were not impaired were reduced by 10%, an additional impairment of between $25 million and $35 million could be indicated. Our estimate of fair value was primarily calculated using the Income Approach, which derives a present value of the asset group based on the asset groups' estimated future cash flows. We discounted our estimated future cash flows using a long-term weighted average cost of capital based on our estimate of investment returns required by a market participant.\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impairments of definite-lived tangible and intangible assets recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. We are required to evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In performing the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. The measurement of the impairment is calculated based on the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nPlease see Note 3 - Impairment Charges to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues are recognized based on a periodic (usually daily) room rate or when the services are rendered. Revenues are recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of our contractual relationships with our customers. In some contracts, the rate or committed room numbers may vary over the contract term. In these cases, revenue may be deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Revenue from the sale of products, not accounted for utilizing the percentage-of-completion method, is recognized when delivery to and acceptance by the customer has occurred, when title and all significant risks of ownership have passed to the customer, collectability is probable and pricing is fixed and determinable. Our product sales terms do not include significant post-delivery obligations.\nFor significant projects, revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Billings on such contracts in excess of costs incurred and estimated profits are classified as deferred revenue. Costs incurred and estimated profits in excess of billings on percentage-of-completion contracts are recognized as unbilled receivables. Our management believes this method is the most appropriate measure of progress on large contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to projected costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of our estimates and materially impact our future reported earnings.\nRevenues exclude taxes assessed based on revenues such as sales or value added taxes.\nCost of services includes labor, food, utilities, cleaning supplies and other costs associated with operating the accommodations facilities. Cost of goods sold includes all direct material and labor costs and those costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nEstimation of Useful Lives\nThe selection of the useful lives of many of our assets requires the judgments of our operating personnel as to the length of these useful lives. Our judgment in this area is influenced by our historical experience in operating our assets, technological developments and expectations of future demand for the assets. Should our estimates be too long or short, we might eventually report a disproportionate number of losses or gains upon disposition or retirement of our long-lived assets. We reevaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our assets when certain events occur that directly impact the useful lives and salvage values, including changes in operating condition, functional capability and market and economic factors. We believe our estimates of useful lives are appropriate.\nShare-Based Compensation\nOur historic share-based compensation is based on participating in Civeo's 2014 Equity Participation Plan and, prior to the Spin-Off, the Oil States 2001 Equity Participation Plan (collectively, the Plans). Our disclosures reflect only our employees' participation in the Plans. We are required to estimate the fair value of share compensation made pursuant to awards under the Plans. An initial estimate of the fair value of each option award or restricted share award determines the amount of share compensation expense we will recognize in the future. For stock option awards prior to the Spin-Off, to estimate the value of the awards under the Plan, Oil States selected a fair value calculation model. Oil States chose the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options awarded under the Plan. Oil States chose this model because option awards were made under straightforward vesting terms, option prices and option lives. Utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model required Oil States to estimate the length of time options will remain outstanding, a risk free interest rate for the estimated period options are assumed to be outstanding, forfeiture rates, future dividends and the volatility of our common stock. All of these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future share-based compensation expense recognition. We have not made any option awards subsequent to the Spin-Off, but, in the event that we make future awards, we expect to utilize a similar valuation methodology. We will continually monitor our actual experience and change assumptions for future awards as we consider appropriate.\nWe also grant performance awards under the Civeo Plan. Awards granted in 2016 will be earned in amounts between 0% and 200% of the participant's target performance share award, based on the payout percentage associated with Civeo's relative total shareholder return rank among a peer group of 12 other companies. The fair value of the 2016 awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. We chose this model because the performance awards contain complex vesting terms. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model required us to estimate the risk-free interest rate and the expected market price volatility of our common shares as well as a peer group of companies over a time period equal to the expected term of the award, The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period. For additional details, see Note 15 - Share Based Compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with current accounting standards regarding the accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect at the time the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.\nWhen our earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for Canadian income taxes is made for these earnings. If any of the subsidiaries have a distribution of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both Canadian income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our U.S. foreign subsidiary companies, and recognized a deferred tax liability of $25.3 million as of December 31, 2014 related to a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings. During the third quarter of 2015, following our redomiciliation to Canada, we determined that the existing deferred tax liability recorded was no longer required. We reversed the deferred tax liability and recorded a tax benefit of approximately $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We do not expect to provide Canadian income taxes on future foreign earnings.\nWe record a valuation allowance in each reporting period when our management believes that it is more likely than not that any recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our management will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation allowance in the future, based upon our operating results. Please see Note 12 - Income Taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we are required to estimate a liability for future income taxes for any uncertainty for potential income tax exposures. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.\nFor periods prior to the Spin-Off, our results were included in the consolidated tax return of Oil States. We have determined our U.S. income taxes in the combined financial statements by assuming our results are excluded from the consolidated return and then comparing consolidated taxable income and taxes due with and then without our results. Canadian and Australian taxes are based on actual tax returns filed by our foreign subsidiaries.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

management services to the natural resource industry. Its largest business segments are in Canada and Australia. \n\n- Demand for Civeo's services depends heavily on crude oil and met coal prices, which have declined significantly since 2014, reducing revenues and occupancy. This led to impairment charges in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\n- Revenues decreased 23% in 2016 compared to 2015, largely due to lower rates and occupancy in Canada and Australia. Net loss was $96 million in 2016 compared to $132 million in 2015.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $19.8 million in 2016, focused on maintenance spending. This compares to $62.5 million in 2015 and $251 million in 2014 when more expansionary spending occurred. \n\n- As of December 31, 2016, Civeo had total debt of $357 million and liquidity of $166 million available under its credit facility.\n\n- In 2017, Civeo expects revenues and EBITDA to decline further compared to 2016 due to continued low oil prices and reduced customer spending. It plans to focus on cost management and financial discipline.\n\nIn summary, the MD&A highlights the challenges Civeo faces due to the downturn in its key energy markets, and its strategies to manage through the industry cycle. Performance is expected to remain under pressure in 2017."}
