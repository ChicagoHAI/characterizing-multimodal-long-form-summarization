Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nLivePerson, Inc. ( LivePerson\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d) makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our\ntechnology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.\nThe Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand's primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.\nLivePerson's robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nFor your reference:\n\u2022 Conversational AI: Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text.\n\u2022 Conversational Space: In the Conversational Space, consumers message with brands on their own schedule, using natural language, to resolve their intents - all on their preferred messaging service. The core capabilities\nof the Conversational Space are voice and text-based interfaces, powered by AI and humans working together. Conversational Space is the simplest, most intuitive interface of all.\n\u2022 Conversational Cloud: LivePerson's enterprise-class, AI-powered Conversational Cloud platform empowers consumers to message their favorite brands, just as they do with friends and family.\nLivePerson's Conversational AI offerings put the power of bot development, training, management and analysis into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call the tango\u201d of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.\nComplementing our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings are teams of technical, solutions and consulting professionals that have developed deep domain expertise in the implementation and optimization of conversational services across industries and messaging endpoints. We are a leading authority in the Conversational Space. LivePerson's products, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the effectiveness of the Conversational Space and deliver measurable return on investment. Certain of our customers have achieved the following advantages from our offerings:\n\u2022the ability for each agent to manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed;\n\u2022labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor costs by at least 50%;\n\u2022improving the overall customer experience, thereby fueling customer satisfaction increases of up to 20 percentage points, and enhancing retention and loyalty;\n\u2022more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations that increase sales conversion by up to 20%, increase average order value and reduce abandonment;\n\u2022more satisfied contact center agents, thereby reducing agent churn by up to 50%;\n\u2022maintain a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms;\n\u2022leverage spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions;\n\u2022refine and improve performance by understanding which initiatives deliver the highest rate of return; and\n\u2022increase lead generation by providing a single platform that engages consumers through advertisements and listings on branded and third-party websites.\nAs a cloud computing\u201d or software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.\nTo further enhance our platform, in September 2020 we signed a partnership with Infosys, a leader in next-generation\ndigital services and consulting. We will work with Infosys to transform our technology infrastructure on the public cloud, to\nbuild integrated solutions and a global practice around our Conversational Cloud to sell into their channels and global enterprise\ncustomer base, and to redefine how the world's top brands communicate.\nMore than 18,000 businesses, including HSBC, Orange, The Home Depot, and GM Financial use our conversational solutions to orchestrate humans and AI, at scale, and create a convenient, deeply personal relationship with their customers.\nLivePerson's consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers\n(Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and\nprogramming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.\nThe key elements of LivePerson's business solutions strategy include:\nBuild awareness and drive adoption of the Conversational Space. LivePerson brought our first customer live on messaging in June 2016. Since that time, we have been focused on building awareness for conversational experiences and driving adoption. We have educated businesses on the financial and operational transformation that occurs when a contact center shifts to an asynchronous messaging environment, where the consumer controls the pace of the conversation, which can last minutes, hours or days, from a synchronous call or chat center, where conversations occur in real-time and have a distinct start and end.\nA key component of our industry awareness marketing strategy has been to hold multiple global customer summits each year (events in 2020 were held virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic) that target executives from enterprise customers and prospects, and feature a key theme within the Conversational Space, such as Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, IVR deflection or AI. LivePerson customers are the centerpoint of these summits, presenting why they chose LivePerson for conversational experiences, how they achieved success, and what type of ROI they have realized. Each attendee then receives a blueprint for how they can achieve similar outcomes. We have found this strategy to drive strong results for LivePerson, as we have seen a greater than 40% conversion rate on opportunities that were created or advanced as part of the customer summits. By year-end 2020, we had brought approximately 400 customers live on messaging and increased adoption within our enterprise customers to 66%. In addition, nearly 70% of messaging conversations had automation attached. We will continue to focus on building awareness for the Conversational Space and driving adoption of messaging and AI across our customer base.\nIncrease messaging volumes by developing a broad ecosystem, expanding customer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation. Our strategy is to drive higher messaging volumes by going both wide across messaging endpoints, deep across consumer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation as the means to deliver powerful scale. LivePerson offers a platform usage pricing model, where customers are offered access to our entire suite of messaging technologies across their entire agent pool for a pre-negotiated cost per interaction. We believe that over time this model will drive higher revenue for LivePerson by reducing barriers to adoption of new messaging endpoints and use cases.\nIn order to drive broad messaging adoption, it is imperative that the Conversational Cloud integrates to all of the messaging apps that consumers prefer to use for communication and addresses all key use cases. For example, if a consumer is\nan avid WhatsApp user, and a brand only offers SMS as a messaging option, that consumer may be reluctant to try messaging the brand. Therefore, a key strategy of ours has been to build one of the industry's broadest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases. In June 2016, we launched with In-App messaging. In 2017, we introduced Facebook Messenger, SMS, Web messaging and IVR deflection integrations. In 2018, we added Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, Google Ad Lingo and Twitter. In 2019, we added email, allowing brands to manage emails through the same console they use for messaging, and to convert legacy emails into messaging conversations. We also added social monitoring and conversational tools for Twitter and Facebook, and introduced proactive messaging, allowing brands to transform traditional one-way notifications such as flight cancellations or phone plan overage alerts into two-way conversations. Finally, we connected to Facebook and WhatsApp digital advertisements, enabling consumers to initiate messaging conversations for marketing and customer care directly within the advertisement. In 2020, we added Instagram and Google's Business Messages, allowing brands to bring customer-initiated conversations into the Conversational Cloud directly from Instagram, Google Search, and Google Maps.\nEach channel and use case added opens the door to hundreds of millions of new consumers, providing brands a greater opportunity to shift share away from their legacy contact center channels into messaging. For example, in 2019, leading airlines launched on WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat with the ability to make secure payments; a baseball stadium launched an automated conversational concierge providing answers to a wide range of questions from restroom locations to player stats; and a multinational telecommunications company used proactive two-way messaging for outbound campaigns. In 2020, one of the largest telcos in Australia fully virtualized their contact centers, a leading U.S. quick-serve restaurant launched on Facebook Messenger to help customers order meals, one of the biggest banks in the world launched an Apple Business Chat channel to provide a secure way to perform day-to-day banking, and one of the world's largest jewelry retailers used the Conversational Cloud and QR codes to sell millions of dollars of product.\nLivePerson makes the management of all these disparate channels seamless to the brand. AI-based intelligent routing, queuing and prioritization software orchestrates these conversations at scale, regardless of which messaging endpoint they originated from, so that human and bot agents can engage with all customers through just one console.\nWe believe LivePerson is leading the structural shift to Conversational AI. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising and brick and mortar. Our Conversational AI leadership and the increase in adoption have influenced LivePerson's enterprise and mid-market revenue retention rate, (the trailing-twelve-month change in total revenue from existing customers after upsells, downsells and attrition) which exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% for 2020. The benefit can also be seen in LivePerson's average revenue per user (ARPU) for our enterprise and mid-market customers, which increased approximately 35% in 2020 to $465,000 from approximately $345,000 in 2019.\nAttract the industry's best AI, machine learning and conversational talent. We believe that AI and machine learning are critical to successfully scaling in the Conversational Space, and that in order to develop the industry's leading technology, we need to attract the industry's best talent. In 2018, LivePerson recruited Alex Spinelli, key architect of the Alexa Operating System at Amazon.com, as our Global CTO. Under Mr. Spinelli's leadership, LivePerson hired more than 280 of the industry's brightest data scientists, machine learning engineers and automation engineers, many from firms such as Nike, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Target, who are working exclusively on applying AI to the Conversational Space. LivePerson also expanded its development talent base in Germany, and added key development talent through the acquisitions of BotCentral in Mountain View, California and Conversable in Austin, Texas.\nBring to market best-in-class AI and machine learning technologies designed for the conversational space. We believe that in the last decade many vendors introduced AI and bot offerings that created frustrating experiences for consumers and businesses alike, which in turn has eroded trust in automation. Many of these solutions have proven difficult to build and scale, and have been limited by stand-alone implementations that lacked the measurement, reporting and human oversight of conversational platforms such as the Conversational Cloud. In December 2018, LivePerson announced its patent pending AI engine that is designed to overcome these shortcomings and help brands rapidly bring to market conversational AI that can scale to millions of interactions, while increasing customer satisfaction and conversion rates.\nUnlike alternative solutions designed solely for IT departments, LivePerson's Conversational AI was built to be used by developers and contact center agents. By putting the power of conversational design and bot management in the hands of contact center agents, LivePerson's Conversational AI gives brands the ability to leverage the employees closest to the customer, those who are most versed in the voice of the brand, and with the most expertise in how to craft successful outcomes for customer service and sales journeys.\nSome of the key innovations behind LivePerson's Conversational AI include:\n\u2022a holistic approach to scaling AI by combining consumer facing bots, agent facing bots, intelligent routing and real-time intent understanding, with an analytics dashboard that helps users focus on the intents that are impacting their business and prioritize which intents to automate next;\n\u2022bot building software that is based on dialogue instead of workflow or code, so non-technical employees like contact center agents can design automations;\n\u2022leveraging data moat from hundreds of millions of conversations to feed the machine learning that rapidly and accurately detects consumer sentiment and intents in real-time. Customers of LivePerson can use intent understanding for advanced routing, next-best actions, and to fully contain conversations with automation;\n\u2022the establishing of contact center agents as bot managers, ensuring that every conversation is safeguarded by a human and that agents are continuously training the AI to be smarter and drive more successful outcomes;\n\u2022powerful Assist technology that multiplies the efficiency of agents by analyzing intents in real time and then suggesting next best actions, predefined content, and bots that can take over transactional work;\n\u2022pre-built templates for target verticals that provide out of the box support for the top intents and back-end integrations;\n\u2022the ability to bootstrap conversations with existing transcripts, reducing design effort and speeding time to market;\n\u2022third-party AI natural language understanding (NLU) integration, so customers aren't boxed into one vendor;\n\u2022AI analytics and reporting tailored to the Conversational Space, providing brands with immediate, actionable insights about their businesses and contact center operations.\nOur strategy is to continue to enhance the Conversational AI engine and related products, by leveraging our global R&D footprint and substantial library of mobile and online conversational data, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.\nSustain our leadership position by aligning brands to a vision that transforms how they communicate with consumers and delivers a superior return on investment. We believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as a feature. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson holds the perspective that messaging and AI are the foundation for transforming conversational experiences, disrupting how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done correctly, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, emails and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nWe believe that LivePerson is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformation due to our technology and expertise:\n\u2022The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson's enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers.\n\u2022The Company has a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding.\n\u2022The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising and brick and mortar.\n\u2022LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space. We have developed a Transformation Model that is introduced to existing and prospective customers to help guide them on their journeys from legacy and often times inefficient legacy voice, email and chat solutions to modern conversational ones powered by messaging and AI.\nWe believe that LivePerson's differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise has established us as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment. LivePerson customers manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed. Our customers often see labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor\ncosts by at least 50%. Furthermore, our ability to deliver more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations often drives increases in customer satisfaction of up to 20 percentage points and increases in sales conversions of up to 20%, while\nenhancing average order value, customer retention and loyalty.\nStrengthen our position in both existing and new industries. We plan to continue to develop our market position by increasing our customer base, and expanding within our installed base. We will continue to focus primarily on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology and automotive within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the small business (SMB) sector. In 2019, we made strong inroads into new verticals with key wins in the airline, food service and healthcare industries. In 2020, we strengthened our presence in key markets including travel/hospitality and retail, and opened new verticals like healthcare and government. We are experimenting\nwith new conversational businesses, including some that are in regulated industries, like online banking. We are increasingly structuring our field organization to emphasize our domain expertise and strengthen customer relationships across target industries.\nContinue to build our international presence. We are focused on building our international presence and expanding our international revenue contribution, which accounted for 38% and 41% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are generating positive results from our recent investments in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America regions.\nLeverage our open architecture to support partners and developers. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. We integrate into third-party messaging endpoints including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, WeChat, Google Ad Lingo, Google Search, Google Maps, Instagram and Twitter, multiple IVR vendors and dozens of branded apps. The Conversational Cloud integrates our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI with third-party bot offerings, empowering our customers to manage a mix of different bots, human agents and technologies from one control panel, thereby optimizing contact center efficiency. LivePerson's proprietary and third-party AI/bots enable brands to partially or fully automate communications with their customers.\nIn addition, we have opened up access to our platform and our products with more than 40 APIs and software development kits that allow customers and third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2019, we launched LivePerson Functions, a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) integration which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within LivePerson's conversational platform to easily and rapidly tailor conversation flows to their specific needs.\nExpand sales partnerships to broaden our presence and accelerate sales cycles. We are focused on broadening our market reach and accelerating sales cycles by partnering with systems integrators, technology providers, business process outsourcers, value added resellers and other sales partners. We formalized a relationship with IBM Global Business Services in 2017 and Accenture in 2018. In 2019, we announced strategic partnerships with TTEC, a leading BPO focused on customer experience, and DMI, a digital transformation company, to redefine the customer experience with digital engagement, messaging, and AI-driven automation. In 2020, Infosys joined LivePerson's network with a first-of-its-kind 360-degree partnership focusing not only on capturing the global rising demand for conversational commerce and building a personalized experience for customers, but also driving the transformation for internal corporate messaging and the employee experience through Conversational AI. LivePerson increased the number of partners focused on SMBs to more than 300 at year-end 2020 and 2019, from over 150 at year-end 2018, and approximately 40 at the end of 2017. Approximately one quarter of all opportunities were influenced by partners in 2020, and we are focused on driving that contribution toward 50% longer term.\nMaintain market leadership in technology and security expertise. As described above, we are devoting significant resources to creating new products and enabling technologies designed to accelerate innovation. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in order to retain our leadership position in each market we serve. We monitor legal and technological developments in the area of information security and confidentiality to ensure our policies and procedures meet or exceed the demands of the world's largest and most demanding corporations. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing customer and consumer requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.\nEvaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions when appropriate. We have successfully integrated several acquisitions over the past decade. While we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, engage in discussions regarding acquisitions or strategic transactions or to acquire other companies that can accelerate our growth or broaden our product offerings, we currently have no binding commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or strategic transactions.\n.\nKey Metrics\nFinancial overview of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the comparable periods in 2019 is as follows:\n\u2022Revenue increased 29% and 26% to $102.1 million and $366.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $79.1 million and $291.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue from our Business segment increased 29% and 26% to $94.1 million and $336.9 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $72.8 million and $267.1 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Gross profit margin increased to 73% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 from 72% in the comparable period in 2019. Gross profit margin decreased to 71% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from 73% in the comparable period in 2019.\n\u2022Cost and expenses increased 5% and 20% to $108.8 million and $456.1 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $103.6 million and $378.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Net loss increased to $13.3 million and to $107.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from net loss of $27.3 million and $96.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Trailing-twelve-month average revenue per enterprise and mid-market customer was approximately $465,000 in 2020, as compared to approximately $345,000 in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue retention rate for enterprise and mid-market customers on Conversational Cloud exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% in 2020, and was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2019.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the LivePerson services. We charge a monthly fee, which varies by service and customer usage. The majority of our larger customers also pay a professional services fee related to implementation and ongoing optimization services. A large proportion of our revenue from new customers comes from large corporations. These companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards. Such customers also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements, and are likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nFor more information about our revenue recognition policies, please see -- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n-- Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nRevenue attributable to our monthly hosted Business services accounted for 78% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 77% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 79% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nRevenue attributable to professional services accounted for 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nRevenue from our Consumer segment accounted for approximately 8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance. The decrease of $0.1 million in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by satisfying our performance obligations and the revenue recognized of approximately $103.2 million that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost of revenue consists of:\n\u2022compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer support and implementation services to our customers;\n\u2022outside labor provider costs;\n\u2022compensation costs relating to our network support staff;\n\u2022depreciation of certain hardware and software;\n\u2022allocated occupancy costs and related overhead;\n\u2022the cost of supporting our infrastructure, including expenses related to server leases, infrastructure support costs and Internet connectivity;\n\u2022the credit card fees and related payment processing costs associated with the consumer and SMB services; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangibles.\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales personnel and marketing personnel, online marketing, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, advertising, sales commissions, public relations, promotional materials, travel expenses, global customer summits and trade show exhibit expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, legal, information technology and human resources personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, litigation, professional fees, provision for doubtful accounts and other general corporate expenses.\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software. Product development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\nDuring 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. During 2019, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $2.3 million to approximately $3.1 million. We perform a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers, among other factors, the aging of the accounts receivable, historical write-offs and the creditworthiness of each customer. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nNon-Cash Compensation Expense\nThe net non-cash compensation amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consist of (amounts in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nWe are organized into two operating segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Business segment enables brands to leverage the Conversational Cloud sophisticated intelligence engine to connect with consumers through an integrated suite of mobile and online business messaging technologies.

These increases were offset in part by a decrease in allocated occupancy costs, related overhead, information technology, and other general corporate expenses of approximately $1.9 million.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel as well as allocated occupancy costs and related overhead and outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headcount (at period end) </td> <td>467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct development costs increased by 32% to $108.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily related to an increase in salaries and employee related expenses of approximately $11.9 million, in business services and outsourcing subcontracted labor of approximately $8.6 million, in backup server facilities of approximately $1.1 million related to costs supporting our backup servers and in depreciation expense of approximately $5.0 million. The Company made investments in public cloud migration, and in enhancing and expanding new features of the Conversational Cloud. Also, the Company invested in bringing more data scientists and machine learning engineers to focus on Conversational Al.\nProduct development costs increased by 47% to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily related to an increase in compensation, recruitment, and related costs of approximately $15.3 million, as the Company built out its Seattle Advanced Technology Center, ending 2019 with more than 125 data scientists, machine learnings engineers and automation engineers focused on Conversational AI. The increase was also related to an increase in outsourced labor of approximately $5.0 million, primarily tied to supporting demand\nfor technical services. Facility, allocated occupancy costs and overhead related to costs of supporting our server and network infrastructure increased approximately $4.3 million, depreciation expenses increased approximately $1.5 million, and marketing related costs increased $0.3 million.\nWe continue to invest in new product development efforts to expand the capability of the Conversational Cloud. In accordance with ASC 350-40, \u2018\u2018Internal- Use Software'', as new projects are initiated that provide functionality to the Conversational Cloud platform, the associated development and employee costs will be capitalized. Upon completion, the project costs will be depreciated over five years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $33.9 million and $29.1 million was capitalized, respectively.\nRestructuring Costs\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring Costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,340 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring costs increased by 1,340% to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to an increase in restructuring costs related to lease abandonment of approximately $24.1 million, along with severance and other compensation costs of approximately $5.3 million.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company went through a re-evaluation of our real estate needs. In connection with this re-evaluation, and the success we have had working remotely, it was decided in July 2020 that we would significantly reduce the real estate space we lease. This decision resulted in the significant reduction of the real estate space we lease and the removal of the associated right of use assets (\"ROU assets\"). Furthermore, this resulted in various one-time expenses in connection with the abandonment of the majority of our leased facilities. The lease restructuring costs noted above are a result of this transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nRestructuring costs decreased by 54% to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to a decrease in severance and other associated costs of approximately $2.5 million. Severance costs are associated with re-prioritizing and reallocating resources to focus on areas showing high growth potential.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of purchased intangibles </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization expense for purchased intangibles decreased by 9% to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased by 7% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The year over year variance is primarily attributable to amortization of patents and customer relationships.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents, investment income and financial (expense) income which is a result of currency rate fluctuations associated with exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar against the New Israeli Shekel, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian dollar and the Euro.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (expense) income </td> <td>(14,334) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,768) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,343) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(211) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(493) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(346) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,677) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,194) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,194) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(471) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,215 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (expense) income increased by $9.5 million to an expense of $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u2018\u20182024 Notes''), offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nOther (expense) income increased by $5.7 million to an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 2024 Notes, offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense decreased by 13% to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2020, we recognized a benefit of $0.6 million due to net operating loss and research and development credits carryback resulting from the CARES Act. The decrease in tax expense is primarily due to these factors.\nIncome tax expense increased by 232% to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2018, we recognized a benefit of $2.0 million related to a settlement with the Israeli Tax Authority. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a benefit as the recorded liability was less than the final settlement. A benefit was also recorded for U.S. federal tax refunds that were recognized due to increased foreign tax credits and increased federal NOLs from foreign tax deductions. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to these factors.\nNet Loss\nWe had a net loss of $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue increased approximately $75.0 million, operating expenses increased by approximately $77.4 million, the provision for income taxes decreased approximately $0.4 million, and other (expense) income net increased by $9.5 million, contributing to a net increase in net loss of approximately $11.5 million.\nWe had a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue increased approximately $41.8 million, operating expenses increased by approximately $105.1 million, the provision for income taxes increased approximately $2.0 million, and other (expense) income, net decreased by approximately $5.7 million, contributing to a net increase in net loss of approximately $71.0 million.\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Company's financial information for the eight most recent quarters ended December 31, 2020.

from December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to cash provided by financing activities relating to issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the issuance of common stock. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, fixed assets for our co-location facilities, capitalization of internally developed software, debt issuance costs, and increases in prepaid expenses and accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $33.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net loss was $107.6 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in operating lease liability due to the transition to an employee centric model under which employees will work remotely, and increase in accrued expenses and decrease in accounts receivable. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and decrease in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was $59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss was $96.1 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in deferred revenue due to more of our customers moving to cash payments in advance on annual billings and in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and accounts receivable, and decrease in deferred tax liability.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities was $48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $483.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from issuance of the 2026 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and payment of our finance lease. The net proceeds of the 2026 Notes was approximately $506.6 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash provided by financing activities was $217.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and repurchase of our common stock. The net proceeds of the 2024 Notes was approximately $221.4 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2024 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds prior to such time, and we would then seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through public financings, or seek alternative sources of financing. We cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, when needed, if at all. If we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing, we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion, to develop new or enhanced services or products, or to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any special purposes entities, and other than operating leases, which are described below we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating and finance leases. These leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance. Total lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was approximately $13.5 million, $13.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal commitments were approximately $24.4 million under various operating and finance leases, of which approximately $10.2 million is due in 2021. We currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ending December 31, 2021 will not exceed approximately $10.2 million in the aggregate.\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our convertible senior notes.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal capital expenditures in 2020 were approximately $41.6 million, primarily related to software capitalization and to the continued expansion of our co-location facilities. Our total capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed $47.3 million in 2021. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures.\nIndemnifications\nWe enter into service and license agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to some of these agreements, we agree to indemnify certain customers from and against certain types of claims and losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of using our products.\nWe also have agreements whereby our executive officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Currently, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available. We base these estimates on our historical experience, future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any differences could be material. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of our services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTotal revenue of $366.6 million, $291.6 million, and $249.8 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nHosted Services Business revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration expected to be received and primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to the Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class, cloud-based platform. We have determined such access represents a stand-ready service provided continually throughout the contract term. As such, control and satisfaction of this stand-ready performance obligation is deemed to occur over time. We recognize this revenue over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that access to the Conversational Cloud platform is made available to the customer. The passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control of the services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by our performance. Subscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Additionally, for certain of our larger customers, we may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified vendors. For most of these customers, we pass the fee we incur with the labor provider and its fee for the hosted services through to our customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via our online engagement solutions. For these Gainshare (formerly Pay for Performance\u201d) arrangements in accordance with ASC-606, \u2018\u2018Principal Agent Considerations,'' we act as a principal in a transaction if we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training delivered on an on-demand basis which is deemed to represent a distinct stand-ready performance obligation. Professional Services Revenues are reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Control for the majority of our Professional Services contracts passes over time to the customer and is recognized ratably over the contracted period, as the passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control. For certain deployment services, which are not deemed to represent a distinct performance obligation, revenue will be recognized in the same manner as the fee for access to the Conversational Cloud platform, and as such will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. For services billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed using time and materials as the measure of progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Professional service contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nFor revenue from our Consumer segment generated from online transactions between Experts and Users, revenue is recognized at an amount net of Expert fees in accordance with ASC 606, Principal Agent Considerations,\u201d due primarily to the fact that we do not act as a principal in a transaction since we do not control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. Additionally, we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection, and we are not involved in selecting the Expert or establishing the Expert's fee. We collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee, and then remit the balance to the Expert. Revenue from these transactions is recognized at the point in time when the transaction is complete and no significant performance obligations remain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe follow ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation,\u201d which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $17.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $66.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition (except for customers who purchase the LivePerson services by credit card via Internet download) and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable, although they may change in the future. If there is a deterioration of a customer's credit worthiness or actual write-offs are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected. Although our large number of customers limits our concentration of credit risk, if we experience a significant write-off from one of our large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018 . No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2020 and 2018. Two customers exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2019. During 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as two reporting units and has selected September 30 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nNo goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, capitalized internal-use software, costs to obtain customer contracts, and acquired intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was a loss on disposal of approximately $5.1 million in October 2020. The Company recognized accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that were determined to no longer be of future economic benefit to the Company based on the decision to vacate the leased office space.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to become deductible. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We include interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses. We recorded a valuation allowance as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $6.9 million.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Periodically, we evaluate the status of each legal matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance. As a result, the assessment of a potential liability and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the legal proceeding or litigation, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 13, Legal Matters, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our legal proceedings and litigation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently issued accounting standards.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nLivePerson, Inc. ( LivePerson\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d) makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our\ntechnology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.\nThe Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand's primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.\nLivePerson's robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nFor your reference:\n\u2022 Conversational AI: Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text.\n\u2022 Conversational Space: In the Conversational Space, consumers message with brands on their own schedule, using natural language, to resolve their intents - all on their preferred messaging service. The core capabilities\nof the Conversational Space are voice and text-based interfaces, powered by AI and humans working together. Conversational Space is the simplest, most intuitive interface of all.\n\u2022 Conversational Cloud: LivePerson's enterprise-class, AI-powered Conversational Cloud platform empowers consumers to message their favorite brands, just as they do with friends and family.\nLivePerson's Conversational AI offerings put the power of bot development, training, management and analysis into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call the tango\u201d of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.\nComplementing our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings are teams of technical, solutions and consulting professionals that have developed deep domain expertise in the implementation and optimization of conversational services across industries and messaging endpoints. We are a leading authority in the Conversational Space. LivePerson's products, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the effectiveness of the Conversational Space and deliver measurable return on investment. Certain of our customers have achieved the following advantages from our offerings:\n\u2022the ability for each agent to manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed;\n\u2022labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor costs by at least 50%;\n\u2022improving the overall customer experience, thereby fueling customer satisfaction increases of up to 20 percentage points, and enhancing retention and loyalty;\n\u2022more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations that increase sales conversion by up to 20%, increase average order value and reduce abandonment;\n\u2022more satisfied contact center agents, thereby reducing agent churn by up to 50%;\n\u2022maintain a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms;\n\u2022leverage spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions;\n\u2022refine and improve performance by understanding which initiatives deliver the highest rate of return; and\n\u2022increase lead generation by providing a single platform that engages consumers through advertisements and listings on branded and third-party websites.\nAs a cloud computing\u201d or software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.\nTo further enhance our platform, in September 2020 we signed a partnership with Infosys, a leader in next-generation\ndigital services and consulting. We will work with Infosys to transform our technology infrastructure on the public cloud, to\nbuild integrated solutions and a global practice around our Conversational Cloud to sell into their channels and global enterprise\ncustomer base, and to redefine how the world's top brands communicate.\nMore than 18,000 businesses, including HSBC, Orange, The Home Depot, and GM Financial use our conversational solutions to orchestrate humans and AI, at scale, and create a convenient, deeply personal relationship with their customers.\nLivePerson's consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers\n(Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and\nprogramming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.\nThe key elements of LivePerson's business solutions strategy include:\nBuild awareness and drive adoption of the Conversational Space. LivePerson brought our first customer live on messaging in June 2016. Since that time, we have been focused on building awareness for conversational experiences and driving adoption. We have educated businesses on the financial and operational transformation that occurs when a contact center shifts to an asynchronous messaging environment, where the consumer controls the pace of the conversation, which can last minutes, hours or days, from a synchronous call or chat center, where conversations occur in real-time and have a distinct start and end.\nA key component of our industry awareness marketing strategy has been to hold multiple global customer summits each year (events in 2020 were held virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic) that target executives from enterprise customers and prospects, and feature a key theme within the Conversational Space, such as Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, IVR deflection or AI. LivePerson customers are the centerpoint of these summits, presenting why they chose LivePerson for conversational experiences, how they achieved success, and what type of ROI they have realized. Each attendee then receives a blueprint for how they can achieve similar outcomes. We have found this strategy to drive strong results for LivePerson, as we have seen a greater than 40% conversion rate on opportunities that were created or advanced as part of the customer summits. By year-end 2020, we had brought approximately 400 customers live on messaging and increased adoption within our enterprise customers to 66%. In addition, nearly 70% of messaging conversations had automation attached. We will continue to focus on building awareness for the Conversational Space and driving adoption of messaging and AI across our customer base.\nIncrease messaging volumes by developing a broad ecosystem, expanding customer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation. Our strategy is to drive higher messaging volumes by going both wide across messaging endpoints, deep across consumer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation as the means to deliver powerful scale. LivePerson offers a platform usage pricing model, where customers are offered access to our entire suite of messaging technologies across their entire agent pool for a pre-negotiated cost per interaction. We believe that over time this model will drive higher revenue for LivePerson by reducing barriers to adoption of new messaging endpoints and use cases.\nIn order to drive broad messaging adoption, it is imperative that the Conversational Cloud integrates to all of the messaging apps that consumers prefer to use for communication and addresses all key use cases. For example, if a consumer is\nan avid WhatsApp user, and a brand only offers SMS as a messaging option, that consumer may be reluctant to try messaging the brand. Therefore, a key strategy of ours has been to build one of the industry's broadest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases. In June 2016, we launched with In-App messaging. In 2017, we introduced Facebook Messenger, SMS, Web messaging and IVR deflection integrations. In 2018, we added Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, Google Ad Lingo and Twitter. In 2019, we added email, allowing brands to manage emails through the same console they use for messaging, and to convert legacy emails into messaging conversations. We also added social monitoring and conversational tools for Twitter and Facebook, and introduced proactive messaging, allowing brands to transform traditional one-way notifications such as flight cancellations or phone plan overage alerts into two-way conversations. Finally, we connected to Facebook and WhatsApp digital advertisements, enabling consumers to initiate messaging conversations for marketing and customer care directly within the advertisement. In 2020, we added Instagram and Google's Business Messages, allowing brands to bring customer-initiated conversations into the Conversational Cloud directly from Instagram, Google Search, and Google Maps.\nEach channel and use case added opens the door to hundreds of millions of new consumers, providing brands a greater opportunity to shift share away from their legacy contact center channels into messaging. For example, in 2019, leading airlines launched on WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat with the ability to make secure payments; a baseball stadium launched an automated conversational concierge providing answers to a wide range of questions from restroom locations to player stats; and a multinational telecommunications company used proactive two-way messaging for outbound campaigns. In 2020, one of the largest telcos in Australia fully virtualized their contact centers, a leading U.S. quick-serve restaurant launched on Facebook Messenger to help customers order meals, one of the biggest banks in the world launched an Apple Business Chat channel to provide a secure way to perform day-to-day banking, and one of the world's largest jewelry retailers used the Conversational Cloud and QR codes to sell millions of dollars of product.\nLivePerson makes the management of all these disparate channels seamless to the brand. AI-based intelligent routing, queuing and prioritization software orchestrates these conversations at scale, regardless of which messaging endpoint they originated from, so that human and bot agents can engage with all customers through just one console.\nWe believe LivePerson is leading the structural shift to Conversational AI. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising and brick and mortar. Our Conversational AI leadership and the increase in adoption have influenced LivePerson's enterprise and mid-market revenue retention rate, (the trailing-twelve-month change in total revenue from existing customers after upsells, downsells and attrition) which exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% for 2020. The benefit can also be seen in LivePerson's average revenue per user (ARPU) for our enterprise and mid-market customers, which increased approximately 35% in 2020 to $465,000 from approximately $345,000 in 2019.\nAttract the industry's best AI, machine learning and conversational talent. We believe that AI and machine learning are critical to successfully scaling in the Conversational Space, and that in order to develop the industry's leading technology, we need to attract the industry's best talent. In 2018, LivePerson recruited Alex Spinelli, key architect of the Alexa Operating System at Amazon.com, as our Global CTO. Under Mr. Spinelli's leadership, LivePerson hired more than 280 of the industry's brightest data scientists, machine learning engineers and automation engineers, many from firms such as Nike, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Target, who are working exclusively on applying AI to the Conversational Space. LivePerson also expanded its development talent base in Germany, and added key development talent through the acquisitions of BotCentral in Mountain View, California and Conversable in Austin, Texas.\nBring to market best-in-class AI and machine learning technologies designed for the conversational space. We believe that in the last decade many vendors introduced AI and bot offerings that created frustrating experiences for consumers and businesses alike, which in turn has eroded trust in automation. Many of these solutions have proven difficult to build and scale, and have been limited by stand-alone implementations that lacked the measurement, reporting and human oversight of conversational platforms such as the Conversational Cloud. In December 2018, LivePerson announced its patent pending AI engine that is designed to overcome these shortcomings and help brands rapidly bring to market conversational AI that can scale to millions of interactions, while increasing customer satisfaction and conversion rates.\nUnlike alternative solutions designed solely for IT departments, LivePerson's Conversational AI was built to be used by developers and contact center agents. By putting the power of conversational design and bot management in the hands of contact center agents, LivePerson's Conversational AI gives brands the ability to leverage the employees closest to the customer, those who are most versed in the voice of the brand, and with the most expertise in how to craft successful outcomes for customer service and sales journeys.\nSome of the key innovations behind LivePerson's Conversational AI include:\n\u2022a holistic approach to scaling AI by combining consumer facing bots, agent facing bots, intelligent routing and real-time intent understanding, with an analytics dashboard that helps users focus on the intents that are impacting their business and prioritize which intents to automate next;\n\u2022bot building software that is based on dialogue instead of workflow or code, so non-technical employees like contact center agents can design automations;\n\u2022leveraging data moat from hundreds of millions of conversations to feed the machine learning that rapidly and accurately detects consumer sentiment and intents in real-time. Customers of LivePerson can use intent understanding for advanced routing, next-best actions, and to fully contain conversations with automation;\n\u2022the establishing of contact center agents as bot managers, ensuring that every conversation is safeguarded by a human and that agents are continuously training the AI to be smarter and drive more successful outcomes;\n\u2022powerful Assist technology that multiplies the efficiency of agents by analyzing intents in real time and then suggesting next best actions, predefined content, and bots that can take over transactional work;\n\u2022pre-built templates for target verticals that provide out of the box support for the top intents and back-end integrations;\n\u2022the ability to bootstrap conversations with existing transcripts, reducing design effort and speeding time to market;\n\u2022third-party AI natural language understanding (NLU) integration, so customers aren't boxed into one vendor;\n\u2022AI analytics and reporting tailored to the Conversational Space, providing brands with immediate, actionable insights about their businesses and contact center operations.\nOur strategy is to continue to enhance the Conversational AI engine and related products, by leveraging our global R&D footprint and substantial library of mobile and online conversational data, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.\nSustain our leadership position by aligning brands to a vision that transforms how they communicate with consumers and delivers a superior return on investment. We believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as a feature. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson holds the perspective that messaging and AI are the foundation for transforming conversational experiences, disrupting how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done correctly, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, emails and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nWe believe that LivePerson is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformation due to our technology and expertise:\n\u2022The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson's enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers.\n\u2022The Company has a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding.\n\u2022The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising and brick and mortar.\n\u2022LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space. We have developed a Transformation Model that is introduced to existing and prospective customers to help guide them on their journeys from legacy and often times inefficient legacy voice, email and chat solutions to modern conversational ones powered by messaging and AI.\nWe believe that LivePerson's differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise has established us as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment. LivePerson customers manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed. Our customers often see labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor\ncosts by at least 50%. Furthermore, our ability to deliver more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations often drives increases in customer satisfaction of up to 20 percentage points and increases in sales conversions of up to 20%, while\nenhancing average order value, customer retention and loyalty.\nStrengthen our position in both existing and new industries. We plan to continue to develop our market position by increasing our customer base, and expanding within our installed base. We will continue to focus primarily on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology and automotive within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the small business (SMB) sector. In 2019, we made strong inroads into new verticals with key wins in the airline, food service and healthcare industries. In 2020, we strengthened our presence in key markets including travel/hospitality and retail, and opened new verticals like healthcare and government. We are experimenting\nwith new conversational businesses, including some that are in regulated industries, like online banking. We are increasingly structuring our field organization to emphasize our domain expertise and strengthen customer relationships across target industries.\nContinue to build our international presence. We are focused on building our international presence and expanding our international revenue contribution, which accounted for 38% and 41% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are generating positive results from our recent investments in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America regions.\nLeverage our open architecture to support partners and developers. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. We integrate into third-party messaging endpoints including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, WeChat, Google Ad Lingo, Google Search, Google Maps, Instagram and Twitter, multiple IVR vendors and dozens of branded apps. The Conversational Cloud integrates our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI with third-party bot offerings, empowering our customers to manage a mix of different bots, human agents and technologies from one control panel, thereby optimizing contact center efficiency. LivePerson's proprietary and third-party AI/bots enable brands to partially or fully automate communications with their customers.\nIn addition, we have opened up access to our platform and our products with more than 40 APIs and software development kits that allow customers and third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2019, we launched LivePerson Functions, a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) integration which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within LivePerson's conversational platform to easily and rapidly tailor conversation flows to their specific needs.\nExpand sales partnerships to broaden our presence and accelerate sales cycles. We are focused on broadening our market reach and accelerating sales cycles by partnering with systems integrators, technology providers, business process outsourcers, value added resellers and other sales partners. We formalized a relationship with IBM Global Business Services in 2017 and Accenture in 2018. In 2019, we announced strategic partnerships with TTEC, a leading BPO focused on customer experience, and DMI, a digital transformation company, to redefine the customer experience with digital engagement, messaging, and AI-driven automation. In 2020, Infosys joined LivePerson's network with a first-of-its-kind 360-degree partnership focusing not only on capturing the global rising demand for conversational commerce and building a personalized experience for customers, but also driving the transformation for internal corporate messaging and the employee experience through Conversational AI. LivePerson increased the number of partners focused on SMBs to more than 300 at year-end 2020 and 2019, from over 150 at year-end 2018, and approximately 40 at the end of 2017. Approximately one quarter of all opportunities were influenced by partners in 2020, and we are focused on driving that contribution toward 50% longer term.\nMaintain market leadership in technology and security expertise. As described above, we are devoting significant resources to creating new products and enabling technologies designed to accelerate innovation. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in order to retain our leadership position in each market we serve. We monitor legal and technological developments in the area of information security and confidentiality to ensure our policies and procedures meet or exceed the demands of the world's largest and most demanding corporations. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing customer and consumer requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.\nEvaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions when appropriate. We have successfully integrated several acquisitions over the past decade. While we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, engage in discussions regarding acquisitions or strategic transactions or to acquire other companies that can accelerate our growth or broaden our product offerings, we currently have no binding commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or strategic transactions.\n.\nKey Metrics\nFinancial overview of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the comparable periods in 2019 is as follows:\n\u2022Revenue increased 29% and 26% to $102.1 million and $366.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $79.1 million and $291.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue from our Business segment increased 29% and 26% to $94.1 million and $336.9 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $72.8 million and $267.1 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Gross profit margin increased to 73% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 from 72% in the comparable period in 2019. Gross profit margin decreased to 71% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from 73% in the comparable period in 2019.\n\u2022Cost and expenses increased 5% and 20% to $108.8 million and $456.1 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $103.6 million and $378.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Net loss increased to $13.3 million and to $107.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from net loss of $27.3 million and $96.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Trailing-twelve-month average revenue per enterprise and mid-market customer was approximately $465,000 in 2020, as compared to approximately $345,000 in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue retention rate for enterprise and mid-market customers on Conversational Cloud exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% in 2020, and was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2019.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the LivePerson services. We charge a monthly fee, which varies by service and customer usage. The majority of our larger customers also pay a professional services fee related to implementation and ongoing optimization services. A large proportion of our revenue from new customers comes from large corporations. These companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards. Such customers also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements, and are likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nFor more information about our revenue recognition policies, please see -- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n-- Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nRevenue attributable to our monthly hosted Business services accounted for 78% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 77% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 79% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nRevenue attributable to professional services accounted for 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nRevenue from our Consumer segment accounted for approximately 8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance. The decrease of $0.1 million in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by satisfying our performance obligations and the revenue recognized of approximately $103.2 million that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost of revenue consists of:\n\u2022compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer support and implementation services to our customers;\n\u2022outside labor provider costs;\n\u2022compensation costs relating to our network support staff;\n\u2022depreciation of certain hardware and software;\n\u2022allocated occupancy costs and related overhead;\n\u2022the cost of supporting our infrastructure, including expenses related to server leases, infrastructure support costs and Internet connectivity;\n\u2022the credit card fees and related payment processing costs associated with the consumer and SMB services; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangibles.\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales personnel and marketing personnel, online marketing, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, advertising, sales commissions, public relations, promotional materials, travel expenses, global customer summits and trade show exhibit expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, legal, information technology and human resources personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, litigation, professional fees, provision for doubtful accounts and other general corporate expenses.\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software. Product development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\nDuring 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. During 2019, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $2.3 million to approximately $3.1 million. We perform a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers, among other factors, the aging of the accounts receivable, historical write-offs and the creditworthiness of each customer. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nNon-Cash Compensation Expense\nThe net non-cash compensation amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consist of (amounts in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nWe are organized into two operating segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Business segment enables brands to leverage the Conversational Cloud sophisticated intelligence engine to connect with consumers through an integrated suite of mobile and online business messaging technologies.

These increases were offset in part by a decrease in allocated occupancy costs, related overhead, information technology, and other general corporate expenses of approximately $1.9 million.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel as well as allocated occupancy costs and related overhead and outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headcount (at period end) </td> <td>467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct development costs increased by 32% to $108.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily related to an increase in salaries and employee related expenses of approximately $11.9 million, in business services and outsourcing subcontracted labor of approximately $8.6 million, in backup server facilities of approximately $1.1 million related to costs supporting our backup servers and in depreciation expense of approximately $5.0 million. The Company made investments in public cloud migration, and in enhancing and expanding new features of the Conversational Cloud. Also, the Company invested in bringing more data scientists and machine learning engineers to focus on Conversational Al.\nProduct development costs increased by 47% to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily related to an increase in compensation, recruitment, and related costs of approximately $15.3 million, as the Company built out its Seattle Advanced Technology Center, ending 2019 with more than 125 data scientists, machine learnings engineers and automation engineers focused on Conversational AI. The increase was also related to an increase in outsourced labor of approximately $5.0 million, primarily tied to supporting demand\nfor technical services. Facility, allocated occupancy costs and overhead related to costs of supporting our server and network infrastructure increased approximately $4.3 million, depreciation expenses increased approximately $1.5 million, and marketing related costs increased $0.3 million.\nWe continue to invest in new product development efforts to expand the capability of the Conversational Cloud. In accordance with ASC 350-40, \u2018\u2018Internal- Use Software'', as new projects are initiated that provide functionality to the Conversational Cloud platform, the associated development and employee costs will be capitalized. Upon completion, the project costs will be depreciated over five years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $33.9 million and $29.1 million was capitalized, respectively.\nRestructuring Costs\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring Costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,340 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring costs increased by 1,340% to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to an increase in restructuring costs related to lease abandonment of approximately $24.1 million, along with severance and other compensation costs of approximately $5.3 million.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company went through a re-evaluation of our real estate needs. In connection with this re-evaluation, and the success we have had working remotely, it was decided in July 2020 that we would significantly reduce the real estate space we lease. This decision resulted in the significant reduction of the real estate space we lease and the removal of the associated right of use assets (\"ROU assets\"). Furthermore, this resulted in various one-time expenses in connection with the abandonment of the majority of our leased facilities. The lease restructuring costs noted above are a result of this transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nRestructuring costs decreased by 54% to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to a decrease in severance and other associated costs of approximately $2.5 million. Severance costs are associated with re-prioritizing and reallocating resources to focus on areas showing high growth potential.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of purchased intangibles </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization expense for purchased intangibles decreased by 9% to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased by 7% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The year over year variance is primarily attributable to amortization of patents and customer relationships.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents, investment income and financial (expense) income which is a result of currency rate fluctuations associated with exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar against the New Israeli Shekel, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian dollar and the Euro.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (expense) income </td> <td>(14,334) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,768) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,343) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(211) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(493) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(346) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,677) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,194) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,194) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(471) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,215 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (expense) income increased by $9.5 million to an expense of $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u2018\u20182024 Notes''), offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nOther (expense) income increased by $5.7 million to an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 2024 Notes, offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense decreased by 13% to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2020, we recognized a benefit of $0.6 million due to net operating loss and research and development credits carryback resulting from the CARES Act. The decrease in tax expense is primarily due to these factors.\nIncome tax expense increased by 232% to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2018, we recognized a benefit of $2.0 million related to a settlement with the Israeli Tax Authority. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a benefit as the recorded liability was less than the final settlement. A benefit was also recorded for U.S. federal tax refunds that were recognized due to increased foreign tax credits and increased federal NOLs from foreign tax deductions. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to these factors.\nNet Loss\nWe had a net loss of $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue increased approximately $75.0 million, operating expenses increased by approximately $77.4 million, the provision for income taxes decreased approximately $0.4 million, and other (expense) income net increased by $9.5 million, contributing to a net increase in net loss of approximately $11.5 million.\nWe had a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue increased approximately $41.8 million, operating expenses increased by approximately $105.1 million, the provision for income taxes increased approximately $2.0 million, and other (expense) income, net decreased by approximately $5.7 million, contributing to a net increase in net loss of approximately $71.0 million.\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Company's financial information for the eight most recent quarters ended December 31, 2020.

from December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to cash provided by financing activities relating to issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the issuance of common stock. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, fixed assets for our co-location facilities, capitalization of internally developed software, debt issuance costs, and increases in prepaid expenses and accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $33.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net loss was $107.6 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in operating lease liability due to the transition to an employee centric model under which employees will work remotely, and increase in accrued expenses and decrease in accounts receivable. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and decrease in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was $59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss was $96.1 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in deferred revenue due to more of our customers moving to cash payments in advance on annual billings and in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and accounts receivable, and decrease in deferred tax liability.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities was $48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $483.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from issuance of the 2026 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and payment of our finance lease. The net proceeds of the 2026 Notes was approximately $506.6 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash provided by financing activities was $217.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and repurchase of our common stock. The net proceeds of the 2024 Notes was approximately $221.4 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2024 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds prior to such time, and we would then seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through public financings, or seek alternative sources of financing. We cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, when needed, if at all. If we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing, we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion, to develop new or enhanced services or products, or to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any special purposes entities, and other than operating leases, which are described below we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating and finance leases. These leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance. Total lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was approximately $13.5 million, $13.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal commitments were approximately $24.4 million under various operating and finance leases, of which approximately $10.2 million is due in 2021. We currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ending December 31, 2021 will not exceed approximately $10.2 million in the aggregate.\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our convertible senior notes.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal capital expenditures in 2020 were approximately $41.6 million, primarily related to software capitalization and to the continued expansion of our co-location facilities. Our total capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed $47.3 million in 2021. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures.\nIndemnifications\nWe enter into service and license agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to some of these agreements, we agree to indemnify certain customers from and against certain types of claims and losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of using our products.\nWe also have agreements whereby our executive officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Currently, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available. We base these estimates on our historical experience, future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any differences could be material. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of our services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTotal revenue of $366.6 million, $291.6 million, and $249.8 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nHosted Services Business revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration expected to be received and primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to the Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class, cloud-based platform. We have determined such access represents a stand-ready service provided continually throughout the contract term. As such, control and satisfaction of this stand-ready performance obligation is deemed to occur over time. We recognize this revenue over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that access to the Conversational Cloud platform is made available to the customer. The passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control of the services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by our performance. Subscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Additionally, for certain of our larger customers, we may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified vendors. For most of these customers, we pass the fee we incur with the labor provider and its fee for the hosted services through to our customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via our online engagement solutions. For these Gainshare (formerly Pay for Performance\u201d) arrangements in accordance with ASC-606, \u2018\u2018Principal Agent Considerations,'' we act as a principal in a transaction if we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training delivered on an on-demand basis which is deemed to represent a distinct stand-ready performance obligation. Professional Services Revenues are reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Control for the majority of our Professional Services contracts passes over time to the customer and is recognized ratably over the contracted period, as the passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control. For certain deployment services, which are not deemed to represent a distinct performance obligation, revenue will be recognized in the same manner as the fee for access to the Conversational Cloud platform, and as such will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. For services billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed using time and materials as the measure of progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Professional service contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nFor revenue from our Consumer segment generated from online transactions between Experts and Users, revenue is recognized at an amount net of Expert fees in accordance with ASC 606, Principal Agent Considerations,\u201d due primarily to the fact that we do not act as a principal in a transaction since we do not control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. Additionally, we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection, and we are not involved in selecting the Expert or establishing the Expert's fee. We collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee, and then remit the balance to the Expert. Revenue from these transactions is recognized at the point in time when the transaction is complete and no significant performance obligations remain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe follow ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation,\u201d which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $17.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $66.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition (except for customers who purchase the LivePerson services by credit card via Internet download) and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable, although they may change in the future. If there is a deterioration of a customer's credit worthiness or actual write-offs are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected. Although our large number of customers limits our concentration of credit risk, if we experience a significant write-off from one of our large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2020 and 2018. Two customers exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2019. During 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as two reporting units and has selected September 30 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nNo goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, capitalized internal-use software, costs to obtain customer contracts, and acquired intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was a loss on disposal of approximately $5.1 million in October 2020. The Company recognized accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that were determined to no longer be of future economic benefit to the Company based on the decision to vacate the leased office space.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to become deductible. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We include interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses. We recorded a valuation allowance as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $6.9 million.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Periodically, we evaluate the status of each legal matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance. As a result, the assessment of a potential liability and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the legal proceeding or litigation, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 13, Legal Matters, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our legal proceedings and litigation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently issued accounting standards.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nLivePerson, Inc. ( LivePerson\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d) makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our\ntechnology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.\nThe Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand's primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.\nLivePerson's robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nFor your reference:\n\u2022 Conversational AI: Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text.\n\u2022 Conversational Space: In the Conversational Space, consumers message with brands on their own schedule, using natural language, to resolve their intents - all on their preferred messaging service. The core capabilities\nof the Conversational Space are voice and text-based interfaces, powered by AI and humans working together. Conversational Space is the simplest, most intuitive interface of all.\n\u2022 Conversational Cloud: LivePerson's enterprise-class, AI-powered Conversational Cloud platform empowers consumers to message their favorite brands, just as they do with friends and family.\nLivePerson's Conversational AI offerings put the power of bot development, training, management and analysis into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call the tango\u201d of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.\nComplementing our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings are teams of technical, solutions and consulting professionals that have developed deep domain expertise in the implementation and optimization of conversational services across industries and messaging endpoints. We are a leading authority in the Conversational Space. LivePerson's products, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the effectiveness of the Conversational Space and deliver measurable return on investment. Certain of our customers have achieved the following advantages from our offerings:\n\u2022the ability for each agent to manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed;\n\u2022labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor costs by at least 50%;\n\u2022improving the overall customer experience, thereby fueling customer satisfaction increases of up to 20 percentage points, and enhancing retention and loyalty;\n\u2022more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations that increase sales conversion by up to 20%, increase average order value and reduce abandonment;\n\u2022more satisfied contact center agents, thereby reducing agent churn by up to 50%;\n\u2022maintain a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms;\n\u2022leverage spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions;\n\u2022refine and improve performance by understanding which initiatives deliver the highest rate of return; and\n\u2022increase lead generation by providing a single platform that engages consumers through advertisements and listings on branded and third-party websites.\nAs a cloud computing\u201d or software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.\nTo further enhance our platform, in September 2020 we signed a partnership with Infosys, a leader in next-generation\ndigital services and consulting. We will work with Infosys to transform our technology infrastructure on the public cloud, to\nbuild integrated solutions and a global practice around our Conversational Cloud to sell into their channels and global enterprise\ncustomer base, and to redefine how the world's top brands communicate.\nMore than 18,000 businesses, including HSBC, Orange, The Home Depot, and GM Financial use our conversational solutions to orchestrate humans and AI, at scale, and create a convenient, deeply personal relationship with their customers.\nLivePerson's consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers\n(Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and\nprogramming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.\nThe key elements of LivePerson's business solutions strategy include:\nBuild awareness and drive adoption of the Conversational Space. LivePerson brought our first customer live on messaging in June 2016. Since that time, we have been focused on building awareness for conversational experiences and driving adoption. We have educated businesses on the financial and operational transformation that occurs when a contact center shifts to an asynchronous messaging environment, where the consumer controls the pace of the conversation, which can last minutes, hours or days, from a synchronous call or chat center, where conversations occur in real-time and have a distinct start and end.\nA key component of our industry awareness marketing strategy has been to hold multiple global customer summits each year (events in 2020 were held virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic) that target executives from enterprise customers and prospects, and feature a key theme within the Conversational Space, such as Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, IVR deflection or AI. LivePerson customers are the centerpoint of these summits, presenting why they chose LivePerson for conversational experiences, how they achieved success, and what type of ROI they have realized. Each attendee then receives a blueprint for how they can achieve similar outcomes. We have found this strategy to drive strong results for LivePerson, as we have seen a greater than 40% conversion rate on opportunities that were created or advanced as part of the customer summits. By year-end 2020, we had brought approximately 400 customers live on messaging and increased adoption within our enterprise customers to 66%. In addition, nearly 70% of messaging conversations had automation attached. We will continue to focus on building awareness for the Conversational Space and driving adoption of messaging and AI across our customer base.\nIncrease messaging volumes by developing a broad ecosystem, expanding customer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation. Our strategy is to drive higher messaging volumes by going both wide across messaging endpoints, deep across consumer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation as the means to deliver powerful scale. LivePerson offers a platform usage pricing model, where customers are offered access to our entire suite of messaging technologies across their entire agent pool for a pre-negotiated cost per interaction. We believe that over time this model will drive higher revenue for LivePerson by reducing barriers to adoption of new messaging endpoints and use cases.\nIn order to drive broad messaging adoption, it is imperative that the Conversational Cloud integrates to all of the messaging apps that consumers prefer to use for communication and addresses all key use cases. For example, if a consumer is\nan avid WhatsApp user, and a brand only offers SMS as a messaging option, that consumer may be reluctant to try messaging the brand. Therefore, a key strategy of ours has been to build one of the industry's broadest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases. In June 2016, we launched with In-App messaging. In 2017, we introduced Facebook Messenger, SMS, Web messaging and IVR deflection integrations. In 2018, we added Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, Google Ad Lingo and Twitter. In 2019, we added email, allowing brands to manage emails through the same console they use for messaging, and to convert legacy emails into messaging conversations. We also added social monitoring and conversational tools for Twitter and Facebook, and introduced proactive messaging, allowing brands to transform traditional one-way notifications such as flight cancellations or phone plan overage alerts into two-way conversations. Finally, we connected to Facebook and WhatsApp digital advertisements, enabling consumers to initiate messaging conversations for marketing and customer care directly within the advertisement. In 2020, we added Instagram and Google's Business Messages, allowing brands to bring customer-initiated conversations into the Conversational Cloud directly from Instagram, Google Search, and Google Maps.\nEach channel and use case added opens the door to hundreds of millions of new consumers, providing brands a greater opportunity to shift share away from their legacy contact center channels into messaging. For example, in 2019, leading airlines launched on WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat with the ability to make secure payments; a baseball stadium launched an automated conversational concierge providing answers to a wide range of questions from restroom locations to player stats; and a multinational telecommunications company used proactive two-way messaging for outbound campaigns. In 2020, one of the largest telcos in Australia fully virtualized their contact centers, a leading U.S. quick-serve restaurant launched on Facebook Messenger to help customers order meals, one of the biggest banks in the world launched an Apple Business Chat channel to provide a secure way to perform day-to-day banking, and one of the world's largest jewelry retailers used the Conversational Cloud and QR codes to sell millions of dollars of product.\nLivePerson makes the management of all these disparate channels seamless to the brand. AI-based intelligent routing, queuing and prioritization software orchestrates these conversations at scale, regardless of which messaging endpoint they originated from, so that human and bot agents can engage with all customers through just one console.\nWe believe LivePerson is leading the structural shift to Conversational AI. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising and brick and mortar. Our Conversational AI leadership and the increase in adoption have influenced LivePerson's enterprise and mid-market revenue retention rate, (the trailing-twelve-month change in total revenue from existing customers after upsells, downsells and attrition) which exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% for 2020. The benefit can also be seen in LivePerson's average revenue per user (ARPU) for our enterprise and mid-market customers, which increased approximately 35% in 2020 to $465,000 from approximately $345,000 in 2019.\nAttract the industry's best AI, machine learning and conversational talent. We believe that AI and machine learning are critical to successfully scaling in the Conversational Space, and that in order to develop the industry's leading technology, we need to attract the industry's best talent. In 2018, LivePerson recruited Alex Spinelli, key architect of the Alexa Operating System at Amazon.com, as our Global CTO. Under Mr. Spinelli's leadership, LivePerson hired more than 280 of the industry's brightest data scientists, machine learning engineers and automation engineers, many from firms such as Nike, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Target, who are working exclusively on applying AI to the Conversational Space. LivePerson also expanded its development talent base in Germany, and added key development talent through the acquisitions of BotCentral in Mountain View, California and Conversable in Austin, Texas.\nBring to market best-in-class AI and machine learning technologies designed for the conversational space. We believe that in the last decade many vendors introduced AI and bot offerings that created frustrating experiences for consumers and businesses alike, which in turn has eroded trust in automation. Many of these solutions have proven difficult to build and scale, and have been limited by stand-alone implementations that lacked the measurement, reporting and human oversight of conversational platforms such as the Conversational Cloud. In December 2018, LivePerson announced its patent pending AI engine that is designed to overcome these shortcomings and help brands rapidly bring to market conversational AI that can scale to millions of interactions, while increasing customer satisfaction and conversion rates.\nUnlike alternative solutions designed solely for IT departments, LivePerson's Conversational AI was built to be used by developers and contact center agents. By putting the power of conversational design and bot management in the hands of contact center agents, LivePerson's Conversational AI gives brands the ability to leverage the employees closest to the customer, those who are most versed in the voice of the brand, and with the most expertise in how to craft successful outcomes for customer service and sales journeys.\nSome of the key innovations behind LivePerson's Conversational AI include:\n\u2022a holistic approach to scaling AI by combining consumer facing bots, agent facing bots, intelligent routing and real-time intent understanding, with an analytics dashboard that helps users focus on the intents that are impacting their business and prioritize which intents to automate next;\n\u2022bot building software that is based on dialogue instead of workflow or code, so non-technical employees like contact center agents can design automations;\n\u2022leveraging data moat from hundreds of millions of conversations to feed the machine learning that rapidly and accurately detects consumer sentiment and intents in real-time. Customers of LivePerson can use intent understanding for advanced routing, next-best actions, and to fully contain conversations with automation;\n\u2022the establishing of contact center agents as bot managers, ensuring that every conversation is safeguarded by a human and that agents are continuously training the AI to be smarter and drive more successful outcomes;\n\u2022powerful Assist technology that multiplies the efficiency of agents by analyzing intents in real time and then suggesting next best actions, predefined content, and bots that can take over transactional work;\n\u2022pre-built templates for target verticals that provide out of the box support for the top intents and back-end integrations;\n\u2022the ability to bootstrap conversations with existing transcripts, reducing design effort and speeding time to market;\n\u2022third-party AI natural language understanding (NLU) integration, so customers aren't boxed into one vendor;\n\u2022AI analytics and reporting tailored to the Conversational Space, providing brands with immediate, actionable insights about their businesses and contact center operations.\nOur strategy is to continue to enhance the Conversational AI engine and related products, by leveraging our global R&D footprint and substantial library of mobile and online conversational data, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.\nSustain our leadership position by aligning brands to a vision that transforms how they communicate with consumers and delivers a superior return on investment. We believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as a feature. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson holds the perspective that messaging and AI are the foundation for transforming conversational experiences, disrupting how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done correctly, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, emails and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nWe believe that LivePerson is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformation due to our technology and expertise:\n\u2022The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson's enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers.\n\u2022The Company has a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding.\n\u2022The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising and brick and mortar.\n\u2022LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space. We have developed a Transformation Model that is introduced to existing and prospective customers to help guide them on their journeys from legacy and often times inefficient legacy voice, email and chat solutions to modern conversational ones powered by messaging and AI.\nWe believe that LivePerson's differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise has established us as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment. LivePerson customers manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed. Our customers often see labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor\ncosts by at least 50%. Furthermore, our ability to deliver more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations often drives increases in customer satisfaction of up to 20 percentage points and increases in sales conversions of up to 20%, while\nenhancing average order value, customer retention and loyalty.\nStrengthen our position in both existing and new industries. We plan to continue to develop our market position by increasing our customer base, and expanding within our installed base. We will continue to focus primarily on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology and automotive within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the small business (SMB) sector. In 2019, we made strong inroads into new verticals with key wins in the airline, food service and healthcare industries. In 2020, we strengthened our presence in key markets including travel/hospitality and retail, and opened new verticals like healthcare and government. We are experimenting\nwith new conversational businesses, including some that are in regulated industries, like online banking. We are increasingly structuring our field organization to emphasize our domain expertise and strengthen customer relationships across target industries.\nContinue to build our international presence. We are focused on building our international presence and expanding our international revenue contribution, which accounted for 38% and 41% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are generating positive results from our recent investments in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America regions.\nLeverage our open architecture to support partners and developers. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. We integrate into third-party messaging endpoints including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, WeChat, Google Ad Lingo, Google Search, Google Maps, Instagram and Twitter, multiple IVR vendors and dozens of branded apps. The Conversational Cloud integrates our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI with third-party bot offerings, empowering our customers to manage a mix of different bots, human agents and technologies from one control panel, thereby optimizing contact center efficiency. LivePerson's proprietary and third-party AI/bots enable brands to partially or fully automate communications with their customers.\nIn addition, we have opened up access to our platform and our products with more than 40 APIs and software development kits that allow customers and third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2019, we launched LivePerson Functions, a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) integration which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within LivePerson's conversational platform to easily and rapidly tailor conversation flows to their specific needs.\nExpand sales partnerships to broaden our presence and accelerate sales cycles. We are focused on broadening our market reach and accelerating sales cycles by partnering with systems integrators, technology providers, business process outsourcers, value added resellers and other sales partners. We formalized a relationship with IBM Global Business Services in 2017 and Accenture in 2018. In 2019, we announced strategic partnerships with TTEC, a leading BPO focused on customer experience, and DMI, a digital transformation company, to redefine the customer experience with digital engagement, messaging, and AI-driven automation. In 2020, Infosys joined LivePerson's network with a first-of-its-kind 360-degree partnership focusing not only on capturing the global rising demand for conversational commerce and building a personalized experience for customers, but also driving the transformation for internal corporate messaging and the employee experience through Conversational AI. LivePerson increased the number of partners focused on SMBs to more than 300 at year-end 2020 and 2019, from over 150 at year-end 2018, and approximately 40 at the end of 2017. Approximately one quarter of all opportunities were influenced by partners in 2020, and we are focused on driving that contribution toward 50% longer term.\nMaintain market leadership in technology and security expertise. As described above, we are devoting significant resources to creating new products and enabling technologies designed to accelerate innovation. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in order to retain our leadership position in each market we serve. We monitor legal and technological developments in the area of information security and confidentiality to ensure our policies and procedures meet or exceed the demands of the world's largest and most demanding corporations. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing customer and consumer requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.\nEvaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions when appropriate. We have successfully integrated several acquisitions over the past decade. While we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, engage in discussions regarding acquisitions or strategic transactions or to acquire other companies that can accelerate our growth or broaden our product offerings, we currently have no binding commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or strategic transactions.\n.\nKey Metrics\nFinancial overview of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the comparable periods in 2019 is as follows:\n\u2022Revenue increased 29% and 26% to $102.1 million and $366.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $79.1 million and $291.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue from our Business segment increased 29% and 26% to $94.1 million and $336.9 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $72.8 million and $267.1 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Gross profit margin increased to 73% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 from 72% in the comparable period in 2019. Gross profit margin decreased to 71% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from 73% in the comparable period in 2019.\n\u2022Cost and expenses increased 5% and 20% to $108.8 million and $456.1 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $103.6 million and $378.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Net loss increased to $13.3 million and to $107.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from net loss of $27.3 million and $96.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Trailing-twelve-month average revenue per enterprise and mid-market customer was approximately $465,000 in 2020, as compared to approximately $345,000 in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue retention rate for enterprise and mid-market customers on Conversational Cloud exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% in 2020, and was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2019.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the LivePerson services. We charge a monthly fee, which varies by service and customer usage. The majority of our larger customers also pay a professional services fee related to implementation and ongoing optimization services. A large proportion of our revenue from new customers comes from large corporations. These companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards. Such customers also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements, and are likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nFor more information about our revenue recognition policies, please see -- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n-- Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nRevenue attributable to our monthly hosted Business services accounted for 78% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 77% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 79% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nRevenue attributable to professional services accounted for 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nRevenue from our Consumer segment accounted for approximately 8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance. The decrease of $0.1 million in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by satisfying our performance obligations and the revenue recognized of approximately $103.2 million that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost of revenue consists of:\n\u2022compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer support and implementation services to our customers;\n\u2022outside labor provider costs;\n\u2022compensation costs relating to our network support staff;\n\u2022depreciation of certain hardware and software;\n\u2022allocated occupancy costs and related overhead;\n\u2022the cost of supporting our infrastructure, including expenses related to server leases, infrastructure support costs and Internet connectivity;\n\u2022the credit card fees and related payment processing costs associated with the consumer and SMB services; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangibles.\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales personnel and marketing personnel, online marketing, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, advertising, sales commissions, public relations, promotional materials, travel expenses, global customer summits and trade show exhibit expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, legal, information technology and human resources personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, litigation, professional fees, provision for doubtful accounts and other general corporate expenses.\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software. Product development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\nDuring 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. During 2019, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $2.3 million to approximately $3.1 million. We perform a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers, among other factors, the aging of the accounts receivable, historical write-offs and the creditworthiness of each customer. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nNon-Cash Compensation Expense\nThe net non-cash compensation amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consist of (amounts in thousands):\n\nResults of Operations\nWe are organized into two operating segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Business segment enables brands to leverage the Conversational Cloud sophisticated intelligence engine to connect with consumers through an integrated suite of mobile and online business messaging technologies. The Consumer segment facilitates online transactions between Experts and Users seeking information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging.\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenues for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results. \nRevenue\n\nBusiness Revenue increased by 26% to $336.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $267.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in Business revenue is driven mainly by increases in hosted services of approximately $60.9 million and an increase in professional services of approximately $8.8 million. Included in hosted services, is an increase in revenue that is variable based on interactions and usage of approximately $30.1 million.\nBusiness revenue increased by 16% to $267.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $230.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in Business revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in hosted services of approximately $28.2 million and an increase in professional services of approximately $8.6 million.\nThe increase in Business revenue was driven in nearly equal parts by existing and new customers as LivePerson generated greater demand for its Conversational Commerce software and Gainshare (formerly Pay for Performance\u201d) solutions. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising, and brick and mortar. As adoption increases, we are seeing higher revenue per customer. Our average annual revenue per enterprise and midmarket customer was approximately $465,000 in 2020, as compared to approximately $345,000 in 2019. Similarly, we are seeing strong revenue retention rates. Revenue retention rate for enterprise and mid-market customers on Conversational Cloud exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% in 2020, and was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2019.\nConsumer revenue increased by 22% to $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in chat minutes and price per minute. Consumer revenue increased by 25% to $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in chat minutes and price per minute.\nCost of Revenue - Business\nCost of revenue consists of compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer service to our customers, compensation costs relating to our network support staff, the cost of supporting our server and network infrastructure, and allocated occupancy costs and related overhead.\n\nCost of revenue increased by 33% to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in expense is primarily attributable to an increase in business services and outsourced subcontracted labor of approximately $17.0 million as the Company saw a significant increase in demand for its Gainshare (formerly Pay for Performance\u201d) services, which power Conversational Commerce programs on behalf of customers. The Company also recognized an increase in salary and employee related expenses of approximately $5.0 million, in expenses for backup server facilities of approximately $1.6 million, in depreciation expense of approximately $1.2 million and in amortization expense of approximately $0.8 million.\nCost of revenue increased by 27% to $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in expense is primarily attributable to an increase in business services and outsourced subcontracted labor of approximately $7.2 million, in salary and related employee expenses of approximately $4.4 million, in expenses for backup server facilities of approximately $4.0 million and in depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million.\nCost of Revenue - Consumer\nCost of revenue consists of compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer service to Experts and Users, compensation costs relating to our network support staff, the cost of supporting our server and network infrastructure, credit card and transaction processing fees and related costs, and allocated occupancy costs and related overhead.\n\nCost of revenue increased by 56% to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in expense is primarily related to an increase in outsourcing subcontracted labor of approximately $1.3 million is due to the investment in technology infrastructure. We increased outside labor to accelerate a technology change which assisted us in the rollout of HeyExpert, a leading platform for online expert guidance. In addition, there was an increase in salary and employee related expenses of approximately $0.4 million, in credit card processing fees of approximately $0.3 million, in depreciation expense of approximately $0.3 million and backup server facilities of approximately $0.1 million.\nCost of revenue increased by 9% to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in expense is primarily related to an increase in credit card processing fees of approximately $0.3 million.\nSales and Marketing - Business\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel, as well as advertising, public relations, trade show exhibit expenses and allocated occupancy costs and related overhead.\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by 9% to $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily related to a decrease in salary and employee related expenses of approximately $7.5 million, a decrease in marketing events, advertising, public relations and trade show exhibit expenses of approximately $3.3 million, and a decrease in business services and outsourcing subcontracted labor of approximately $2.6 million. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in backup server facilities of approximately $0.7 million and in depreciation expense of approximately $0.6 million.\nIn 2020, the Company delayed its planned marketing events due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has also seen an impact in terms of the on-boarding and hiring of employees. The Company has been able to adjust its marketing and hiring efforts in this new environment going forward. Additionally, we have adapted our marketing strategy to include targeted digital experiences that emphasize the unique positioning of our messaging and AI offerings to help brands succeed in this new environment. Our marketing message has shifted to include business continuity and virtualization of the contact center in addition to business improvement.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 49% to $140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily related to an increase in salary, recruitment, and related employee expenses of approximately $29.5 million, as the Company doubled the number of quota carrying salespeople to approximately 100 at year-end 2019 from 50 at year-end 2018. Business services and outsourced labor increased approximately $6.5 million, and marketing events, advertising, public relations, and trade show exhibit expenses increased approximately $5.4 million. Other costs consisted of increases in facilities and allocated overhead of $5.1 million, and in depreciation expense of $0.1 million.\nSales and Marketing - Consumer\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for marketing personnel, as well as online promotion and trade show exhibit expenses and allocated occupancy costs and related overhead.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 32% to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in marketing expense of approximately $4.8 million, in outsourcing subcontracted labor of approximately $0.2 million, and credit card processing fees of approximately $0.1 million.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 77% to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and online expenses of approximately $6.7 million, and an increase in compensation and related costs for additional and existing sales and marketing personnel of approximately $0.2 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, legal, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, professional fees and other general corporate expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 6% to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily related to a increase in salary and employee related expenses of approximately $4.3 million and in business services and outsourced labor of approximately $2.6 million. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in facilities of approximately $2.7 million and depreciation expense of approximately $0.7 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 24% to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily related to an increase in salaries and employee related expenses of approximately $9.2 million and in business services and outsourced labor of approximately $3.8 million. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in allocated occupancy costs, related overhead, information technology, and other general corporate expenses of approximately $1.9 million.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel as well as allocated occupancy costs and related overhead and outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software.\n\nProduct development costs increased by 32% to $108.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily related to an increase in salaries and employee related expenses of approximately $11.9 million, in business services and outsourcing subcontracted labor of approximately $8.6 million, in backup server facilities of approximately $1.1 million related to costs supporting our backup servers and in depreciation expense of approximately $5.0 million. The Company made investments in public cloud migration, and in enhancing and expanding new features of the Conversational Cloud. Also, the Company invested in bringing more data scientists and machine learning engineers to focus on Conversational Al.\nProduct development costs increased by 47% to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily related to an increase in compensation, recruitment, and related costs of approximately $15.3 million, as the Company built out its Seattle Advanced Technology Center, ending 2019 with more than 125 data scientists, machine learnings engineers and automation engineers focused on Conversational AI. The increase was also related to an increase in outsourced labor of approximately $5.0 million, primarily tied to supporting demand\nfor technical services. Facility, allocated occupancy costs and overhead related to costs of supporting our server and network infrastructure increased approximately $4.3 million, depreciation expenses increased approximately $1.5 million, and marketing related costs increased $0.3 million.\nWe continue to invest in new product development efforts to expand the capability of the Conversational Cloud. In accordance with ASC 350-40, \u2018\u2018Internal- Use Software'', as new projects are initiated that provide functionality to the Conversational Cloud platform, the associated development and employee costs will be capitalized. Upon completion, the project costs will be depreciated over five years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $33.9 million and $29.1 million was capitalized, respectively.\nRestructuring Costs\n\nRestructuring costs increased by 1,340% to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to an increase in restructuring costs related to lease abandonment of approximately $24.1 million, along with severance and other compensation costs of approximately $5.3 million.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company went through a re-evaluation of our real estate needs. In connection with this re-evaluation, and the success we have had working remotely, it was decided in July 2020 that we would significantly reduce the real estate space we lease. This decision resulted in the significant reduction of the real estate space we lease and the removal of the associated right of use assets (\"ROU assets\"). Furthermore, this resulted in various one-time expenses in connection with the abandonment of the majority of our leased facilities. The lease restructuring costs noted above are a result of this transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nRestructuring costs decreased by 54% to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to a decrease in severance and other associated costs of approximately $2.5 million. Severance costs are associated with re-prioritizing and reallocating resources to focus on areas showing high growth potential.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\n\nAmortization expense for purchased intangibles decreased by 9% to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased by 7% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The year over year variance is primarily attributable to amortization of patents and customer relationships.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents, investment income and financial (expense) income which is a result of currency rate fluctuations associated with exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar against the New Israeli Shekel, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian dollar and the Euro.\n\nOther (expense) income increased by $9.5 million to an expense of $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u2018\u20182024 Notes''), offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nOther (expense) income increased by $5.7 million to an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 2024 Notes, offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense decreased by 13% to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2020, we recognized a benefit of $0.6 million due to net operating loss and research and development credits carryback resulting from the CARES Act. The decrease in tax expense is primarily due to these factors.\nIncome tax expense increased by 232% to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2018, we recognized a benefit of $2.0 million related to a settlement with the Israeli Tax Authority. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a benefit as the recorded liability was less than the final settlement. A benefit was also recorded for U.S. federal tax refunds that were recognized due to increased foreign tax credits and increased federal NOLs from foreign tax deductions. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to these factors.\nNet Loss\nWe had a net loss of $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue increased approximately $75.0 million, operating expenses increased by approximately $77.4 million, the provision for income taxes decreased approximately $0.4 million, and other (expense) income net increased by $9.5 million, contributing to a net increase in net loss of approximately $11.5 million.\nWe had a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue increased approximately $41.8 million, operating expenses increased by approximately $105.1 million, the provision for income taxes increased approximately $2.0 million, and other (expense) income, net decreased by approximately $5.7 million, contributing to a net increase in net loss of approximately $71.0 million.\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Company's financial information for the eight most recent quarters ended December 31, 2020. In the Company's opinion, this unaudited information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the annual consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited information for the periods presented. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included herein.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $654.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of approximately $477.6 million from December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to cash provided by financing activities relating to issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the issuance of common stock. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, fixed assets for our co-location facilities, capitalization of internally developed software, debt issuance costs, and increases in prepaid expenses and accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $33.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net loss was $107.6 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in operating lease liability due to the transition to an employee centric model under which employees will work remotely, and increase in accrued expenses and decrease in accounts receivable. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and decrease in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was $59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss was $96.1 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in deferred revenue due to more of our customers moving to cash payments in advance on annual billings and in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and accounts receivable, and decrease in deferred tax liability.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities was $48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $483.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from issuance of the 2026 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and payment of our finance lease. The net proceeds of the 2026 Notes was approximately $506.6 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash provided by financing activities was $217.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and repurchase of our common stock. The net proceeds of the 2024 Notes was approximately $221.4 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2024 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds prior to such time, and we would then seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through public financings, or seek alternative sources of financing. We cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, when needed, if at all. If we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing, we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion, to develop new or enhanced services or products, or to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any special purposes entities, and other than operating leases, which are described below we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating and finance leases. These leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance. Total lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was approximately $13.5 million, $13.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal commitments were approximately $24.4 million under various operating and finance leases, of which approximately $10.2 million is due in 2021. We currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ending December 31, 2021 will not exceed approximately $10.2 million in the aggregate.\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\n(1) See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our convertible senior notes.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal capital expenditures in 2020 were approximately $41.6 million, primarily related to software capitalization and to the continued expansion of our co-location facilities. Our total capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed $47.3 million in 2021. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures.\nIndemnifications\nWe enter into service and license agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to some of these agreements, we agree to indemnify certain customers from and against certain types of claims and losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of using our products.\nWe also have agreements whereby our executive officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Currently, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available. We base these estimates on our historical experience, future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any differences could be material. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of our services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTotal revenue of $366.6 million, $291.6 million, and $249.8 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nHosted Services Business revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration expected to be received and primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to the Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class, cloud-based platform. We have determined such access represents a stand-ready service provided continually throughout the contract term. As such, control and satisfaction of this stand-ready performance obligation is deemed to occur over time. We recognize this revenue over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that access to the Conversational Cloud platform is made available to the customer. The passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control of the services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by our performance. Subscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Additionally, for certain of our larger customers, we may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified vendors. For most of these customers, we pass the fee we incur with the labor provider and its fee for the hosted services through to our customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via our online engagement solutions. For these Gainshare (formerly Pay for Performance\u201d) arrangements in accordance with ASC-606, \u2018\u2018Principal Agent Considerations,'' we act as a principal in a transaction if we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training delivered on an on-demand basis which is deemed to represent a distinct stand-ready performance obligation. Professional Services Revenues are reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Control for the majority of our Professional Services contracts passes over time to the customer and is recognized ratably over the contracted period, as the passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control. For certain deployment services, which are not deemed to represent a distinct performance obligation, revenue will be recognized in the same manner as the fee for access to the Conversational Cloud platform, and as such will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. For services billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed using time and materials as the measure of progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Professional service contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nFor revenue from our Consumer segment generated from online transactions between Experts and Users, revenue is recognized at an amount net of Expert fees in accordance with ASC 606, Principal Agent Considerations,\u201d due primarily to the fact that we do not act as a principal in a transaction since we do not control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. Additionally, we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection, and we are not involved in selecting the Expert or establishing the Expert's fee. We collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee, and then remit the balance to the Expert. Revenue from these transactions is recognized at the point in time when the transaction is complete and no significant performance obligations remain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe follow ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation,\u201d which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $17.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $66.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition (except for customers who purchase the LivePerson services by credit card via Internet download) and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable, although they may change in the future. If there is a deterioration of a customer's credit worthiness or actual write-offs are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected. Although our large number of customers limits our concentration of credit risk, if we experience a significant write-off from one of our large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2020 and 2018. Two customers exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2019. During 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as two reporting units and has selected September 30 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nNo goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, capitalized internal-use software, costs to obtain customer contracts, and acquired intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was a loss on disposal of approximately $5.1 million in October 2020. The Company recognized accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that were determined to no longer be of future economic benefit to the Company based on the decision to vacate the leased office space.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to become deductible. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We include interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses. We recorded a valuation allowance as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $6.9 million.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Periodically, we evaluate the status of each legal matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance. As a result, the assessment of a potential liability and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the legal proceeding or litigation, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 13, Legal Matters, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our legal proceedings and litigation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently issued accounting standards.\nRecently Adopted
