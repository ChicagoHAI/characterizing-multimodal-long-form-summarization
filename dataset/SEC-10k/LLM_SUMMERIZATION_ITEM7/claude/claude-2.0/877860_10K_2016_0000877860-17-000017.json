MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of National Health Investors, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nExecutive Overview\nNational Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ( RIDEA\u201d) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We fund our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.\nPortfolio\nAt December 31, 2016, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 205 facilities located in 32 states. These investments involve 129 senior housing properties, 71 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $1,175,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,471,679,000, rented under triple-net leases to 27 lessees, and $133,493,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 11 borrowers.\nWe classify the properties in our portfolio as either senior housing or medical properties. We further classify our senior housing properties as either need-driven (assisted living facilities and senior living campuses) or discretionary (independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). Medical properties within our portfolio include skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\nThe following tables summarize our investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Properties\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds/Sq.

At December 31, 2016, such investments had a carrying value of $11,745,000.\nAreas of Focus\nWe are evaluating and will potentially make additional investments during the remainder of 2017 while we continue to monitor and improve our existing properties. We seek tenants who will become mission-oriented partners in relationships where our business goals are aligned. This approach fuels steady, and thus, enduring growth for those partners and for NHI. Within the context of our growth model, we rely on a cost-effective access to debt and equity capital to finance acquisitions that will drive our earnings. There is significant competition for healthcare assets from other REITs, both public and private, and from private equity sources. Large-scale portfolios continue to command premium pricing, due to the continued abundance of private and foreign buyers seeking to invest in healthcare real estate. This combination of circumstances places a premium on our ability to execute acquisitions and negotiate leases that will generate meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We emphasize growth with our existing tenants and borrowers as a way to insulate us from other competition.\nWith lower capitalization rates for existing healthcare facilities, there has been increased interest in constructing new facilities in hopes of generating better returns on invested capital. Using our relationship-driven model, we continue to look for opportunities to support new and existing tenants and borrowers with the capital needed to expand existing facilities and to initiate ground-up development of new facilities. We concentrate our efforts in those markets where there is both a demonstrated demand for a particular product type and where we perceive we have a competitive advantage. The projects we agree to finance have attractive upside potential and are expected to provide above-average returns to our shareholders to mitigate the risks inherent with property development and construction.\nOn December 16, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve announced an increase in its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The anticipation of this second increase in the federal funds rate in the past year has been a primary source of much volatility in REIT equity markets. The Committee also guided expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. As a result, there will be pressure on the spread between our cost of capital and the returns we earn. We expect that pressure to be partially mitigated by market forces that would tend to result in higher capitalization rates for healthcare assets and higher lease rates indicative of historical levels. Our cost of capital has increased over the past year as we transition some of our short term revolving borrowings into debt instruments with longer maturities and fixed interest rates. Managing long-term risk involves trade-offs with the competing alternative goal of maximizing short-term profitability. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing interests within the context of our investor profile. Due to more favorable pricing, we presently prefer private placement debt over a public offering of bond debt. As interest rates rise, our share price may decline as investors adjust prices to reflect a dividend yield that is sufficiently in excess of a risk free rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes and in recent years have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures. Over the past five years, we have selectively diversified our portfolio by directing a significant portion of our investments into properties which do not rely primarily on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, but rather on private pay sources (assisted living and memory care facilities, senior living campuses, independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). We will occasionally acquire skilled nursing facilities in good physical condition with a proven operator and strong local market fundamentals, because diversification implies a periodic rebalancing, but our recent investment focus has been on acquiring need-driven and discretionary senior housing assets.\nConsidering individual tenant lease revenue as a percentage of total revenue, Bickford Senior Living is our largest assisted living tenant, an affiliate of Holiday Retirement is our largest independent living tenant, National HealthCare Corporation is our largest skilled nursing tenant and Senior Living Communities is our largest entrance-fee community tenant. Our shift toward private payor facilities, as well as our expansion into the discretionary senior housing market, has further resulted in a portfolio whose current composition is relatively balanced between medical facilities, need-driven and discretionary senior housing.\nWe manage our business with a goal of increasing the regular annual dividends paid to shareholders. Our Board of Directors approves a regular quarterly dividend which is reflective of expected taxable income on a recurring basis. Our transactions that are infrequent and non-recurring that generate additional taxable income have been distributed to shareholders in the form of special dividends. Taxable income is determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and differs from net income for financial statements purposes determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our goal of increasing annual dividends requires a careful balance between identification of high-quality lease and mortgage assets in which to invest and the cost of our capital with which to fund such investments. We consider the competing interests of short and long-term debt (interest rates, maturities and other terms) versus the higher cost of new equity. We accept some level of risk associated with leveraging our investments. We intend to continue to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders.\nOur dividends for the current year and the last two years are as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investments in healthcare real estate have been partially accomplished by our ability to effectively leverage our balance sheet. However, we continue to maintain a relatively low-leverage balance sheet compared with many in our peer group. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions) to fixed charges (interest expense at contractual rates net of capitalized interest and principal payments on debt), and the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of our ability to service our debt. We use these two measures as a useful basis to compare the strength of our balance sheet with those in our peer group. We also believe this gives us a competitive advantage when accessing debt markets.\nWe calculate our fixed charge coverage ratio as approximately 5.8x for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to our net income on page 47). Giving effect to our acquisitions and financings on an annualized basis, our consolidated net debt-to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.4x for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(4,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,111,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized impact of recent investments\n</td> <td>17,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to current projections by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the number of Americans 65 and older is expected to grow 36% between 2010 and 2020, compared to a 9% growth rate for the general population. As Transgenerationalaging.org notes: The fastest growing segment of the total population is the oldest old - those 80 and over. Their growth rate is twice that of those 65 and over and almost 4 times that for the total population. In the United States, this group now represents 10% of the older population and will more than triple from 5.7 million in 2010 to over 19 million by 2050.\u201d\nWhile affordability issues will play a limiting role in the movement of this oldest age demographic into active participation in the senior care market, the swelling in the ranks of the very old is expected to increase demand for senior housing properties of all types in the coming decades. There is increasing demand for private-pay senior housing properties in countries outside the U.S. as well. We therefore consider real estate and note investments with U.S. entities who seek to expand their senior housing operations into countries where local-market demand is sufficiently demonstrated.\nStrong demographic trends provide the context for continued growth in 2017 and the years ahead. We plan to fund any new real estate and mortgage investments during 2017 using our liquid assets and debt financing. Should the weight of additional debt as a result of new acquisitions suggest the need to rebalance our capital structure, we would then expect to access the capital\nmarkets through an ATM or other equity offerings. Our disciplined investment strategy implemented through measured increments of debt and equity sets the stage for annual dividend growth, continued low leverage, a portfolio of diversified, high-quality assets, and business relationships with experienced operators who we make our priority, continue to be the key drivers of our business plan.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nWe consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur significant accounting policies and the associated estimates, judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows:\nValuations and Impairments\nOur tenants and borrowers who operate SNFs derive their revenues primarily from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints. From time to time, there may be material changes in government reimbursement. In the past, SNFs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement.\nThe long-term health care industry has experienced significant professional liability claims which has resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance to cover potential claims. In previous years, these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers. In prior years, we have determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as a result of these events.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property-by-property basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment charge is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property.\nFor our mortgage and other notes receivable, we evaluate the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on an instrument-by-instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.\nWe evaluate our marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairments. An impairment of a marketable security would be considered other-than-temporary\u201d unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to (or beyond) the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time.\nThe initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to our acquisition of interests in the entity. An aggregate basis difference between the cost\nof our equity method investee and the amount of underlying equity in its net assets is primarily attributable to goodwill, which is not amortized. We evaluate for impairment our equity method investments and related goodwill based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the investments to their carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other than temporary, an impairment is recorded. No impairments to the carrying value of our equity method investee have been recorded for any period presented.\nThe determination of the fair value and whether a shortfall in operating revenues or the existence of operating losses is indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, the duration of the fair value deficiency, and any other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nWhile we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable, marketable securities and other investments are realizable, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe collect rent and interest from our tenants and borrowers. Generally, our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned. However, when we determine, based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, that rent or interest is not probable of collection until received, our policy is to recognize rental or interest income when assured, which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected. We identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. This policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period. As of December 31, 2016, we have one lease, a 126-unit portfolio, for which we recognize rent income when received. The tenant was current on its lease obligations at December 31, 2016, but we continue to classify as non-performing per policy. Revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible. Lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property, such as an increase in annual revenues over base year revenues, are considered to be contingent rentals, are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned.\nREIT Qualification\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. We believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to so qualify at all times. We record income tax expense or benefit with respect to our subsidiary which is taxed as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS\u201d) under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations. Aside from such income taxes that may be applicable to the taxable income in our TRS, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation\u201d (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that typically applies to corporate dividends. Our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable REIT qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate a legal entity deemed to be a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) when we determine that we are the VIE's primary beneficiary. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance for our arrangements with VIEs which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected\nresidual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We may change our assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.\nReal Estate Properties\nReal property we develop is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of interest during construction. The cost of real property investments we acquire is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land, equipment, buildings and other improvements, and intangible assets, if any. Our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term.\nSignificant Operators\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have four lessees (including their affiliated entities, which are the legal tenants) from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our rental income as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Renewal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holiday Retirement\n</td> <td>ILF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2031\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Living Communities\n</td> <td>EFC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2029\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National HealthCare Corporation\n</td> <td>SNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>ALF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All others\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,471,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to a combination of longer initial lease terms and generous escalators, straight line rent constituted a significant component of rental income recognized from the Holiday and Senior Living leases, whose communities we acquired in December 2013 and 2014, respectively. Straight-line rent of $8,965,000 and $10,466,000 was recognized from the Holiday lease for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Straight-line rent of $7,369,000 and $8,422,000 was recognized from the Senior Living lease for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Straight-line rent of $858,000 and $267,000 was recognized from the Bickford leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For NHC, rent escalations are based on a percentage increase in revenue over a base year and do not give rise to non-cash, straight-line rental income.\nRIDEA\nOn September 30, 2016, NHI and Sycamore Street, LLC ( Sycamore\u201d), an affiliate of Bickford Senior Living ( Bickford\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement terminating our joint venture consisting of the ownership and operation of 35 properties and converting Bickford's participation to a triple-net tenancy with assumption of existing leases and terms. Through September 30, 2016, NHI owned an 85% equity interest and Sycamore owned a 15% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary ( PropCo\u201d) which owned 35 assisted living/memory care facilities, three new facilities and two facilities in development. The facilities have been leased to an operating company ( OpCo\u201d), in which NHI previously held a non-controlling 85% ownership interest. The facilities are managed by Bickford. The joint venture was structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA.\nThe September 30, 2016 agreement provided for NHI's redemption of Bickford's 15% interest in the real estate underlying the joint venture (PropCo) for a distribution to Bickford of $25,100,000, before the offset by Bickford of $8,100,000 payable to NHI in acquisition of our non-controlling 85% interest in senior housing operations (OpCo), which NHI had carried on its balance sheet as an equity-method investment through September 30, 2016. The remaining distribution of $10,546,000 related to the transaction was settled, along with the final operational accounting, in November 2016.\nNHI's gain of $1,657,000 from the sale of OpCo was calculated on the difference between the proceeds of $8,100,000 and the carrying amount of our equity-method investment of $6,443,000. No gain or loss was recognized on our acquisition of Bickford's 15% interest in PropCo, which had previously been consolidated. Rather, Bickford's non-controlling interest was de-recognized, and the difference between the fair value of NHI's cost allocated to the redemption and the carrying amount for Bickford's non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity through capital in excess of par. See Investment Highlights below for a discussion of new investments with Bickford during 2016.\nProvisions governing details of the unwinding reach to our various arrangements with Bickford and include but are not limited to the following:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the 32 stabilized facilities previously owned by the joint venture, forward annual contractual rent is unchanged at $26,454,000 plus annual escalators of 3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the five additional facilities under development owned by NHI, of which one opened in July 2016, two opened in October 2016, and two are planned to open in the first half of 2017, funded amounts will be added to the lease basis during construction and up to the first six months after opening; thereafter, base rent will be charged to Bickford at a 9% annual rate.

The facility was added to our existing master lease with Senior Living at the existing lease rate of 6.77%, subject to 4% escalation in January 2017 and 2018 and 3% annually thereafter with an initial term of 13 years, plus renewal options. Because Evergreen Woods was previously owner-operated, we accounted for our purchase of the property as an asset acquisition. As part of this transaction, we allocated $7,724,000 of the purchase price to the relative fair value of the land and $62,568,000 to the relative fair value of building and improvements.\nIn March 2016, we extended mezzanine loans of $12,000,000 and $2,000,000 to affiliates of Senior Living to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in North Carolina. The loans, which are payable monthly, bear interest at 10% per annum and mature in March 2021. The loans, having a total balance of $10,778,000 at December 31, 2016, are in addition to the $15,000,000 revolving line of credit we provided Senior Living in connection with our 2014 lease of 8 retirement communities.\nChancellor\nOn August 31, 2016, we acquired two facilities consisting of a senior living campus and a memory-care facility in McMinnville, Oregon, for $36,650,000 in cash inclusive of closing costs of $150,000. We leased the facilities to Chancellor Health Care for an initial lease term of 15 years, with renewal options, at an initial annual lease rate of 7.5% plus annual escalators. Because the facilities were owner-occupied, the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nSenior Living Management\nOn August 3, 2016, we entered into an agreement to furnish through its corporate entity and affiliates our current tenant, Senior Living Management ( SLM\u201d), Inc., with loans of up to $24,500,000 to facilitate SLM's acquisition of five senior housing facilities that it currently operates. The loans consist of two notes under a master credit agreement, include both a mortgage and a corporate loan, and bear interest at 8.25% with terms of five years, plus optional one and two-year extensions. NHI has a right of first refusal if SLM elects to sell one or more of the facilities. A total of $12,556,000 had been drawn on the two loans as of December 31, 2016. On January 17, 2017, the remaining amount under the loans was drawn.\nBickford\nOn July 15, 2016, NHI extended a $14,000,000 construction loan facility to Bickford for the purpose of developing and operating an assisted living/memory care community in Illinois. The total amount funded as of December 31, 2016 was $2,413,000, interest is to accrue at 9%, and the loan is to mature on July 15, 2021. The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage lien on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreement, including the borrower's obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. The loan and subject property were not included in the joint venture between the parties.\nOn June 1, 2016, in an asset acquisition, we acquired five assisted living and memory care facilities owned and operated by Bickford for $87,500,000, including $77,747,000 in cash and cancellation of notes and accrued interest receivable totaling $9,753,000. Additionally, we have committed $2,400,000 for capital improvements and expansion of the existing facilities, the funding of which will be added to the lease base. The lease provides for an initial rate of 7.25% and term of 15 years plus two five-year renewal options. The annual lease escalator is 3%. NHI's purchase option on an additional Bickford facility was relinquished. The facilities, consisting of 277 total units, are located in Iowa (2), Missouri, Illinois, and Nebraska. The facilities were not included in the RIDEA joint venture between the parties.\nWatermark Retirement / East Lake Capital\nOn June 1, 2016, NHI acquired two entrance fee continuing care retirement communities ( CCRCs\u201d) from funds managed by certain affiliates of East Lake Capital Management ( East Lake\u201d) for $56,300,000 in cash, inclusive of a $4,500,000 regulatory deposit, and entered into a lease transaction with affiliates of East Lake. NHI has committed up to an additional $10,000,000 for capital improvements and potential expansion of the communities over the next two years, of which $3,450,000 was drawn at December 31, 2016. The CCRCs consist of 460 units and are located in Bridgeport and Southbury, Connecticut. The communities are sub-leased to affiliates of Watermark Retirement Communities ( Watermark\u201d), the current manager. The lease has a term of 15 years, with an initial lease rate to East Lake of 7% on our total investment with escalators of 3.5% in years two through four, and 3% annually thereafter.\nIn conjunction with the lease, East Lake acquired a purchase option on the properties as a whole, exercisable beginning in year six of the lease. The option will be based on our initial acquisition cost, our funding of capital improvements and expansions, other additional funding that may then be in place, or further rent escalations during the remaining duration of the option window.\nEnsign Group\nOn April 1, 2016, we purchased eight skilled nursing facilities totaling 931 beds in Texas for $118,500,000 in cash. The facilities were owned and operated by NHI's existing tenant, Legend Healthcare ( Legend\u201d), and we accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition. Concurrent with the acquisition, we amended in-place leases covering the nine other skilled nursing facilities we leased to Legend, extending their provisions to the new facilities. The amendment also replaced purchase options that provided for equal sharing of any appreciation in value, within a specified range, with purchase options having a price determined at fair value, exercisable at the end of the lease term. Based on our analysis of the in-place rights, benefits and obligations, approximately $6,400,000 of the consideration in the acquisition from Legend was allocated to canceled provisions related to the in-place leases.\nLegend elected to transition its skilled nursing operations to a new operator on May 1, 2016, and NHI entered into a new 15-year master lease with affiliates of The Ensign Group, Inc. ( Ensign\u201d NASDAQ: ENSG) on 15 of the former Legend facilities for an initial annual amount of $17,750,000, plus an annual escalator based on inflation. NHI's total original investment in the 15 facilities leased to Ensign is approximately $211,000,000. The lease has two 5-year renewal options. Upon entering the new lease, NHI agreed to sell two existing skilled nursing facilities previously under lease to Legend in Texas totaling 245 beds to Ensign for $24,600,000. The Ensign lease, secured in part by the operator's corporate guaranty, replaces the amended Legend lease, and, accordingly, the rights, benefits and obligations held by Legend have terminated.\nAs part of this transaction, NHI is committed to purchase, from a developer, four new skilled nursing facilities in Texas for $56,000,000 which are leased to Legend and subleased to Ensign. The purchase window for the first facility is open through February 2017. The other three facilities are under construction by the developer.\nMarathon/Village Concepts\nOn January 15, 2016, we acquired a 98-unit independent living community in Chehalis, Washington, for $9,463,000 in cash inclusive of closing costs of $213,000 plus an additional commitment to fund $350,000 in specified capital improvements. We leased the facility to a partnership between Marathon Development and Village Concepts Retirement Communities for an initial lease term of 15 years. The lease provides for an initial annual lease rate of 7.25% plus annual escalators. Because the facility was owner-occupied, the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nReal Estate and Mortgage Write-downs\nOur borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to other health care providers. Governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower, or at least slow, the growth in payments to health care providers. Furthermore, the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly during this same period. Since inception, a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have undergone bankruptcy. Others have\nbeen forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or, for certain periods, have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us.\nWe believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral. However, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts. In recording the transition of our leases from Legend to Ensign in May 2016, we wrote off the $6,400,000 fair value assigned to the former Legend leases and $8,326,000 of accumulated straight-line rent receivable. Another $1,131,000 of accumulated straight-line receivables were written off in the preparation for transition to a new tenant in in the 126-unit portfolio mentioned under Other Portfolio Activity\u201d below.\nThe above write-offs have been classified among operating expenses as Loan and realty losses (recoveries)\u201d in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The losses are non-cash, transactional in nature, and relate to accounting conventions governing the recording of leases when a new lessee replaces a former lessee. Because these items may create some difficulty in comparing the current period to similar prior periods, we have adjusted their effect in our presentation of normalized non-GAAP financial measures.\nPotential Effects of Medicare Reimbursement\nOur tenants who operate SNFs receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare (federal) and Medicaid (states). Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to skilled nursing facilities could have a material impact on the operators' liquidity and financial condition. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) released a rule outlining a 1.6% increase in their Medicare reimbursement for fiscal year 2017 beginning on October 1, 2016. We currently estimate that our borrowers and lessees will be able to withstand this nominal Medicare increase due to their credit quality, profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios, although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect that similar Medicare increases on an annual basis would have on each of our borrowers and lessees. According to industry studies, state Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation. Federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to SNFs. Any near-term acquisitions of skilled nursing facilities are planned on a selective basis, with emphasis on operator quality and newer construction.\nOther Portfolio Activity\nOur leases are typically structured as triple net leases\u201d on single-tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. As such, there may be reporting periods in which we experience few, if any, lease renewals or expirations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not have any renewing or expiring leases.\nIn October 2016, as a result of material noncompliance with lease terms, we began exploratory measures to effect either transitioning the lease of a 126-unit assisted living portfolio from the current tenant or the marketing of the underlying properties. Either of these courses of action result in recording a reserve, for accounting purposes, at December 31, 2016, of $1,131,000 related to straight-line rent receivables and cessation of straight-line rent recognition. While straight-line receivables represent the effects of recognizing past and future escalations under terms of the lease using the straight-line method, we anticipate full recovery of all amounts billed to date under the lease. We have made no provision for any legal or other costs associated with the transition, as these amounts are neither estimable nor, in the opinion of management, material to our financial position or results of operations. Of our total revenues, $2,411,000, $2,497,000 and $2,604,000 were recognized as rental income from the portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn January 2016 we received full payment from an affiliate of our current lessee, Discovery Senior Living, on a $2,500,000 second mortgage loan we originally provided in October 2013 for the construction of a senior housing community in Naples, Florida. In November 2016 two mortgage loans on SNF properties in Virginia, carrying a total balance of $4,685,000, were paid in full.\nMost of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income with fixed contractual escalations is ordinarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in 2017, we are engaged in preliminary negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity. A summary of these tenant options to purchase senior housing communities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities is presented below:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>Lease\n</td> <td>1st Option\n</td> <td>Current\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type\n</td> <td>Facilities\n</td> <td>Expiration\n</td> <td>Open Year\n</td> <td>Cash Rent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MOB\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>February 2018\n</td> <td>Open\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>704,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>September 2027\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,248,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>December 2024\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,984,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>March 2025\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,778,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>June 2025\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,775,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>May 2031\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,004,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>June 2022\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,358,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Various\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,016,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation.\nTimber Ridge\nIn February 2015, we entered into an agreement to lend up to $154,500,000 to LCS-Westminster Partnership III LLP ( LCS-WP\u201d), an affiliate of Life Care Services ( LCS\u201d) . The loan agreement conveys a mortgage interest and will facilitate the construction of Phase II of Timber Ridge at Talus ( Timber Ridge\u201d), a Type-A Continuing Care Retirement Community in Issaquah, WA managed by LCS.\nThe loan takes the form of two notes under a master credit agreement. The senior note ( Note A\u201d) totals $60,000,000 at a 6.75% interest rate with 10 basis-point escalators after year three, and has a term of 10 years. We have funded $42,944,000 of Note A as of December 31, 2016. Note A is interest-only and is locked to prepayment for three years. After year three, the prepayment penalty starts at 5% and declines 1% per year. The second note ( Note B\u201d) is a construction loan for up to $94,500,000 at an annual interest rate of 8% and a five-year maturity and was fully funded as of December 31, 2016. We expect substantial repayment with new resident entrance fees from the opening of Phase II in October, 2016. Repayment of Note B amounted to $61,289,000 as of December 31, 2016, plus an additional $7,304,000 through February 15, 2017.\nNHI has a purchase option on the entire Timber Ridge property for the greater of fair market value or $115,000,000 during a purchase option window of 120 days that will contingently open in year five or upon earlier stabilization of the development, as defined. The current basis of our investment in Timber Ridge loans, net of unamortized commitment fees, is $75,112,000, but we are obligated to complete the funding of Note A up to $60,000,000.\nResults of

These capital sources were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders which increased $13,646,000 over the same period in 2015 due to a 5.9% increase in our per share dividend and the issuance of additional common shares during 2016.\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2016, our liquidity was strong, with $396,832,000 available in cash and borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nOur ATM program, discussed below, and our investment in marketable securities, carried at fair value of approximately $11,745,000 at December 31, 2016, represent additional sources of liquidity. Traditionally, debt financing and cash resulting from operating and financing activities, which are derived from proceeds of lease and mortgage collections, loan payoffs and the recovery of previous write-downs, have been used to satisfy our operational and investing needs and to provide a return to our shareholders. Those operational and investing needs reflect the resources necessary to maintain and cultivate our funding sources and have generally fallen into three categories: debt service, REIT operating expenses, and new real estate investments.\nIn June 2015, we entered into an amended $800,000,000 senior unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. The facility can be expanded, subject to certain conditions, up to an additional $250,000,000. The amended credit facility provides for: (1) a $550,000,000 revolving credit facility that matures in June 2020 (inclusive of an embedded 1-year extension option) with interest at 150 basis points over 30-day LIBOR (77 bps at December 31, 2016); (2) an existing $130,000,000 term loan that matures in June 2020 with interest at 175 basis points over LIBOR of which interest of 3.91% is fixed with an interest rate swap agreement; and (3) two existing term loans which also remain in place totaling $120,000,000, maturing in June 2020 and bearing interest at 175 basis points over LIBOR,with a notional amount of $40,000,000 being fixed at 3.29% until 2019 and $80,000,000 being fixed at 3.86% until 2020.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $392,000,000 available to draw on the revolving portion of the credit facility. The unused commitment fee is 40 basis points per annum. The unsecured credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios within limits set by our creditors. To date, these ratios, which are calculated quarterly, have been within the limits required by the credit facility agreements.\nWe began liquidating our position in LTC Properties, Inc. ( LTC\u201d) common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, we sold 1,043,800 shares in a further reduction of our LTC holdings, realizing net proceeds of $49,022,000 from these sales. In addition, we realized $17,048,000 in proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities held at amortized cost. A taxable gain of approximately $29,673,000 resulting therefrom is expected to be adequately offset by depreciation and other deductions in the calculation of our REIT taxable income, making all of the proceeds available for deployment. We held 250,000 shares of LTC common shares as of December 31, 2016.\nIn June 2016, we completed an at-the market ( ATM\u201d) equity offering. With a weighted average price for shares sold of $71.30, we issued 714,666 common shares resulting in net proceeds of $50,189,000, which we used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We sold additional shares under our ATM program beginning in August 2016 to provide ratable equity funding for our third quarter investments and in anticipation of our Evergreen acquisition announced November 3, 2016. We obtained an weighted average price for shares sold of $80.51, in issuing 680,976 common shares, resulting in net proceeds of $54,001,000.\nThe use of funds from our ATM and the sales of LTC common stock effected a rebalancing of our leverage in response to our year-to-date acquisitions and keeps our options flexible for further expansion. We continue to explore various other funding sources including bank term loans, convertible debt, traditional equity placement, unsecured bonds and senior notes, debt private placement and secured government agency financing. We view our ATM program as an effective way to match-fund our smaller acquisitions by exercising control over the timing and size of transactions and achieving a more favorable cost of capital as compared to larger follow-on offerings.\nWe expect that borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on term loans, liquidation of our marketable securities and our ATM program will allow us to continue to make real estate investments during 2017.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit facility. The ATM offerings have been made pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated February 17, 2015 and a related prospectus dated March 18, 2014, which constitute a part of NHI's effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect to file a new registration statement and commence a new ATM program in first quarter 2017.\nTo mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk, we have entered into the following interest rate swap contracts on three of our term loans as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Date Entered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.86%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,612\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d), and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, which is reported in current period earnings as interest expense, was not significant for the three years ended December 31, 2016.\nWe periodically refinance the borrowings on our revolving credit facility through the ATM and longer-term debt instruments. We consider secured debt from U.S. Govt. agencies, including HUD, private placements of unsecured debt, and public offerings of debt and equity. We anticipate that our historically low cost of debt capital will rise in the near to mid-term, as the federal government continues its upward transitioning of the Federal funds rate.\nIf we modify or replace existing debt, we would incur debt issuance costs. These fees would be subject to amortization over the term of the new debt instrument and may result in the write-off of fees associated with debt which has been replaced or modified. Sustaining long-term dividend growth will require that we consider all forms of capital mentioned above, with the goal of maintaining a low-leverage balance sheet as mitigation against potential adverse changes in the business of our tenants and borrowers.\nWe intend to comply with REIT dividend requirements that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2016 and thereafter. Dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following January and are, with some exceptions, treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended\nas provided in IRS Code Sec. 857(b)(8). We declare special dividends when we compute our REIT taxable income in an amount that exceeds our regular dividends for the fiscal year.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no outstanding guarantees. For additional information on our letter of credit with Sycamore, an affiliate of Bickford, see our discussion in this section under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities below. Our loans to LCS-WP and our lease with East Lake represent variable interests in those enterprises. However, because we do not control these entities, nor do we have any role in their day-to-day management, we are not their primary beneficiary. Except as discussed below under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities, we have no further material obligations arising from our transactions with these entities, and we believe our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2016, due to this involvement would be limited to our contractual commitments and contingent liabilities and the amount of our current investments with them, as detailed further in Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2014 we issued $200,000,000 of convertible bonds, the conversion feature being intended to broaden the Company's credit profile and as a means to obtain a more favorable coupon rate. For this feature we calculate the dilutive effect using market prices prevailing over the reporting period. Because the dilution calculation is market-driven, and per share guidance we provide is based on diluted amounts, the theoretical effects of the conversion feature result in per share unpredictability.\nAdditional disclosure requirements also give widely ranging results depending on market price variability. The bonds will be freely convertible in the last six months of their contractual life, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020; however, generally accepted accounting principles require us to periodically report the amount by which the bonds' convertible value exceeds their principal amount, without regard to the current availability of the conversion feature. Further, the mechanics of the calculation require the use of an end-of-period stock price, so that using that amount at December 31, 2016, delivers an excess of $9,137,000, whereas the use of another price point would give a different result.\nThe conversion feature is generally available to the bondholders entering the last six months of the bonds' term but may also become actionable if the market price of NHI's common stock should, for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days within a calendar quarter, sustain a level in excess of 130% of the adjusted conversion price. The bonds are optional net-share settlement\u201d instruments, meaning that NHI has the ability and intent to settle the principal amount of the indebtedness in cash, with possible dilutive share issuances for any excess, at NHI's option. While retaining the option to settle the excess of the bond conversion value over their face amount in cash, management believes that, for a company with a market cap of approximately $3 billion, the potential issuance of approximately $9 million of additional shares (measured as of December 31, 2016) is minimally dilutive.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, including interest1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,440,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate purchase liabilities\n</td> <td>56,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction commitments\n</td> <td>16,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>53,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,567,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Interest is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2016.

While borrowings are used within the Senior Living portfolio to finance construction projects, including building additional units, up to $5,000,000 of the facility may be used to meet general working-capital needs. In March 2016, we extended two additional mezzanine loans totaling $14,000,000 to affiliates of Senior Living, to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in South Carolina.\nSee Note 4 for full details of our loan commitments. As provided above, loans funded do not include the effects of discounts or commitment fees. We expect to fully fund the Life Care Services Note A during 2017. Funding of the construction note commitment to Bickford is expected to transpire monthly throughout 2017.

The other three facilities are under construction by the developer.\nWe have committed $55,000,000 to the development of five senior housing facilities in Illinois and Virginia to be managed by Bickford, each consisting of 60 private-pay assisted living and memory care units. Total costs funded includes land and development costs incurred on the project as of December 31, 2016. One facility opened in July 2016, two opened in October 2016, and two are planned to open in the first half of 2017.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Funded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Remaining\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingencies:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East Lake Capital Management\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lease Inducement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sycamore Street (Bickford affiliate)\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Letter-of-credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Construction Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with our July 2015 lease to East Lake of three senior housing properties, NHI has committed to certain lease inducement payments of $8,000,000 contingent on reaching and maintaining certain metrics, which have been assessed as not probable of payment and which we have not recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. We are unaware of\ncircumstances that would change our initial assessment as to the contingent lease incentives. Not included in the above table is a seller earnout of $750,000, which was recorded on our balance sheet at acquisition in 2014.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a commitment on a letter of credit for the benefit of Sycamore, an affiliate of Bickford, which previously held a minority interest in PropCo. At December 31, 2016, our commitment on the letter of credit totaled $3,930,000. In connection with our funding commitment for the Illinois project discussed among loan commitments above, Bickford may also borrow an additional $2,000,000 upon achieving certain operating performance metrics.\nLitigation\nOur facilities are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Our lessees and borrowers have indemnified, and are obligated to continue to indemnify us, against all liabilities arising from the operation of the facilities, and are further obligated to indemnify us against environmental or title problems affecting the real estate underlying such facilities. While there may be lawsuits pending against certain of the owners and/or lessees of the facilities, management believes that the ultimate resolution of all such pending proceedings will have no material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFFO, AFFO & FAD\nThese supplemental operating performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, our Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nOur FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $(0.06) (1%) over the same period in 2015. Our normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.20 (4%) over the same period in 2015, primarily as the result of our new real estate investments in 2015 and 2016. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment, if applicable, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, recoveries of previous write-downs and the write off of debt issuance costs due to credit facility modifications.\nFFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nOur normalized AFFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.29 (7.1%) over the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized FFO, normalized AFFO excludes the impact of any straight-line rent revenue, amortization of the original issue discount on our convertible senior notes and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nNormalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nOur normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $17,077,000 (10.9%) over the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation. Normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD and is presented for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions and certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing Adjusted EBITDA for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of National Health Investors, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nExecutive Overview\nNational Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ( RIDEA\u201d) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We fund our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.\nPortfolio\nAt December 31, 2016, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 205 facilities located in 32 states. These investments involve 129 senior housing properties, 71 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $1,175,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,471,679,000, rented under triple-net leases to 27 lessees, and $133,493,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 11 borrowers.\nWe classify the properties in our portfolio as either senior housing or medical properties. We further classify our senior housing properties as either need-driven (assisted living facilities and senior living campuses) or discretionary (independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). Medical properties within our portfolio include skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\nThe following tables summarize our investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Properties\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds/Sq.

At December 31, 2016, such investments had a carrying value of $11,745,000.\nAreas of Focus\nWe are evaluating and will potentially make additional investments during the remainder of 2017 while we continue to monitor and improve our existing properties. We seek tenants who will become mission-oriented partners in relationships where our business goals are aligned. This approach fuels steady, and thus, enduring growth for those partners and for NHI. Within the context of our growth model, we rely on a cost-effective access to debt and equity capital to finance acquisitions that will drive our earnings. There is significant competition for healthcare assets from other REITs, both public and private, and from private equity sources. Large-scale portfolios continue to command premium pricing, due to the continued abundance of private and foreign buyers seeking to invest in healthcare real estate. This combination of circumstances places a premium on our ability to execute acquisitions and negotiate leases that will generate meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We emphasize growth with our existing tenants and borrowers as a way to insulate us from other competition.\nWith lower capitalization rates for existing healthcare facilities, there has been increased interest in constructing new facilities in hopes of generating better returns on invested capital. Using our relationship-driven model, we continue to look for opportunities to support new and existing tenants and borrowers with the capital needed to expand existing facilities and to initiate ground-up development of new facilities. We concentrate our efforts in those markets where there is both a demonstrated demand for a particular product type and where we perceive we have a competitive advantage. The projects we agree to finance have attractive upside potential and are expected to provide above-average returns to our shareholders to mitigate the risks inherent with property development and construction.\nOn December 16, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve announced an increase in its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The anticipation of this second increase in the federal funds rate in the past year has been a primary source of much volatility in REIT equity markets. The Committee also guided expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. As a result, there will be pressure on the spread between our cost of capital and the returns we earn. We expect that pressure to be partially mitigated by market forces that would tend to result in higher capitalization rates for healthcare assets and higher lease rates indicative of historical levels. Our cost of capital has increased over the past year as we transition some of our short term revolving borrowings into debt instruments with longer maturities and fixed interest rates. Managing long-term risk involves trade-offs with the competing alternative goal of maximizing short-term profitability. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing interests within the context of our investor profile. Due to more favorable pricing, we presently prefer private placement debt over a public offering of bond debt. As interest rates rise, our share price may decline as investors adjust prices to reflect a dividend yield that is sufficiently in excess of a risk free rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes and in recent years have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures. Over the past five years, we have selectively diversified our portfolio by directing a significant portion of our investments into properties which do not rely primarily on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, but rather on private pay sources (assisted living and memory care facilities, senior living campuses, independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). We will occasionally acquire skilled nursing facilities in good physical condition with a proven operator and strong local market fundamentals, because diversification implies a periodic rebalancing, but our recent investment focus has been on acquiring need-driven and discretionary senior housing assets.\nConsidering individual tenant lease revenue as a percentage of total revenue, Bickford Senior Living is our largest assisted living tenant, an affiliate of Holiday Retirement is our largest independent living tenant, National HealthCare Corporation is our largest skilled nursing tenant and Senior Living Communities is our largest entrance-fee community tenant. Our shift toward private payor facilities, as well as our expansion into the discretionary senior housing market, has further resulted in a portfolio whose current composition is relatively balanced between medical facilities, need-driven and discretionary senior housing.\nWe manage our business with a goal of increasing the regular annual dividends paid to shareholders. Our Board of Directors approves a regular quarterly dividend which is reflective of expected taxable income on a recurring basis. Our transactions that are infrequent and non-recurring that generate additional taxable income have been distributed to shareholders in the form of special dividends. Taxable income is determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and differs from net income for financial statements purposes determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our goal of increasing annual dividends requires a careful balance between identification of high-quality lease and mortgage assets in which to invest and the cost of our capital with which to fund such investments. We consider the competing interests of short and long-term debt (interest rates, maturities and other terms) versus the higher cost of new equity. We accept some level of risk associated with leveraging our investments. We intend to continue to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders.\nOur dividends for the current year and the last two years are as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investments in healthcare real estate have been partially accomplished by our ability to effectively leverage our balance sheet. However, we continue to maintain a relatively low-leverage balance sheet compared with many in our peer group. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions) to fixed charges (interest expense at contractual rates net of capitalized interest and principal payments on debt), and the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of our ability to service our debt. We use these two measures as a useful basis to compare the strength of our balance sheet with those in our peer group. We also believe this gives us a competitive advantage when accessing debt markets.\nWe calculate our fixed charge coverage ratio as approximately 5.8x for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to our net income on page 47). Giving effect to our acquisitions and financings on an annualized basis, our consolidated net debt-to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.4x for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(4,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,111,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized impact of recent investments\n</td> <td>17,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to current projections by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the number of Americans 65 and older is expected to grow 36% between 2010 and 2020, compared to a 9% growth rate for the general population. As Transgenerationalaging.org notes: The fastest growing segment of the total population is the oldest old - those 80 and over. Their growth rate is twice that of those 65 and over and almost 4 times that for the total population. In the United States, this group now represents 10% of the older population and will more than triple from 5.7 million in 2010 to over 19 million by 2050.\u201d\nWhile affordability issues will play a limiting role in the movement of this oldest age demographic into active participation in the senior care market, the swelling in the ranks of the very old is expected to increase demand for senior housing properties of all types in the coming decades. There is increasing demand for private-pay senior housing properties in countries outside the U.S. as well. We therefore consider real estate and note investments with U.S. entities who seek to expand their senior housing operations into countries where local-market demand is sufficiently demonstrated.\nStrong demographic trends provide the context for continued growth in 2017 and the years ahead. We plan to fund any new real estate and mortgage investments during 2017 using our liquid assets and debt financing. Should the weight of additional debt as a result of new acquisitions suggest the need to rebalance our capital structure, we would then expect to access the capital\nmarkets through an ATM or other equity offerings. Our disciplined investment strategy implemented through measured increments of debt and equity sets the stage for annual dividend growth, continued low leverage, a portfolio of diversified, high-quality assets, and business relationships with experienced operators who we make our priority, continue to be the key drivers of our business plan.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nWe consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:\n 1. the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and \n 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. \nOur significant accounting policies and the associated estimates, judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows:\nValuations and Impairments\nOur tenants and borrowers who operate SNFs derive their revenues primarily from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints. From time to time, there may be material changes in government reimbursement. In the past, SNFs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement.\nThe long-term health care industry has experienced significant professional liability claims which has resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance to cover potential claims. In previous years, these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers. In prior years, we have determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as a result of these events.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property-by-property basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment charge is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property.\nFor our mortgage and other notes receivable, we evaluate the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on an instrument-by-instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.\nWe evaluate our marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairments. An impairment of a marketable security would be considered other-than-temporary\u201d unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to (or beyond) the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time.\nThe initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to our acquisition of interests in the entity. An aggregate basis difference between the cost\nof our equity method investee and the amount of underlying equity in its net assets is primarily attributable to goodwill, which is not amortized. We evaluate for impairment our equity method investments and related goodwill based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the investments to their carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other than temporary, an impairment is recorded. No impairments to the carrying value of our equity method investee have been recorded for any period presented.\nThe determination of the fair value and whether a shortfall in operating revenues or the existence of operating losses is indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, the duration of the fair value deficiency, and any other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nWhile we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable, marketable securities and other investments are realizable, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe collect rent and interest from our tenants and borrowers. Generally, our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned. However, when we determine, based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, that rent or interest is not probable of collection until received, our policy is to recognize rental or interest income when assured, which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected. We identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. This policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period. As of December 31, 2016, we have one lease, a 126-unit portfolio, for which we recognize rent income when received. The tenant was current on its lease obligations at December 31, 2016, but we continue to classify as non-performing per policy. Revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible. Lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property, such as an increase in annual revenues over base year revenues, are considered to be contingent rentals, are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned.\nREIT Qualification\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. We believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to so qualify at all times. We record income tax expense or benefit with respect to our subsidiary which is taxed as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS\u201d) under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations. Aside from such income taxes that may be applicable to the taxable income in our TRS, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation\u201d (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that typically applies to corporate dividends. Our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable REIT qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate a legal entity deemed to be a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) when we determine that we are the VIE's primary beneficiary. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance for our arrangements with VIEs which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected\nresidual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We may change our assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.\nReal Estate Properties\nReal property we develop is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of interest during construction. The cost of real property investments we acquire is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land, equipment, buildings and other improvements, and intangible assets, if any. Our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term.\nSignificant Operators\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have four lessees (including their affiliated entities, which are the legal tenants) from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our rental income as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Renewal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holiday Retirement\n</td> <td>ILF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2031\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Living Communities\n</td> <td>EFC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2029\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National HealthCare Corporation\n</td> <td>SNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>ALF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All others\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,471,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to a combination of longer initial lease terms and generous escalators, straight line rent constituted a significant component of rental income recognized from the Holiday and Senior Living leases, whose communities we acquired in December 2013 and 2014, respectively. Straight-line rent of $8,965,000 and $10,466,000 was recognized from the Holiday lease for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Straight-line rent of $7,369,000 and $8,422,000 was recognized from the Senior Living lease for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Straight-line rent of $858,000 and $267,000 was recognized from the Bickford leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For NHC, rent escalations are based on a percentage increase in revenue over a base year and do not give rise to non-cash, straight-line rental income.\nRIDEA\nOn September 30, 2016, NHI and Sycamore Street, LLC ( Sycamore\u201d), an affiliate of Bickford Senior Living ( Bickford\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement terminating our joint venture consisting of the ownership and operation of 35 properties and converting Bickford's participation to a triple-net tenancy with assumption of existing leases and terms. Through September 30, 2016, NHI owned an 85% equity interest and Sycamore owned a 15% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary ( PropCo\u201d) which owned 35 assisted living/memory care facilities, three new facilities and two facilities in development. The facilities have been leased to an operating company ( OpCo\u201d), in which NHI previously held a non-controlling 85% ownership interest. The facilities are managed by Bickford. The joint venture was structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA.\nThe September 30, 2016 agreement provided for NHI's redemption of Bickford's 15% interest in the real estate underlying the joint venture (PropCo) for a distribution to Bickford of $25,100,000, before the offset by Bickford of $8,100,000 payable to NHI in acquisition of our non-controlling 85% interest in senior housing operations (OpCo), which NHI had carried on its balance sheet as an equity-method investment through September 30, 2016. The remaining distribution of $10,546,000 related to the transaction was settled, along with the final operational accounting, in November 2016.\nNHI's gain of $1,657,000 from the sale of OpCo was calculated on the difference between the proceeds of $8,100,000 and the carrying amount of our equity-method investment of $6,443,000. No gain or loss was recognized on our acquisition of Bickford's 15% interest in PropCo, which had previously been consolidated. Rather, Bickford's non-controlling interest was de-recognized, and the difference between the fair value of NHI's cost allocated to the redemption and the carrying amount for Bickford's non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity through capital in excess of par. See Investment Highlights below for a discussion of new investments with Bickford during 2016.\nProvisions governing details of the unwinding reach to our various arrangements with Bickford and include but are not limited to the following:\n \u2022 For the 32 stabilized facilities previously owned by the joint venture, forward annual contractual rent is unchanged at $26,454,000 plus annual escalators of 3% \n \u2022 For the five additional facilities under development owned by NHI, of which one opened in July 2016, two opened in October 2016, and two are planned to open in the first half of 2017, funded amounts will be added to the lease basis during construction and up to the first six months after opening; thereafter, base rent will be charged to Bickford at a 9% annual rate. Once the facilities are stabilized, as defined in the lease agreement, rent will be reset to fair market value. \n \u2022 Future development projects between the parties will be funded through a construction loan at 9% annual interest. NHI has a purchase option at stabilization, whereby rent will be set based on our total investment with a floor of 9.55% on NHI's total investment. \n \u2022 On current and future development projects, Bickford as the operator will be entitled to incentive payments based on the achievement of predetermined operational milestones, the funding of which will increase the investment base for determining the lease payment to NHI. \nThe income statements for OpCo include the operating results of 32 same-store properties and 5 properties under development or lease-up. For accounting purposes, we are required to expense the pre-opening expenses and operating losses of newly-developed properties.\nUnaudited summarized income statements for OpCo are presented below (in thousands):\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses, including management fees\n</td> <td>45,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease expense, including straight-line rent\n</td> <td>19,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,423\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net loss in OpCo for 2016 is primarily attributable to $619,000 in depreciation expense and $645,000 in excess expenses over revenues from the pre-opening and lease-up of three newly-constructed facilities opened during 2016.\nInvestment Highlights\nSince January 1, 2016, we have made or announced the following real estate and note investments ($ in thousands):\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Living Communities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chancellor Health Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watermark Retirement / East Lake Capital Mgmt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Ensign Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marathon/Village Concepts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Living Communities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Living Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Living Communities\nOn November 8, 2016, we acquired Evergreen Woods, a 299-unit entrance-fee community in Connecticut, for $74,000,000 in cash, inclusive of a $3,708,000 regulatory deposit. The facility was added to our existing master lease with Senior Living at the existing lease rate of 6.77%, subject to 4% escalation in January 2017 and 2018 and 3% annually thereafter with an initial term of 13 years, plus renewal options. Because Evergreen Woods was previously owner-operated, we accounted for our purchase of the property as an asset acquisition. As part of this transaction, we allocated $7,724,000 of the purchase price to the relative fair value of the land and $62,568,000 to the relative fair value of building and improvements.\nIn March 2016, we extended mezzanine loans of $12,000,000 and $2,000,000 to affiliates of Senior Living to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in North Carolina. The loans, which are payable monthly, bear interest at 10% per annum and mature in March 2021. The loans, having a total balance of $10,778,000 at December 31, 2016, are in addition to the $15,000,000 revolving line of credit we provided Senior Living in connection with our 2014 lease of 8 retirement communities.\nChancellor\nOn August 31, 2016, we acquired two facilities consisting of a senior living campus and a memory-care facility in McMinnville, Oregon, for $36,650,000 in cash inclusive of closing costs of $150,000. We leased the facilities to Chancellor Health Care for an initial lease term of 15 years, with renewal options, at an initial annual lease rate of 7.5% plus annual escalators. Because the facilities were owner-occupied, the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nSenior Living Management\nOn August 3, 2016, we entered into an agreement to furnish through its corporate entity and affiliates our current tenant, Senior Living Management ( SLM\u201d), Inc., with loans of up to $24,500,000 to facilitate SLM's acquisition of five senior housing facilities that it currently operates. The loans consist of two notes under a master credit agreement, include both a mortgage and a corporate loan, and bear interest at 8.25% with terms of five years, plus optional one and two-year extensions. NHI has a right of first refusal if SLM elects to sell one or more of the facilities. A total of $12,556,000 had been drawn on the two loans as of December 31, 2016. On January 17, 2017, the remaining amount under the loans was drawn.\nBickford\nOn July 15, 2016, NHI extended a $14,000,000 construction loan facility to Bickford for the purpose of developing and operating an assisted living/memory care community in Illinois. The total amount funded as of December 31, 2016 was $2,413,000, interest is to accrue at 9%, and the loan is to mature on July 15, 2021. The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage lien on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreement, including the borrower's obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. The loan and subject property were not included in the joint venture between the parties.\nOn June 1, 2016, in an asset acquisition, we acquired five assisted living and memory care facilities owned and operated by Bickford for $87,500,000, including $77,747,000 in cash and cancellation of notes and accrued interest receivable totaling $9,753,000. Additionally, we have committed $2,400,000 for capital improvements and expansion of the existing facilities, the funding of which will be added to the lease base. The lease provides for an initial rate of 7.25% and term of 15 years plus two five-year renewal options. The annual lease escalator is 3%. NHI's purchase option on an additional Bickford facility was relinquished. The facilities, consisting of 277 total units, are located in Iowa (2), Missouri, Illinois, and Nebraska. The facilities were not included in the RIDEA joint venture between the parties.\nWatermark Retirement / East Lake Capital\nOn June 1, 2016, NHI acquired two entrance fee continuing care retirement communities ( CCRCs\u201d) from funds managed by certain affiliates of East Lake Capital Management ( East Lake\u201d) for $56,300,000 in cash, inclusive of a $4,500,000 regulatory deposit, and entered into a lease transaction with affiliates of East Lake. NHI has committed up to an additional $10,000,000 for capital improvements and potential expansion of the communities over the next two years, of which $3,450,000 was drawn at December 31, 2016. The CCRCs consist of 460 units and are located in Bridgeport and Southbury, Connecticut. The communities are sub-leased to affiliates of Watermark Retirement Communities ( Watermark\u201d), the current manager. The lease has a term of 15 years, with an initial lease rate to East Lake of 7% on our total investment with escalators of 3.5% in years two through four, and 3% annually thereafter.\nIn conjunction with the lease, East Lake acquired a purchase option on the properties as a whole, exercisable beginning in year six of the lease. The option will be based on our initial acquisition cost, our funding of capital improvements and expansions, other additional funding that may then be in place, or further rent escalations during the remaining duration of the option window.\nEnsign Group\nOn April 1, 2016, we purchased eight skilled nursing facilities totaling 931 beds in Texas for $118,500,000 in cash. The facilities were owned and operated by NHI's existing tenant, Legend Healthcare ( Legend\u201d), and we accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition. Concurrent with the acquisition, we amended in-place leases covering the nine other skilled nursing facilities we leased to Legend, extending their provisions to the new facilities. The amendment also replaced purchase options that provided for equal sharing of any appreciation in value, within a specified range, with purchase options having a price determined at fair value, exercisable at the end of the lease term. Based on our analysis of the in-place rights, benefits and obligations, approximately $6,400,000 of the consideration in the acquisition from Legend was allocated to canceled provisions related to the in-place leases.\nLegend elected to transition its skilled nursing operations to a new operator on May 1, 2016, and NHI entered into a new 15-year master lease with affiliates of The Ensign Group, Inc. ( Ensign\u201d NASDAQ: ENSG) on 15 of the former Legend facilities for an initial annual amount of $17,750,000, plus an annual escalator based on inflation. NHI's total original investment in the 15 facilities leased to Ensign is approximately $211,000,000. The lease has two 5-year renewal options. Upon entering the new lease, NHI agreed to sell two existing skilled nursing facilities previously under lease to Legend in Texas totaling 245 beds to Ensign for $24,600,000. The Ensign lease, secured in part by the operator's corporate guaranty, replaces the amended Legend lease, and, accordingly, the rights, benefits and obligations held by Legend have terminated.\nAs part of this transaction, NHI is committed to purchase, from a developer, four new skilled nursing facilities in Texas for $56,000,000 which are leased to Legend and subleased to Ensign. The purchase window for the first facility is open through February 2017. The other three facilities are under construction by the developer.\nMarathon/Village Concepts\nOn January 15, 2016, we acquired a 98-unit independent living community in Chehalis, Washington, for $9,463,000 in cash inclusive of closing costs of $213,000 plus an additional commitment to fund $350,000 in specified capital improvements. We leased the facility to a partnership between Marathon Development and Village Concepts Retirement Communities for an initial lease term of 15 years. The lease provides for an initial annual lease rate of 7.25% plus annual escalators. Because the facility was owner-occupied, the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nReal Estate and Mortgage Write-downs\nOur borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to other health care providers. Governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower, or at least slow, the growth in payments to health care providers. Furthermore, the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly during this same period. Since inception, a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have undergone bankruptcy. Others have\nbeen forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or, for certain periods, have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us.\nWe believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral. However, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts. In recording the transition of our leases from Legend to Ensign in May 2016, we wrote off the $6,400,000 fair value assigned to the former Legend leases and $8,326,000 of accumulated straight-line rent receivable. Another $1,131,000 of accumulated straight-line receivables were written off in the preparation for transition to a new tenant in in the 126-unit portfolio mentioned under Other Portfolio Activity\u201d below.\nThe above write-offs have been classified among operating expenses as Loan and realty losses (recoveries)\u201d in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The losses are non-cash, transactional in nature, and relate to accounting conventions governing the recording of leases when a new lessee replaces a former lessee. Because these items may create some difficulty in comparing the current period to similar prior periods, we have adjusted their effect in our presentation of normalized non-GAAP financial measures.\nPotential Effects of Medicare Reimbursement\nOur tenants who operate SNFs receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare (federal) and Medicaid (states). Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to skilled nursing facilities could have a material impact on the operators' liquidity and financial condition. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) released a rule outlining a 1.6% increase in their Medicare reimbursement for fiscal year 2017 beginning on October 1, 2016. We currently estimate that our borrowers and lessees will be able to withstand this nominal Medicare increase due to their credit quality, profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios, although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect that similar Medicare increases on an annual basis would have on each of our borrowers and lessees. According to industry studies, state Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation. Federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to SNFs. Any near-term acquisitions of skilled nursing facilities are planned on a selective basis, with emphasis on operator quality and newer construction.\nOther Portfolio Activity\nOur leases are typically structured as triple net leases\u201d on single-tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. As such, there may be reporting periods in which we experience few, if any, lease renewals or expirations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not have any renewing or expiring leases.\nIn October 2016, as a result of material noncompliance with lease terms, we began exploratory measures to effect either transitioning the lease of a 126-unit assisted living portfolio from the current tenant or the marketing of the underlying properties. Either of these courses of action result in recording a reserve, for accounting purposes, at December 31, 2016, of $1,131,000 related to straight-line rent receivables and cessation of straight-line rent recognition. While straight-line receivables represent the effects of recognizing past and future escalations under terms of the lease using the straight-line method, we anticipate full recovery of all amounts billed to date under the lease. We have made no provision for any legal or other costs associated with the transition, as these amounts are neither estimable nor, in the opinion of management, material to our financial position or results of operations. Of our total revenues, $2,411,000, $2,497,000 and $2,604,000 were recognized as rental income from the portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn January 2016 we received full payment from an affiliate of our current lessee, Discovery Senior Living, on a $2,500,000 second mortgage loan we originally provided in October 2013 for the construction of a senior housing community in Naples, Florida. In November 2016 two mortgage loans on SNF properties in Virginia, carrying a total balance of $4,685,000, were paid in full.\nMost of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income with fixed contractual escalations is ordinarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in 2017, we are engaged in preliminary negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity. A summary of these tenant options to purchase senior housing communities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities is presented below:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>Lease\n</td> <td>1st Option\n</td> <td>Current\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type\n</td> <td>Facilities\n</td> <td>Expiration\n</td> <td>Open Year\n</td> <td>Cash Rent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MOB\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>February 2018\n</td> <td>Open\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>704,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>September 2027\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,248,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>December 2024\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,984,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>March 2025\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,778,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>June 2025\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,775,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>May 2031\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,004,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>June 2022\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,358,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Various\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,016,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation.\nTimber Ridge\nIn February 2015, we entered into an agreement to lend up to $154,500,000 to LCS-Westminster Partnership III LLP ( LCS-WP\u201d), an affiliate of Life Care Services ( LCS\u201d). The loan agreement conveys a mortgage interest and will facilitate the construction of Phase II of Timber Ridge at Talus ( Timber Ridge\u201d), a Type-A Continuing Care Retirement Community in Issaquah, WA managed by LCS.\nThe loan takes the form of two notes under a master credit agreement. The senior note ( Note A\u201d) totals $60,000,000 at a 6.75% interest rate with 10 basis-point escalators after year three, and has a term of 10 years. We have funded $42,944,000 of Note A as of December 31, 2016. Note A is interest-only and is locked to prepayment for three years. After year three, the prepayment penalty starts at 5% and declines 1% per year. The second note ( Note B\u201d) is a construction loan for up to $94,500,000 at an annual interest rate of 8% and a five-year maturity and was fully funded as of December 31, 2016. We expect substantial repayment with new resident entrance fees from the opening of Phase II in October, 2016. Repayment of Note B amounted to $61,289,000 as of December 31, 2016, plus an additional $7,304,000 through February 15, 2017.\nNHI has a purchase option on the entire Timber Ridge property for the greater of fair market value or $115,000,000 during a purchase option window of 120 days that will contingently open in year five or upon earlier stabilization of the development, as defined. The current basis of our investment in Timber Ridge loans, net of unamortized commitment fees, is $75,112,000, but we are obligated to complete the funding of Note A up to $60,000,000.\nResults of

of the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015 were as follows:\n \u2022 Rental income increased $17,946,000, or 8.4%, primarily as a result of new investments funded in 2015 and 2016. The increase in rental income included a $2,425,000 decrease in straight-line rent adjustments. Generally accepted accounting principles require rental income to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease to give effect to scheduled rent escalators that are determinable at lease inception. Generally, future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \n \u2022 Interest income from mortgage and other notes increased $3,599,000 primarily due to advances made on our mortgage and construction loan commitment to the Timber Ridge entrance fee community as described in Investment Highlights, partially offset by lower interest income from notes paid off during 2016. We expect total interest income from our loan portfolio to decrease as repayments of our $94,500,000 construction loan to Timber Ridge began in October 2016 and we expect the loan to be substantially repaid during 2017. Repayments amounted to $61,289,000 as of December 31, 2016, plus an additional $7,304,000 through February 15, 2017. \n \u2022 Interest income from our loan portfolio is also subject to decrease due to normal maturities, scheduled principal amortization and early payoffs of individual loans. \n \u2022 Investment income decreased primarily due to our decision to sell 1,043,800 shares of LTC, Inc. common stock. \n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $6,402,000 primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. \n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts, increased $5,479,000 primarily as a result of the timing and amount of new borrowings and our strategic focus to refinance short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility at variable interest rates with long-term debt at fixed rates. This strategy helps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and locks in the investment spread between our lease revenue and our cost of debt capital. \n \u2022 Loan and realty losses of $15,856,000 relate to non-cash transactional write-offs involving the acquisition of eight skilled nursing facilities from Legend and transition of a total of 15 SNF leases to Ensign in the second quarter of 2016, and the non-cash write-off of straight-line rent receivable during the third quarter of 2016 resulting from a tenant's material non-compliance with our lease terms and our planned transition to another tenant or to market the properties. \n \u2022 The loss from equity method investee of $1,214,000 reflects our pro rata portion of the investee's net loss for 2016 as described earlier in our discussion of our joint venture with a Bickford affiliate which was terminated on September 30, 2016. \n \u2022 Investment and other gains includes $29,673,000 from the sale of marketable securities, $2,805,000 from the sale of two Texas skilled nursing facilities in May 2016, $1,654,000 from the sale of an Idaho skilled nursing facility in March 2016, $123,000 from the sale

primarily to our SLC acquisition in December 2014 and other real estate investments completed during 2014 and 2015. During 2015 we completed $155,575,000 of new real estate investments. During 2014, we completed $555,453,000 of new real estate investments. The increase in rental income included an $8,159,000 increase in straight-line rent adjustments. Generally accepted accounting principles require rental income to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease to give effect to scheduled rent escalators. Future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \n \u2022 Interest income from mortgage and other notes increased $2,965,000 primarily due to borrowings of $83,411,000 on our new loan commitment to the Timber Ridge entrance fee community as described in Investment Highlights. We expect total interest income from our loan portfolio to increase as we continue to fund these loans to Timber Ridge on a monthly basis throughout 2016. Repayment of our construction loan of $94,500,000 to Timber Ridge began during October 2016. Interest income from our loan portfolio is subject to decrease due to normal maturities, scheduled principal amortization and early payoffs of individual loans. \n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $15,085,000 compared to the prior year primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2014 and 2015. \n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts, increased $13,402,000 primarily as a result of the timing and amount of new borrowings and our strategic focus to refinance short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility at variable interest rates with long-term debt at fixed rates. This strategy helps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and locks in the investment spread between our lease revenue and our cost of debt capital. \n \u2022 Dues, marketing and professional fees have increased as a result of (a) marketing and promotional expenses incurred as NHI continues to participate actively in industry groups and in expanding its awareness among owners and operators in the asset classes in which it makes investments and (b) the professional fees associated with the volume of new investments and new financing arrangements during 2015. \n \u2022 We received $491,000 as a secured creditor in the final settlement of a bankruptcy proceeding involving one of our former borrowers. The loan had previously been written off. We recorded the receipt as a loan recovery. \n \u2022 The loss from equity method investee of $1,767,000 reflects our pro rata portion of the investee's net loss for 2015 as described earlier in our discussion of our joint venture with Sycamore Street. \n \u2022 Investment and other gains for 2015 represent gains of $23,529,000 on the sales of marketable securities and a gain of $1,126,000 on the sale of two properties to our tenant Fundamental. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur primary sources of cash include rent payments, principal and interest payments on mortgage and other notes receivable, interest and dividends received on our marketable securities, proceeds from the sales of real property, net proceeds from offerings of equity securities and borrowings from our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash include debt service payments (both principal and interest), new investments in real estate and notes, dividend distributions to our shareholders and general corporate overhead.\nThese sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,025\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>177,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(329,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136,326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193,512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(540,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>144,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(424,248\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(104.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased primarily as a result of the collection of lease and interest payments on new real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased primarily due to $486,788,000 of investments in real estate and notes which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable, sales of marketable securities and certain real estate assets.\nFinancing Activities - The change in net cash related to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily the result of borrowings on our revolving credit facility, $75,000,000 in unsecured debt from a private placement lender and $104,190,000 in proceeds from stock issuances. These capital sources were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders which increased $13,646,000 over the same period in 2015 due to a 5.9% increase in our per share dividend and the issuance of additional common shares during 2016.\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2016, our liquidity was strong, with $396,832,000 available in cash and borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nOur ATM program, discussed below, and our investment in marketable securities, carried at fair value of approximately $11,745,000 at December 31, 2016, represent additional sources of liquidity. Traditionally, debt financing and cash resulting from operating and financing activities, which are derived from proceeds of lease and mortgage collections, loan payoffs and the recovery of previous write-downs, have been used to satisfy our operational and investing needs and to provide a return to our shareholders. Those operational and investing needs reflect the resources necessary to maintain and cultivate our funding sources and have generally fallen into three categories: debt service, REIT operating expenses, and new real estate investments.\nIn June 2015, we entered into an amended $800,000,000 senior unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. The facility can be expanded, subject to certain conditions, up to an additional $250,000,000. The amended credit facility provides for: (1) a $550,000,000 revolving credit facility that matures in June 2020 (inclusive of an embedded 1-year extension option) with interest at 150 basis points over 30-day LIBOR (77 bps at December 31, 2016); (2) an existing $130,000,000 term loan that matures in June 2020 with interest at 175 basis points over LIBOR of which interest of 3.91% is fixed with an interest rate swap agreement; and (3) two existing term loans which also remain in place totaling $120,000,000, maturing in June 2020 and bearing interest at 175 basis points over LIBOR,with a notional amount of $40,000,000 being fixed at 3.29% until 2019 and $80,000,000 being fixed at 3.86% until 2020.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $392,000,000 available to draw on the revolving portion of the credit facility. The unused commitment fee is 40 basis points per annum. The unsecured credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios within limits set by our creditors. To date, these ratios, which are calculated quarterly, have been within the limits required by the credit facility agreements.\nWe began liquidating our position in LTC Properties, Inc. ( LTC\u201d) common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, we sold 1,043,800 shares in a further reduction of our LTC holdings, realizing net proceeds of $49,022,000 from these sales. In addition, we realized $17,048,000 in proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities held at amortized cost. A taxable gain of approximately $29,673,000 resulting therefrom is expected to be adequately offset by depreciation and other deductions in the calculation of our REIT taxable income, making all of the proceeds available for deployment. We held 250,000 shares of LTC common shares as of December 31, 2016.\nIn June 2016, we completed an at-the market ( ATM\u201d) equity offering. With a weighted average price for shares sold of $71.30, we issued 714,666 common shares resulting in net proceeds of $50,189,000, which we used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We sold additional shares under our ATM program beginning in August 2016 to provide ratable equity funding for our third quarter investments and in anticipation of our Evergreen acquisition announced November 3, 2016. We obtained an weighted average price for shares sold of $80.51, in issuing 680,976 common shares, resulting in net proceeds of $54,001,000.\nThe use of funds from our ATM and the sales of LTC common stock effected a rebalancing of our leverage in response to our year-to-date acquisitions and keeps our options flexible for further expansion. We continue to explore various other funding sources including bank term loans, convertible debt, traditional equity placement, unsecured bonds and senior notes, debt private placement and secured government agency financing. We view our ATM program as an effective way to match-fund our smaller acquisitions by exercising control over the timing and size of transactions and achieving a more favorable cost of capital as compared to larger follow-on offerings.\nWe expect that borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on term loans, liquidation of our marketable securities and our ATM program will allow us to continue to make real estate investments during 2017.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit facility. The ATM offerings have been made pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated February 17, 2015 and a related prospectus dated March 18, 2014, which constitute a part of NHI's effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect to file a new registration statement and commence a new ATM program in first quarter 2017.\nTo mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk, we have entered into the following interest rate swap contracts on three of our term loans as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Date Entered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.86%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,612\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d), and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, which is reported in current period earnings as interest expense, was not significant for the three years ended December 31, 2016.\nWe periodically refinance the borrowings on our revolving credit facility through the ATM and longer-term debt instruments. We consider secured debt from U.S. Govt. agencies, including HUD, private placements of unsecured debt, and public offerings of debt and equity. We anticipate that our historically low cost of debt capital will rise in the near to mid-term, as the federal government continues its upward transitioning of the Federal funds rate.\nIf we modify or replace existing debt, we would incur debt issuance costs. These fees would be subject to amortization over the term of the new debt instrument and may result in the write-off of fees associated with debt which has been replaced or modified. Sustaining long-term dividend growth will require that we consider all forms of capital mentioned above, with the goal of maintaining a low-leverage balance sheet as mitigation against potential adverse changes in the business of our tenants and borrowers.\nWe intend to comply with REIT dividend requirements that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2016 and thereafter. Dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following January and are, with some exceptions, treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended\nas provided in IRS Code Sec. 857(b)(8). We declare special dividends when we compute our REIT taxable income in an amount that exceeds our regular dividends for the fiscal year.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no outstanding guarantees. For additional information on our letter of credit with Sycamore, an affiliate of Bickford, see our discussion in this section under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities below. Our loans to LCS-WP and our lease with East Lake represent variable interests in those enterprises. However, because we do not control these entities, nor do we have any role in their day-to-day management, we are not their primary beneficiary. Except as discussed below under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities, we have no further material obligations arising from our transactions with these entities, and we believe our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2016, due to this involvement would be limited to our contractual commitments and contingent liabilities and the amount of our current investments with them, as detailed further in Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2014 we issued $200,000,000 of convertible bonds, the conversion feature being intended to broaden the Company's credit profile and as a means to obtain a more favorable coupon rate. For this feature we calculate the dilutive effect using market prices prevailing over the reporting period. Because the dilution calculation is market-driven, and per share guidance we provide is based on diluted amounts, the theoretical effects of the conversion feature result in per share unpredictability.\nAdditional disclosure requirements also give widely ranging results depending on market price variability. The bonds will be freely convertible in the last six months of their contractual life, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020; however, generally accepted accounting principles require us to periodically report the amount by which the bonds' convertible value exceeds their principal amount, without regard to the current availability of the conversion feature. Further, the mechanics of the calculation require the use of an end-of-period stock price, so that using that amount at December 31, 2016, delivers an excess of $9,137,000, whereas the use of another price point would give a different result.\nThe conversion feature is generally available to the bondholders entering the last six months of the bonds' term but may also become actionable if the market price of NHI's common stock should, for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days within a calendar quarter, sustain a level in excess of 130% of the adjusted conversion price. The bonds are optional net-share settlement\u201d instruments, meaning that NHI has the ability and intent to settle the principal amount of the indebtedness in cash, with possible dilutive share issuances for any excess, at NHI's option. While retaining the option to settle the excess of the bond conversion value over their face amount in cash, management believes that, for a company with a market cap of approximately $3 billion, the potential issuance of approximately $9 million of additional shares (measured as of December 31, 2016) is minimally dilutive.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, including interest1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,440,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate purchase liabilities\n</td> <td>56,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction commitments\n</td> <td>16,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>53,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,567,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Interest is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2016.

While borrowings are used within the Senior Living portfolio to finance construction projects, including building additional units, up to $5,000,000 of the facility may be used to meet general working-capital needs. In March 2016, we extended two additional mezzanine loans totaling $14,000,000 to affiliates of Senior Living, to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in South Carolina.\nSee Note 4 for full details of our loan commitments. As provided above, loans funded do not include the effects of discounts or commitment fees. We expect to fully fund the Life Care Services Note A during 2017. Funding of the construction note commitment to Bickford is expected to transpire monthly throughout 2017.

The other three facilities are under construction by the developer.\nWe have committed $55,000,000 to the development of five senior housing facilities in Illinois and Virginia to be managed by Bickford, each consisting of 60 private-pay assisted living and memory care units. Total costs funded includes land and development costs incurred on the project as of December 31, 2016.

We are unaware of\ncircumstances that would change our initial assessment as to the contingent lease incentives. Not included in the above table is a seller earnout of $750,000, which was recorded on our balance sheet at acquisition in 2014.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a commitment on a letter of credit for the benefit of Sycamore, an affiliate of Bickford, which previously held a minority interest in PropCo. At December 31, 2016, our commitment on the letter of credit totaled $3,930,000. In connection with our funding commitment for the Illinois project discussed among loan commitments above, Bickford may also borrow an additional $2,000,000 upon achieving certain operating performance metrics.\nLitigation\nOur facilities are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Our lessees and borrowers have indemnified, and are obligated to continue to indemnify us, against all liabilities arising from the operation of the facilities, and are further obligated to indemnify us against environmental or title problems affecting the real estate underlying such facilities. While there may be lawsuits pending against certain of the owners and/or lessees of the facilities, management believes that the ultimate resolution of all such pending proceedings will have no material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFFO, AFFO & FAD\nThese supplemental operating performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, our Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nOur FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $(0.06) (1%) over the same period in 2015. Our normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.20 (4%) over the same period in 2015, primarily as the result of our new real estate investments in 2015 and 2016. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment, if applicable, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, recoveries of previous write-downs and the write off of debt issuance costs due to credit facility modifications.\nFFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nOur normalized AFFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.29 (7.1%) over the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized FFO, normalized AFFO excludes the impact of any straight-line rent revenue, amortization of the original issue discount on our convertible senior notes and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nNormalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nOur normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $17,077,000 (10.9%) over the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation. Normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD and is presented for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

an indication of our ability to service debt. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions and certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing Adjusted EBITDA for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs. Since others may not use our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, caution should be exercised when comparing our Adjusted EBITDA to that of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense at contractual rates\n</td> <td>40,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise, excise and other taxes\n</td> <td>1,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense) of taxable REIT subsidiary\n</td> <td>749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(707\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation in continuing and discontinued operations\n</td> <td>59,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs and bond discount\n</td> <td>3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>(4,582\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of marketable securities\n</td> <td>(29,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of equity-method investee\n</td> <td>(1,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs expensed due to credit facility modifications\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-off of unamortized debt premium\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash write-off of straight-line rent receivable\n</td> <td>9,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-off of lease intangible\n</td> <td>6,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue recognized due to early lease termination\n</td> <td>(303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs under business combination accounting\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recognition of unamortized mortgage note discount\n</td> <td>(288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recovery of previous write-down\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of National Health Investors, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nExecutive Overview\nNational Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ( RIDEA\u201d) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We fund our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.\nPortfolio\nAt December 31, 2016, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 205 facilities located in 32 states. These investments involve 129 senior housing properties, 71 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $1,175,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,471,679,000, rented under triple-net leases to 27 lessees, and $133,493,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 11 borrowers.\nWe classify the properties in our portfolio as either senior housing or medical properties. We further classify our senior housing properties as either need-driven (assisted living facilities and senior living campuses) or discretionary (independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). Medical properties within our portfolio include skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\nThe following tables summarize our investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our tenants who provided more than 3% of our total revenues were (parent company, in alphabetical order): Bickford Senior Living; East Lake Capital Management; The Ensign Group; Holiday Retirement; National HealthCare Corporation; and Senior Living Communities.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our average effective annualized rental income was $8,141 per bed for SNFs, $15,364 per unit for ALFs, $14,328 per unit for ILFs, $20,810 per unit for EFCs, $42,499 per bed for hospitals, and $11 per square foot for MOBs.\nWe currently invest a portion of our funds in highly liquid marketable securities, including the common shares of other publicly held healthcare REITs. At December 31, 2016, such investments had a carrying value of $11,745,000.\nAreas of Focus\nWe are evaluating and will potentially make additional investments during the remainder of 2017 while we continue to monitor and improve our existing properties. We seek tenants who will become mission-oriented partners in relationships where our business goals are aligned. This approach fuels steady, and thus, enduring growth for those partners and for NHI. Within the context of our growth model, we rely on a cost-effective access to debt and equity capital to finance acquisitions that will drive our earnings. There is significant competition for healthcare assets from other REITs, both public and private, and from private equity sources. Large-scale portfolios continue to command premium pricing, due to the continued abundance of private and foreign buyers seeking to invest in healthcare real estate. This combination of circumstances places a premium on our ability to execute acquisitions and negotiate leases that will generate meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We emphasize growth with our existing tenants and borrowers as a way to insulate us from other competition.\nWith lower capitalization rates for existing healthcare facilities, there has been increased interest in constructing new facilities in hopes of generating better returns on invested capital. Using our relationship-driven model, we continue to look for opportunities to support new and existing tenants and borrowers with the capital needed to expand existing facilities and to initiate ground-up development of new facilities. We concentrate our efforts in those markets where there is both a demonstrated demand for a particular product type and where we perceive we have a competitive advantage. The projects we agree to finance have attractive upside potential and are expected to provide above-average returns to our shareholders to mitigate the risks inherent with property development and construction.\nOn December 16, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve announced an increase in its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The anticipation of this second increase in the federal funds rate in the past year has been a primary source of much volatility in REIT equity markets. The Committee also guided expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. As a result, there will be pressure on the spread between our cost of capital and the returns we earn. We expect that pressure to be partially mitigated by market forces that would tend to result in higher capitalization rates for healthcare assets and higher lease rates indicative of historical levels. Our cost of capital has increased over the past year as we transition some of our short term revolving borrowings into debt instruments with longer maturities and fixed interest rates. Managing long-term risk involves trade-offs with the competing alternative goal of maximizing short-term profitability. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing interests within the context of our investor profile. Due to more favorable pricing, we presently prefer private placement debt over a public offering of bond debt. As interest rates rise, our share price may decline as investors adjust prices to reflect a dividend yield that is sufficiently in excess of a risk free rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes and in recent years have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures. Over the past five years, we have selectively diversified our portfolio by directing a significant portion of our investments into properties which do not rely primarily on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, but rather on private pay sources (assisted living and memory care facilities, senior living campuses, independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). We will occasionally acquire skilled nursing facilities in good physical condition with a proven operator and strong local market fundamentals, because diversification implies a periodic rebalancing, but our recent investment focus has been on acquiring need-driven and discretionary senior housing assets.\nConsidering individual tenant lease revenue as a percentage of total revenue, Bickford Senior Living is our largest assisted living tenant, an affiliate of Holiday Retirement is our largest independent living tenant, National HealthCare Corporation is our largest skilled nursing tenant and Senior Living Communities is our largest entrance-fee community tenant. Our shift toward private payor facilities, as well as our expansion into the discretionary senior housing market, has further resulted in a portfolio whose current composition is relatively balanced between medical facilities, need-driven and discretionary senior housing.\nWe manage our business with a goal of increasing the regular annual dividends paid to shareholders. Our Board of Directors approves a regular quarterly dividend which is reflective of expected taxable income on a recurring basis. Our transactions that are infrequent and non-recurring that generate additional taxable income have been distributed to shareholders in the form of special dividends. Taxable income is determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and differs from net income for financial statements purposes determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our goal of increasing annual dividends requires a careful balance between identification of high-quality lease and mortgage assets in which to invest and the cost of our capital with which to fund such investments. We consider the competing interests of short and long-term debt (interest rates, maturities and other terms) versus the higher cost of new equity. We accept some level of risk associated with leveraging our investments. We intend to continue to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders.\nOur dividends for the current year and the last two years are as follows:\n\nOur investments in healthcare real estate have been partially accomplished by our ability to effectively leverage our balance sheet. However, we continue to maintain a relatively low-leverage balance sheet compared with many in our peer group. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions) to fixed charges (interest expense at contractual rates net of capitalized interest and principal payments on debt), and the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of our ability to service our debt. We use these two measures as a useful basis to compare the strength of our balance sheet with those in our peer group. We also believe this gives us a competitive advantage when accessing debt markets.\nWe calculate our fixed charge coverage ratio as approximately 5.8x for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to our net income on page 47). Giving effect to our acquisitions and financings on an annualized basis, our consolidated net debt-to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.4x for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nAccording to current projections by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the number of Americans 65 and older is expected to grow 36% between 2010 and 2020, compared to a 9% growth rate for the general population. As Transgenerationalaging.org notes: The fastest growing segment of the total population is the oldest old - those 80 and over. Their growth rate is twice that of those 65 and over and almost 4 times that for the total population. In the United States, this group now represents 10% of the older population and will more than triple from 5.7 million in 2010 to over 19 million by 2050.\u201d\nWhile affordability issues will play a limiting role in the movement of this oldest age demographic into active participation in the senior care market, the swelling in the ranks of the very old is expected to increase demand for senior housing properties of all types in the coming decades. There is increasing demand for private-pay senior housing properties in countries outside the U.S. as well. We therefore consider real estate and note investments with U.S. entities who seek to expand their senior housing operations into countries where local-market demand is sufficiently demonstrated.\nStrong demographic trends provide the context for continued growth in 2017 and the years ahead. We plan to fund any new real estate and mortgage investments during 2017 using our liquid assets and debt financing. Should the weight of additional debt as a result of new acquisitions suggest the need to rebalance our capital structure, we would then expect to access the capital\nmarkets through an ATM or other equity offerings. Our disciplined investment strategy implemented through measured increments of debt and equity sets the stage for annual dividend growth, continued low leverage, a portfolio of diversified, high-quality assets, and business relationships with experienced operators who we make our priority, continue to be the key drivers of our business plan.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nWe consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:\n 1. the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and \n 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. \nOur significant accounting policies and the associated estimates, judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows:\nValuations and Impairments\nOur tenants and borrowers who operate SNFs derive their revenues primarily from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints. From time to time, there may be material changes in government reimbursement. In the past, SNFs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement.\nThe long-term health care industry has experienced significant professional liability claims which has resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance to cover potential claims. In previous years, these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers. In prior years, we have determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as a result of these events.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property-by-property basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment charge is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property.\nFor our mortgage and other notes receivable, we evaluate the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on an instrument-by-instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.\nWe evaluate our marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairments. An impairment of a marketable security would be considered other-than-temporary\u201d unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to (or beyond) the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time.\nThe initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to our acquisition of interests in the entity. An aggregate basis difference between the cost\nof our equity method investee and the amount of underlying equity in its net assets is primarily attributable to goodwill, which is not amortized. We evaluate for impairment our equity method investments and related goodwill based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the investments to their carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other than temporary, an impairment is recorded. No impairments to the carrying value of our equity method investee have been recorded for any period presented.\nThe determination of the fair value and whether a shortfall in operating revenues or the existence of operating losses is indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, the duration of the fair value deficiency, and any other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nWhile we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable, marketable securities and other investments are realizable, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe collect rent and interest from our tenants and borrowers. Generally, our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned. However, when we determine, based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, that rent or interest is not probable of collection until received, our policy is to recognize rental or interest income when assured, which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected. We identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. This policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period. As of December 31, 2016, we have one lease, a 126-unit portfolio, for which we recognize rent income when received. The tenant was current on its lease obligations at December 31, 2016, but we continue to classify as non-performing per policy. Revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible. Lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property, such as an increase in annual revenues over base year revenues, are considered to be contingent rentals, are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned.\nREIT Qualification\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. We believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to so qualify at all times. We record income tax expense or benefit with respect to our subsidiary which is taxed as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS\u201d) under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations. Aside from such income taxes that may be applicable to the taxable income in our TRS, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation\u201d (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that typically applies to corporate dividends. Our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable REIT qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate a legal entity deemed to be a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) when we determine that we are the VIE's primary beneficiary. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance for our arrangements with VIEs which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected\nresidual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We may change our assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.\nReal Estate Properties\nReal property we develop is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of interest during construction. The cost of real property investments we acquire is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land, equipment, buildings and other improvements, and intangible assets, if any. Our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term.\nSignificant Operators\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have four lessees (including their affiliated entities, which are the legal tenants) from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our rental income as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nDue to a combination of longer initial lease terms and generous escalators, straight line rent constituted a significant component of rental income recognized from the Holiday and Senior Living leases, whose communities we acquired in December 2013 and 2014, respectively. Straight-line rent of $8,965,000 and $10,466,000 was recognized from the Holiday lease for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Straight-line rent of $7,369,000 and $8,422,000 was recognized from the Senior Living lease for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Straight-line rent of $858,000 and $267,000 was recognized from the Bickford leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For NHC, rent escalations are based on a percentage increase in revenue over a base year and do not give rise to non-cash, straight-line rental income.\nRIDEA\nOn September 30, 2016, NHI and Sycamore Street, LLC ( Sycamore\u201d), an affiliate of Bickford Senior Living ( Bickford\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement terminating our joint venture consisting of the ownership and operation of 35 properties and converting Bickford's participation to a triple-net tenancy with assumption of existing leases and terms. Through September 30, 2016, NHI owned an 85% equity interest and Sycamore owned a 15% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary ( PropCo\u201d) which owned 35 assisted living/memory care facilities, three new facilities and two facilities in development. The facilities have been leased to an operating company ( OpCo\u201d), in which NHI previously held a non-controlling 85% ownership interest. The facilities are managed by Bickford. The joint venture was structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA.\nThe September 30, 2016 agreement provided for NHI's redemption of Bickford's 15% interest in the real estate underlying the joint venture (PropCo) for a distribution to Bickford of $25,100,000, before the offset by Bickford of $8,100,000 payable to NHI in acquisition of our non-controlling 85% interest in senior housing operations (OpCo), which NHI had carried on its balance sheet as an equity-method investment through September 30, 2016. The remaining distribution of $10,546,000 related to the transaction was settled, along with the final operational accounting, in November 2016.\nNHI's gain of $1,657,000 from the sale of OpCo was calculated on the difference between the proceeds of $8,100,000 and the carrying amount of our equity-method investment of $6,443,000. No gain or loss was recognized on our acquisition of Bickford's 15% interest in PropCo, which had previously been consolidated. Rather, Bickford's non-controlling interest was de-recognized, and the difference between the fair value of NHI's cost allocated to the redemption and the carrying amount for Bickford's non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity through capital in excess of par. See Investment Highlights below for a discussion of new investments with Bickford during 2016.\nProvisions governing details of the unwinding reach to our various arrangements with Bickford and include but are not limited to the following:\n \u2022 For the 32 stabilized facilities previously owned by the joint venture, forward annual contractual rent is unchanged at $26,454,000 plus annual escalators of 3% \n \u2022 For the five additional facilities under development owned by NHI, of which one opened in July 2016, two opened in October 2016, and two are planned to open in the first half of 2017, funded amounts will be added to the lease basis during construction and up to the first six months after opening; thereafter, base rent will be charged to Bickford at a 9% annual rate. Once the facilities are stabilized, as defined in the lease agreement, rent will be reset to fair market value. \n \u2022 Future development projects between the parties will be funded through a construction loan at 9% annual interest. NHI has a purchase option at stabilization, whereby rent will be set based on our total investment with a floor of 9.55% on NHI's total investment. \n \u2022 On current and future development projects, Bickford as the operator will be entitled to incentive payments based on the achievement of predetermined operational milestones, the funding of which will increase the investment base for determining the lease payment to NHI. \nThe income statements for OpCo include the operating results of 32 same-store properties and 5 properties under development or lease-up. For accounting purposes, we are required to expense the pre-opening expenses and operating losses of newly-developed properties.\nUnaudited summarized income statements for OpCo are presented below (in thousands):\n\nThe net loss in OpCo for 2016 is primarily attributable to $619,000 in depreciation expense and $645,000 in excess expenses over revenues from the pre-opening and lease-up of three newly-constructed facilities opened during 2016.\nInvestment Highlights\nSince January 1, 2016, we have made or announced the following real estate and note investments ($ in thousands):\n\nSenior Living Communities\nOn November 8, 2016, we acquired Evergreen Woods, a 299-unit entrance-fee community in Connecticut, for $74,000,000 in cash, inclusive of a $3,708,000 regulatory deposit. The facility was added to our existing master lease with Senior Living at the existing lease rate of 6.77%, subject to 4% escalation in January 2017 and 2018 and 3% annually thereafter with an initial term of 13 years, plus renewal options. Because Evergreen Woods was previously owner-operated, we accounted for our purchase of the property as an asset acquisition. As part of this transaction, we allocated $7,724,000 of the purchase price to the relative fair value of the land and $62,568,000 to the relative fair value of building and improvements.\nIn March 2016, we extended mezzanine loans of $12,000,000 and $2,000,000 to affiliates of Senior Living to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in North Carolina. The loans, which are payable monthly, bear interest at 10% per annum and mature in March 2021. The loans, having a total balance of $10,778,000 at December 31, 2016, are in addition to the $15,000,000 revolving line of credit we provided Senior Living in connection with our 2014 lease of 8 retirement communities.\nChancellor\nOn August 31, 2016, we acquired two facilities consisting of a senior living campus and a memory-care facility in McMinnville, Oregon, for $36,650,000 in cash inclusive of closing costs of $150,000. We leased the facilities to Chancellor Health Care for an initial lease term of 15 years, with renewal options, at an initial annual lease rate of 7.5% plus annual escalators. Because the facilities were owner-occupied, the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nSenior Living Management\nOn August 3, 2016, we entered into an agreement to furnish through its corporate entity and affiliates our current tenant, Senior Living Management ( SLM\u201d), Inc., with loans of up to $24,500,000 to facilitate SLM's acquisition of five senior housing facilities that it currently operates. The loans consist of two notes under a master credit agreement, include both a mortgage and a corporate loan, and bear interest at 8.25% with terms of five years, plus optional one and two-year extensions. NHI has a right of first refusal if SLM elects to sell one or more of the facilities. A total of $12,556,000 had been drawn on the two loans as of December 31, 2016. On January 17, 2017, the remaining amount under the loans was drawn.\nBickford\nOn July 15, 2016, NHI extended a $14,000,000 construction loan facility to Bickford for the purpose of developing and operating an assisted living/memory care community in Illinois. The total amount funded as of December 31, 2016 was $2,413,000, interest is to accrue at 9%, and the loan is to mature on July 15, 2021. The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage lien on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreement, including the borrower's obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. The loan and subject property were not included in the joint venture between the parties.\nOn June 1, 2016, in an asset acquisition, we acquired five assisted living and memory care facilities owned and operated by Bickford for $87,500,000, including $77,747,000 in cash and cancellation of notes and accrued interest receivable totaling $9,753,000. Additionally, we have committed $2,400,000 for capital improvements and expansion of the existing facilities, the funding of which will be added to the lease base. The lease provides for an initial rate of 7.25% and term of 15 years plus two five-year renewal options. The annual lease escalator is 3%. NHI's purchase option on an additional Bickford facility was relinquished. The facilities, consisting of 277 total units, are located in Iowa (2), Missouri, Illinois, and Nebraska. The facilities were not included in the RIDEA joint venture between the parties.\nWatermark Retirement / East Lake Capital\nOn June 1, 2016, NHI acquired two entrance fee continuing care retirement communities ( CCRCs\u201d) from funds managed by certain affiliates of East Lake Capital Management ( East Lake\u201d) for $56,300,000 in cash, inclusive of a $4,500,000 regulatory deposit, and entered into a lease transaction with affiliates of East Lake. NHI has committed up to an additional $10,000,000 for capital improvements and potential expansion of the communities over the next two years, of which $3,450,000 was drawn at December 31, 2016. The CCRCs consist of 460 units and are located in Bridgeport and Southbury, Connecticut. The communities are sub-leased to affiliates of Watermark Retirement Communities ( Watermark\u201d), the current manager. The lease has a term of 15 years, with an initial lease rate to East Lake of 7% on our total investment with escalators of 3.5% in years two through four, and 3% annually thereafter.\nIn conjunction with the lease, East Lake acquired a purchase option on the properties as a whole, exercisable beginning in year six of the lease. The option will be based on our initial acquisition cost, our funding of capital improvements and expansions, other additional funding that may then be in place, or further rent escalations during the remaining duration of the option window.\nEnsign Group\nOn April 1, 2016, we purchased eight skilled nursing facilities totaling 931 beds in Texas for $118,500,000 in cash. The facilities were owned and operated by NHI's existing tenant, Legend Healthcare ( Legend\u201d), and we accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition. Concurrent with the acquisition, we amended in-place leases covering the nine other skilled nursing facilities we leased to Legend, extending their provisions to the new facilities. The amendment also replaced purchase options that provided for equal sharing of any appreciation in value, within a specified range, with purchase options having a price determined at fair value, exercisable at the end of the lease term. Based on our analysis of the in-place rights, benefits and obligations, approximately $6,400,000 of the consideration in the acquisition from Legend was allocated to canceled provisions related to the in-place leases.\nLegend elected to transition its skilled nursing operations to a new operator on May 1, 2016, and NHI entered into a new 15-year master lease with affiliates of The Ensign Group, Inc. ( Ensign\u201d NASDAQ: ENSG) on 15 of the former Legend facilities for an initial annual amount of $17,750,000, plus an annual escalator based on inflation. NHI's total original investment in the 15 facilities leased to Ensign is approximately $211,000,000. The lease has two 5-year renewal options. Upon entering the new lease, NHI agreed to sell two existing skilled nursing facilities previously under lease to Legend in Texas totaling 245 beds to Ensign for $24,600,000. The Ensign lease, secured in part by the operator's corporate guaranty, replaces the amended Legend lease, and, accordingly, the rights, benefits and obligations held by Legend have terminated.\nAs part of this transaction, NHI is committed to purchase, from a developer, four new skilled nursing facilities in Texas for $56,000,000 which are leased to Legend and subleased to Ensign. The purchase window for the first facility is open through February 2017. The other three facilities are under construction by the developer.\nMarathon/Village Concepts\nOn January 15, 2016, we acquired a 98-unit independent living community in Chehalis, Washington, for $9,463,000 in cash inclusive of closing costs of $213,000 plus an additional commitment to fund $350,000 in specified capital improvements. We leased the facility to a partnership between Marathon Development and Village Concepts Retirement Communities for an initial lease term of 15 years. The lease provides for an initial annual lease rate of 7.25% plus annual escalators. Because the facility was owner-occupied, the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nReal Estate and Mortgage Write-downs\nOur borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to other health care providers. Governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower, or at least slow, the growth in payments to health care providers. Furthermore, the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly during this same period. Since inception, a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have undergone bankruptcy. Others have\nbeen forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or, for certain periods, have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us.\nWe believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral. However, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts. In recording the transition of our leases from Legend to Ensign in May 2016, we wrote off the $6,400,000 fair value assigned to the former Legend leases and $8,326,000 of accumulated straight-line rent receivable. Another $1,131,000 of accumulated straight-line receivables were written off in the preparation for transition to a new tenant in in the 126-unit portfolio mentioned under Other Portfolio Activity\u201d below.\nThe above write-offs have been classified among operating expenses as Loan and realty losses (recoveries)\u201d in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The losses are non-cash, transactional in nature, and relate to accounting conventions governing the recording of leases when a new lessee replaces a former lessee. Because these items may create some difficulty in comparing the current period to similar prior periods, we have adjusted their effect in our presentation of normalized non-GAAP financial measures.\nPotential Effects of Medicare Reimbursement\nOur tenants who operate SNFs receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare (federal) and Medicaid (states). Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to skilled nursing facilities could have a material impact on the operators' liquidity and financial condition. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) released a rule outlining a 1.6% increase in their Medicare reimbursement for fiscal year 2017 beginning on October 1, 2016. We currently estimate that our borrowers and lessees will be able to withstand this nominal Medicare increase due to their credit quality, profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios, although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect that similar Medicare increases on an annual basis would have on each of our borrowers and lessees. According to industry studies, state Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation. Federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to SNFs. Any near-term acquisitions of skilled nursing facilities are planned on a selective basis, with emphasis on operator quality and newer construction.\nOther Portfolio Activity\nOur leases are typically structured as triple net leases\u201d on single-tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. As such, there may be reporting periods in which we experience few, if any, lease renewals or expirations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not have any renewing or expiring leases.\nIn October 2016, as a result of material noncompliance with lease terms, we began exploratory measures to effect either transitioning the lease of a 126-unit assisted living portfolio from the current tenant or the marketing of the underlying properties. Either of these courses of action result in recording a reserve, for accounting purposes, at December 31, 2016, of $1,131,000 related to straight-line rent receivables and cessation of straight-line rent recognition. While straight-line receivables represent the effects of recognizing past and future escalations under terms of the lease using the straight-line method, we anticipate full recovery of all amounts billed to date under the lease. We have made no provision for any legal or other costs associated with the transition, as these amounts are neither estimable nor, in the opinion of management, material to our financial position or results of operations. Of our total revenues, $2,411,000, $2,497,000 and $2,604,000 were recognized as rental income from the portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn January 2016 we received full payment from an affiliate of our current lessee, Discovery Senior Living, on a $2,500,000 second mortgage loan we originally provided in October 2013 for the construction of a senior housing community in Naples, Florida. In November 2016 two mortgage loans on SNF properties in Virginia, carrying a total balance of $4,685,000, were paid in full.\nMost of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income with fixed contractual escalations is ordinarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in 2017, we are engaged in preliminary negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity. A summary of these tenant options to purchase senior housing communities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities is presented below:\n\nWhen present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation.\nTimber Ridge\nIn February 2015, we entered into an agreement to lend up to $154,500,000 to LCS-Westminster Partnership III LLP ( LCS-WP\u201d), an affiliate of Life Care Services ( LCS\u201d). The loan agreement conveys a mortgage interest and will facilitate the construction of Phase II of Timber Ridge at Talus ( Timber Ridge\u201d), a Type-A Continuing Care Retirement Community in Issaquah, WA managed by LCS.\nThe loan takes the form of two notes under a master credit agreement. The senior note ( Note A\u201d) totals $60,000,000 at a 6.75% interest rate with 10 basis-point escalators after year three, and has a term of 10 years. We have funded $42,944,000 of Note A as of December 31, 2016. Note A is interest-only and is locked to prepayment for three years. After year three, the prepayment penalty starts at 5% and declines 1% per year. The second note ( Note B\u201d) is a construction loan for up to $94,500,000 at an annual interest rate of 8% and a five-year maturity and was fully funded as of December 31, 2016. We expect substantial repayment with new resident entrance fees from the opening of Phase II in October, 2016. Repayment of Note B amounted to $61,289,000 as of December 31, 2016, plus an additional $7,304,000 through February 15, 2017.\nNHI has a purchase option on the entire Timber Ridge property for the greater of fair market value or $115,000,000 during a purchase option window of 120 days that will contingently open in year five or upon earlier stabilization of the development, as defined. The current basis of our investment in Timber Ridge loans, net of unamortized commitment fees, is $75,112,000, but we are obligated to complete the funding of Note A up to $60,000,000.\nResults of Operations\nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are described below (in thousands):\n\nFinancial highlights of the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015 were as follows:\n \u2022 Rental income increased $17,946,000, or 8.4%, primarily as a result of new investments funded in 2015 and 2016. The increase in rental income included a $2,425,000 decrease in straight-line rent adjustments. Generally accepted accounting principles require rental income to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease to give effect to scheduled rent escalators that are determinable at lease inception. Generally, future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \n \u2022 Interest income from mortgage and other notes increased $3,599,000 primarily due to advances made on our mortgage and construction loan commitment to the Timber Ridge entrance fee community as described in Investment Highlights, partially offset by lower interest income from notes paid off during 2016. We expect total interest income from our loan portfolio to decrease as repayments of our $94,500,000 construction loan to Timber Ridge began in October 2016 and we expect the loan to be substantially repaid during 2017. Repayments amounted to $61,289,000 as of December 31, 2016, plus an additional $7,304,000 through February 15, 2017. \n \u2022 Interest income from our loan portfolio is also subject to decrease due to normal maturities, scheduled principal amortization and early payoffs of individual loans. \n \u2022 Investment income decreased primarily due to our decision to sell 1,043,800 shares of LTC, Inc. common stock. \n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $6,402,000 primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. \n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts, increased $5,479,000 primarily as a result of the timing and amount of new borrowings and our strategic focus to refinance short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility at variable interest rates with long-term debt at fixed rates. This strategy helps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and locks in the investment spread between our lease revenue and our cost of debt capital. \n \u2022 Loan and realty losses of $15,856,000 relate to non-cash transactional write-offs involving the acquisition of eight skilled nursing facilities from Legend and transition of a total of 15 SNF leases to Ensign in the second quarter of 2016, and the non-cash write-off of straight-line rent receivable during the third quarter of 2016 resulting from a tenant's material non-compliance with our lease terms and our planned transition to another tenant or to market the properties. \n \u2022 The loss from equity method investee of $1,214,000 reflects our pro rata portion of the investee's net loss for 2016 as described earlier in our discussion of our joint venture with a Bickford affiliate which was terminated on September 30, 2016. \n \u2022 Investment and other gains includes $29,673,000 from the sale of marketable securities, $2,805,000 from the sale of two Texas skilled nursing facilities in May 2016, $1,654,000 from the sale of an Idaho skilled nursing facility in March 2016, $123,000 from the sale of a vacant land parcel in Alabama and $1,657,000 recorded as a gain on the sale of our 85% non-controlling interest in OpCo. \nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are described below (in thousands):\n\nFinancial highlights of the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 Rental income increased $48,168,000 due primarily to our SLC acquisition in December 2014 and other real estate investments completed during 2014 and 2015. During 2015 we completed $155,575,000 of new real estate investments. During 2014, we completed $555,453,000 of new real estate investments. The increase in rental income included an $8,159,000 increase in straight-line rent adjustments. Generally accepted accounting principles require rental income to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease to give effect to scheduled rent escalators. Future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \n \u2022 Interest income from mortgage and other notes increased $2,965,000 primarily due to borrowings of $83,411,000 on our new loan commitment to the Timber Ridge entrance fee community as described in Investment Highlights. We expect total interest income from our loan portfolio to increase as we continue to fund these loans to Timber Ridge on a monthly basis throughout 2016. Repayment of our construction loan of $94,500,000 to Timber Ridge began during October 2016. Interest income from our loan portfolio is subject to decrease due to normal maturities, scheduled principal amortization and early payoffs of individual loans. \n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $15,085,000 compared to the prior year primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2014 and 2015. \n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts, increased $13,402,000 primarily as a result of the timing and amount of new borrowings and our strategic focus to refinance short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility at variable interest rates with long-term debt at fixed rates. This strategy helps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and locks in the investment spread between our lease revenue and our cost of debt capital. \n \u2022 Dues, marketing and professional fees have increased as a result of (a) marketing and promotional expenses incurred as NHI continues to participate actively in industry groups and in expanding its awareness among owners and operators in the asset classes in which it makes investments and (b) the professional fees associated with the volume of new investments and new financing arrangements during 2015. \n \u2022 We received $491,000 as a secured creditor in the final settlement of a bankruptcy proceeding involving one of our former borrowers. The loan had previously been written off. We recorded the receipt as a loan recovery. \n \u2022 The loss from equity method investee of $1,767,000 reflects our pro rata portion of the investee's net loss for 2015 as described earlier in our discussion of our joint venture with Sycamore Street. \n \u2022 Investment and other gains for 2015 represent gains of $23,529,000 on the sales of marketable securities and a gain of $1,126,000 on the sale of two properties to our tenant Fundamental. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur primary sources of cash include rent payments, principal and interest payments on mortgage and other notes receivable, interest and dividends received on our marketable securities, proceeds from the sales of real property, net proceeds from offerings of equity securities and borrowings from our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash include debt service payments (both principal and interest), new investments in real estate and notes, dividend distributions to our shareholders and general corporate overhead.\nThese sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (dollars in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased primarily as a result of the collection of lease and interest payments on new real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased primarily due to $486,788,000 of investments in real estate and notes which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable, sales of marketable securities and certain real estate assets.\nFinancing Activities - The change in net cash related to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily the result of borrowings on our revolving credit facility, $75,000,000 in unsecured debt from a private placement lender and $104,190,000 in proceeds from stock issuances. These capital sources were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders which increased $13,646,000 over the same period in 2015 due to a 5.9% increase in our per share dividend and the issuance of additional common shares during 2016.\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2016, our liquidity was strong, with $396,832,000 available in cash and borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nOur ATM program, discussed below, and our investment in marketable securities, carried at fair value of approximately $11,745,000 at December 31, 2016, represent additional sources of liquidity. Traditionally, debt financing and cash resulting from operating and financing activities, which are derived from proceeds of lease and mortgage collections, loan payoffs and the recovery of previous write-downs, have been used to satisfy our operational and investing needs and to provide a return to our shareholders. Those operational and investing needs reflect the resources necessary to maintain and cultivate our funding sources and have generally fallen into three categories: debt service, REIT operating expenses, and new real estate investments.\nIn June 2015, we entered into an amended $800,000,000 senior unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. The facility can be expanded, subject to certain conditions, up to an additional $250,000,000. The amended credit facility provides for: (1) a $550,000,000 revolving credit facility that matures in June 2020 (inclusive of an embedded 1-year extension option) with interest at 150 basis points over 30-day LIBOR (77 bps at December 31, 2016); (2) an existing $130,000,000 term loan that matures in June 2020 with interest at 175 basis points over LIBOR of which interest of 3.91% is fixed with an interest rate swap agreement; and (3) two existing term loans which also remain in place totaling $120,000,000, maturing in June 2020 and bearing interest at 175 basis points over LIBOR,with a notional amount of $40,000,000 being fixed at 3.29% until 2019 and $80,000,000 being fixed at 3.86% until 2020.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $392,000,000 available to draw on the revolving portion of the credit facility. The unused commitment fee is 40 basis points per annum. The unsecured credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios within limits set by our creditors. To date, these ratios, which are calculated quarterly, have been within the limits required by the credit facility agreements.\nWe began liquidating our position in LTC Properties, Inc. ( LTC\u201d) common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, we sold 1,043,800 shares in a further reduction of our LTC holdings, realizing net proceeds of $49,022,000 from these sales. In addition, we realized $17,048,000 in proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities held at amortized cost. A taxable gain of approximately $29,673,000 resulting therefrom is expected to be adequately offset by depreciation and other deductions in the calculation of our REIT taxable income, making all of the proceeds available for deployment. We held 250,000 shares of LTC common shares as of December 31, 2016.\nIn June 2016, we completed an at-the market ( ATM\u201d) equity offering. With a weighted average price for shares sold of $71.30, we issued 714,666 common shares resulting in net proceeds of $50,189,000, which we used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We sold additional shares under our ATM program beginning in August 2016 to provide ratable equity funding for our third quarter investments and in anticipation of our Evergreen acquisition announced November 3, 2016. We obtained an weighted average price for shares sold of $80.51, in issuing 680,976 common shares, resulting in net proceeds of $54,001,000.\nThe use of funds from our ATM and the sales of LTC common stock effected a rebalancing of our leverage in response to our year-to-date acquisitions and keeps our options flexible for further expansion. We continue to explore various other funding sources including bank term loans, convertible debt, traditional equity placement, unsecured bonds and senior notes, debt private placement and secured government agency financing. We view our ATM program as an effective way to match-fund our smaller acquisitions by exercising control over the timing and size of transactions and achieving a more favorable cost of capital as compared to larger follow-on offerings.\nWe expect that borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on term loans, liquidation of our marketable securities and our ATM program will allow us to continue to make real estate investments during 2017.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit facility. The ATM offerings have been made pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated February 17, 2015 and a related prospectus dated March 18, 2014, which constitute a part of NHI's effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect to file a new registration statement and commence a new ATM program in first quarter 2017.\nTo mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk, we have entered into the following interest rate swap contracts on three of our term loans as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d), and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, which is reported in current period earnings as interest expense, was not significant for the three years ended December 31, 2016.\nWe periodically refinance the borrowings on our revolving credit facility through the ATM and longer-term debt instruments. We consider secured debt from U.S. Govt. agencies, including HUD, private placements of unsecured debt, and public offerings of debt and equity. We anticipate that our historically low cost of debt capital will rise in the near to mid-term, as the federal government continues its upward transitioning of the Federal funds rate.\nIf we modify or replace existing debt, we would incur debt issuance costs. These fees would be subject to amortization over the term of the new debt instrument and may result in the write-off of fees associated with debt which has been replaced or modified. Sustaining long-term dividend growth will require that we consider all forms of capital mentioned above, with the goal of maintaining a low-leverage balance sheet as mitigation against potential adverse changes in the business of our tenants and borrowers.\nWe intend to comply with REIT dividend requirements that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2016 and thereafter. Dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following January and are, with some exceptions, treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended\nas provided in IRS Code Sec. 857(b)(8). We declare special dividends when we compute our REIT taxable income in an amount that exceeds our regular dividends for the fiscal year.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no outstanding guarantees. For additional information on our letter of credit with Sycamore, an affiliate of Bickford, see our discussion in this section under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities below. Our loans to LCS-WP and our lease with East Lake represent variable interests in those enterprises. However, because we do not control these entities, nor do we have any role in their day-to-day management, we are not their primary beneficiary. Except as discussed below under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities, we have no further material obligations arising from our transactions with these entities, and we believe our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2016, due to this involvement would be limited to our contractual commitments and contingent liabilities and the amount of our current investments with them, as detailed further in Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2014 we issued $200,000,000 of convertible bonds, the conversion feature being intended to broaden the Company's credit profile and as a means to obtain a more favorable coupon rate. For this feature we calculate the dilutive effect using market prices prevailing over the reporting period. Because the dilution calculation is market-driven, and per share guidance we provide is based on diluted amounts, the theoretical effects of the conversion feature result in per share unpredictability.\nAdditional disclosure requirements also give widely ranging results depending on market price variability. The bonds will be freely convertible in the last six months of their contractual life, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020; however, generally accepted accounting principles require us to periodically report the amount by which the bonds' convertible value exceeds their principal amount, without regard to the current availability of the conversion feature. Further, the mechanics of the calculation require the use of an end-of-period stock price, so that using that amount at December 31, 2016, delivers an excess of $9,137,000, whereas the use of another price point would give a different result.\nThe conversion feature is generally available to the bondholders entering the last six months of the bonds' term but may also become actionable if the market price of NHI's common stock should, for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days within a calendar quarter, sustain a level in excess of 130% of the adjusted conversion price. The bonds are optional net-share settlement\u201d instruments, meaning that NHI has the ability and intent to settle the principal amount of the indebtedness in cash, with possible dilutive share issuances for any excess, at NHI's option. While retaining the option to settle the excess of the bond conversion value over their face amount in cash, management believes that, for a company with a market cap of approximately $3 billion, the potential issuance of approximately $9 million of additional shares (measured as of December 31, 2016) is minimally dilutive.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (in thousands):\n\n1 Interest is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2016. The calculation also includes an unused commitment fee of.40%.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe following tables summarize information as of December 31, 2016 related to our outstanding commitments and contingencies which are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition to smaller ongoing renovation commitments which will be included in the lease base when funded, in 2014 we provided a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit to Senior Living, the maturity of which mirrors the 15-year term of the master lease also dating from 2014. While borrowings are used within the Senior Living portfolio to finance construction projects, including building additional units, up to $5,000,000 of the facility may be used to meet general working-capital needs. In March 2016, we extended two additional mezzanine loans totaling $14,000,000 to affiliates of Senior Living, to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in South Carolina.\nSee Note 4 for full details of our loan commitments. As provided above, loans funded do not include the effects of discounts or commitment fees. We expect to fully fund the Life Care Services Note A during 2017. Funding of the construction note commitment to Bickford is expected to transpire monthly throughout 2017. Our remaining loan commitment to Senior Living Management was funded in January 2017.\n\nOur development commitments are more fully described in Note 2.\nWe are obligated to purchase, from a developer, four new skilled nursing facilities in Texas for $56,000,000 which will be leased to Legend and subleased to Ensign. The purchase window for the first facility is open through February 2017. The other three facilities are under construction by the developer.\nWe have committed $55,000,000 to the development of five senior housing facilities in Illinois and Virginia to be managed by Bickford, each consisting of 60 private-pay assisted living and memory care units. Total costs funded includes land and development costs incurred on the project as of December 31, 2016. One facility opened in July 2016, two opened in October 2016, and two are planned to open in the first half of 2017.\n\nIn connection with our July 2015 lease to East Lake of three senior housing properties, NHI has committed to certain lease inducement payments of $8,000,000 contingent on reaching and maintaining certain metrics, which have been assessed as not probable of payment and which we have not recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. We are unaware of\ncircumstances that would change our initial assessment as to the contingent lease incentives. Not included in the above table is a seller earnout of $750,000, which was recorded on our balance sheet at acquisition in 2014.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a commitment on a letter of credit for the benefit of Sycamore, an affiliate of Bickford, which previously held a minority interest in PropCo. At December 31, 2016, our commitment on the letter of credit totaled $3,930,000. In connection with our funding commitment for the Illinois project discussed among loan commitments above, Bickford may also borrow an additional $2,000,000 upon achieving certain operating performance metrics.\nLitigation\nOur facilities are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Our lessees and borrowers have indemnified, and are obligated to continue to indemnify us, against all liabilities arising from the operation of the facilities, and are further obligated to indemnify us against environmental or title problems affecting the real estate underlying such facilities. While there may be lawsuits pending against certain of the owners and/or lessees of the facilities, management believes that the ultimate resolution of all such pending proceedings will have no material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFFO, AFFO & FAD\nThese supplemental operating performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, our Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nOur FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $(0.06) (1%) over the same period in 2015. Our normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.20 (4%) over the same period in 2015, primarily as the result of our new real estate investments in 2015 and 2016. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment, if applicable, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, recoveries of previous write-downs and the write off of debt issuance costs due to credit facility modifications.\nFFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nOur normalized AFFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.29 (7.1%) over the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized FFO, normalized AFFO excludes the impact of any straight-line rent revenue, amortization of the original issue discount on our convertible senior notes and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nNormalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nOur normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $17,077,000 (10.9%) over the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2015 and 2016. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation. Normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD and is presented for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important supplemental measure because it provides information which we use to evaluate our performance and serves as an indication of our ability to service debt. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions and certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing Adjusted EBITDA for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs. Since others may not use our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, caution should be exercised when comparing our Adjusted EBITDA to that of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to Adjusted EBITDA:\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Properties\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds/Sq.
