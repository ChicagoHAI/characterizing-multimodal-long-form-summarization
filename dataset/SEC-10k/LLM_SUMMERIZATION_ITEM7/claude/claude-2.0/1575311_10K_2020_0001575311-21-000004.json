Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto that appear in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company's future plans of operations, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any document, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nOverview and Background\nBrookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. ( Brookfield DTLA\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended, and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A preferred stock\u201d) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, MPG\u201d). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DTLA Holdings\u201d, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the Manager\u201d). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ( BPY\u201d), an exempted limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda, which in turn is the flagship commercial property entity and the primary vehicle through which Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAM\u201d), a corporation under the Laws of Canada, invests in real estate on a global basis.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA owns and manages six Class A office properties and a retail center, consisting of 7,580,957 rentable square feet in total. Additionally, Brookfield DTLA also has an indirect noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns a multifamily residential development property. All of these properties are located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the LACBD\u201d). The following table sets forth information regarding these properties:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name </td> <td> </td> <td>Property Type </td> <td>Ownership Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank of America Plaza ( BOA Plaza\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Class A office </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo Center-North Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Class A office </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas Company Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Class A office </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td> </td> <td>Class A office </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo Center-South Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Class A office </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>777 Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Class A office </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FIGat7th </td> <td> </td> <td>Retail center </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>755 South Figueroa </td> <td> </td> <td>Multifamily residential (under development) </td> <td>47.8% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrookfield DTLA primarily receives its income from lease income, including tenant reimbursements, generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, revenue from its parking garages. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Organization and Description of Business\u201d for more information regarding the organization and background of Brookfield DTLA.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nPrior to the end of the first quarter of 2020, there was a global outbreak of a new strain of Coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) which prompted government and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Many states, including California where our properties are located, have implemented stay-at-home\u201d restrictions to help combat the spread of COVID-19. The State of California order includes the shutdown of all nonessential services, such as dine-in restaurants, bars, gyms and conference or convention centers, and other businesses not deemed to support critical infrastructure (the Shutdown\u201d). Essential services, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, food banks, convenience stores and delivery restaurants, were allowed to remain open. Consequently, business activities and supply chains were interrupted; travel was disrupted; there has been significant volatility in financial markets, resulting in uncertainty in equity prices, increased interest spreads, and lower interest rates; and local, regional, national and international economic conditions, as well as the labor markets, were adversely impacted.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur properties, which are located in the City of Los Angeles, have been adversely affected as a result of the Shutdown and the preventive measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic. Some of the effects include the following:\n\u2022Higher-risk activities and businesses such as indoor dining, bars, fitness centers and movie theaters are prohibited statewide in California. As a result, our tenants in FIGat7th, which include retail shops, restaurants and a big box gym, are experiencing the most immediate impact of the Shutdown on their businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total lease income and parking revenue from FIGat7th represented approximately 3% of the consolidated total, compared to 4% for the same periods in both 2019 and 2018. Due to the uncertainties posed to our tenants in FIGat7th by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized adjustments of $2.3 million to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable.\n\u2022While our office properties have remained open during the Shutdown, most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the stay-at-home\u201d order was issued and many continue to do so. As of December 31, 2020, most of our office tenants have been current in paying amounts due to us under their leases. However, they could face increased difficulty in meeting their lease obligations if prolonged mitigation efforts and the cost of social distancing modifications materially impact their businesses. Due to the uncertainties posed to our office property tenants by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized adjustments of $6.1 million to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable.\n\u2022Parking net operating income, which represents parking revenue less parking expenses, declined by $12.2 million or 42% from $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the Shutdown that impacted both our office and retail properties.\n\u2022Decline in property values resulting from lower than anticipated revenues due to reduced increases in forecasted rental rates on new or renewal leases, applied credit losses, lower leasing velocity and reductions in projected leasing of available space. While the carrying values of the properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, we estimate the undiscounted cashflows and fair values of the properties as part of our impairment review of investments in real estate. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Significant Accounting Policies-Impairment Review\u201d for further discussion.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe Company received certain rent relief requests for certain periods in 2020 from many of our retail tenants and some of our office tenants as a result of the Shutdown. Some of our tenants have availed themselves of various federal and state relief funds, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, which can be utilized to partially meet rental obligations. While our tenants are required to fulfill their commitments to us under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to carefully consider temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements on a lease-by-lease basis.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the collection percentage as of December 31, 2020 related to the amounts due from our tenants:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property Type </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Second Quarter of 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Third Quarter of 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter of 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Adjusted for rent concessions granted to tenants.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Rents, Deferred Rents and Other Receivables, Net\u201d for a discussion of how we assess the collectibility of amounts due under leases with our tenants.\nAs a result of the impact of the Shutdown, we expect our 2021 revenue and cash flows to be negatively impacted by (1) reduced parking revenue as a result of employees of our office tenants working from home, and closures or limited operations of retail stores and restaurants, (2) lower collections of amounts due under leases with our tenants, and (3) a slowdown in leasing activity for both vacant and expiring space.\nIn addition, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that the Shutdown directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLeasing activity and occupancy level\nLooking back on 2020, the year was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic causing significant uncertainty for most sectors, including the commercial real estate industry. Leasing activity decreased as a result. During 2020, we executed new and renewal leases totaling 414,577 square feet within our portfolio, compared to 695,054 square feet in 2019, a decrease of 40% year over year. Contractual expirations and early terminations of leases totaled 707,209 square feet in 2020, compared to 950,567 square feet in 2019, a decrease of 26% year over year. As a result of the negative net absorption, occupancy decreased from 82.9% in 2019 to 79.1% in 2020. See \"Leasing Activity\" for details.\nFinancing\nDuring 2020, Brookfield DTLA shored up its financial positions with net proceeds from the upsized refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza. In September 2020, Brookfield DTLA closed a $305.0 million interest-only debt secured by EY Plaza. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in October 2025, bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%. Part of the proceeds from this debt was used to pay off the original $265.0 million debt scheduled to mature in November 2020 that previously encumbered the property. See \"Indebtedness\" for details.\nIn February 2021, Brookfield DTLA closed a $465.0 million interest-only debt secured by Gas Company Tower. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in February 2026, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95%. All the proceeds from this debt were used to pay off the original $450.0 million debt that previously encumbered the property and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for details.\nCapital Improvements\nThe atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center was completed during the third quarter of 2020 and the construction of the food vendor spaces is ongoing with anticipated openings starting in 2021, pending any further modifications to COVID-19 mandates affecting retail openings.\nIn response to the Shutdown since the first quarter of 2020, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. Further, expenditures for tenant improvements declined in response to decreased leasing activity in 2020. Accordingly, expenditures for real estate improvements decreased from $148.6 million in 2019 to $78.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $70.2 million or 47% year over year.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nBrookfield DTLA's business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $37.4 million and $34.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover its investing and financing activities without issuing additional debt or equity, resulting in negative cash burn,\u201d and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA's negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future. If Brookfield DTLA's operating cash flows and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nBrookfield DTLA's primary liquidity sources and uses during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nSources:\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities, see Leasing Activity\u201d and Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d ;\n\u2022Proceeds from additional secured debt financings, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Contributions from noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nUses:\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d;\n\u2022Capital expenditures and leasing costs, see Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\u201d;\n\u2022Payments in connection with secured debt, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Distributions to noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCapital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA's properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length and type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.\nBrookfield DTLA expects that capital improvements and leasing activities at its properties will require material amounts of cash for at least several years. According to our 2021 business plan, Brookfield DTLA projects spending approximately $267.5 million over the next five years consisting of $184.1 million for tenant improvements, $71.2 million for leasing costs and $12.2 million for capital expenditures. The expected capital improvements include, but are not limited to, renovations and physical capital upgrades to Brookfield DTLA's properties, elevator modernization, upgrades to emergency generators and replacement of transformers. These projections are estimates and may be subject to changes per future revisions of speculative leasing plans.\nSee Indebtedness\u201d below for more information regarding future advance amounts available as of December 31, 2020 under the loans secured by the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and 777 Tower office properties that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs, including tenant improvements and inducements and leasing commissions, and, in the case of Wells Fargo Center-South Tower, common area improvements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIndebtedness\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our issuances and repayments of debt included the following:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Interest Rate Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date/Term to Maturity (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate as of Effective Date </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuances </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>10/9/2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>10/9/2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average/total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>305,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayments of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable swapped to fixed </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>11/27/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>11/27/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average/total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>3.93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Maturity dates include the effect of extension options that the Company controls.\nN/A Not applicable since the loans were fully repaid as of December 31, 2020.\nAfter repayments of debt, the net proceeds received from our debt issuances amounted to approximately $32.9 million, of which $20.5 million was deposited into a cash account held by the lenders as reserve fund to satisfy various outstanding lease-related obligations (such as free rent or rent abatement, discounted or free parking rent and leasing costs) that existed as of the closing date. The remaining net proceeds of approximately $12.4 million is intended for funding various capital and tenant improvements at the properties.\nThe new $305.0 million loan is comprised of a $275.0 million mortgage loan, a $30.0 million mezzanine loan, each of which bears interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus 2.86% and 6.85%, respectively, requires the payment of interest-only until maturity, and matures initially on October 9, 2022. The mortgage loan can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment fees (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until October 2021 after which the loan may be repaid without prepayment fees. A voluntary prepayment of the mortgage or mezzanine loans requires a simultaneous pro-rata prepayment of all loans encumbering this property. Brookfield DTLA has three options to extend the loans maturity dates for a period of one year each, as long as the maturity date of the mezzanine loan is extended simultaneously with the mortgage loan, and no Event of Default (as defined in the underlying loan agreements) has occurred.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA's debt was comprised of mortgage and mezzanine loans secured by seven properties. A summary of our debt as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Principal\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective\nInterest\nRate </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nTerm to\nMaturity (3) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>908,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable-rate (1) (2) </td> <td>1,340,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total secured debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,249,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 years </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(1)As of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this Report, a future advance amount of $29.2 million is available under the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs (as defined in the underlying loan agreement), including tenant improvements and inducements, leasing commissions, and common area improvements.\n(2)As of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this Report, a future advance amount of $43.6 million is available under the 777 Tower mortgage and mezzanine loans that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs (as defined in the underlying loan agreements), including tenant improvements and inducements, and leasing commissions.\n(3)Includes the effect of extension options that the Company controls, if applicable. As of December 31, 2020, we meet the criteria specified in the loan agreements to extend the loan maturity dates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in the process of refinancing the debt secured by Gas Company Tower totaling $450.0 million prior to its scheduled maturity in August 2021. The refinance was completed on February 5, 2021. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for further details.\nNon-Recourse Carve Out Guarantees\nAll of our secured debt is subject to non-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees that expire upon elimination of the underlying loan obligations. In connection with all of these loans, Brookfield DTLA entered into non-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees, which provide for these otherwise non-recourse loans to become partially or fully recourse against DTLA Holdings, if certain triggering events (as defined in the loan agreements) occur.\nDebt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA was in compliance with all material financial covenants contained in the loan agreements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCertain loan agreements held by Brookfield DTLA contain debt yield and debt service coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA was meeting or exceeding these financial ratios, with the exception of the loans secured by Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and Wells Fargo Center -North Tower that did not meet their respective minimum debt yield ratio. In addition, in June 2020, a cash sweep event was triggered on the loan secured by Gas Company Tower as a certain lease space restriction was not met.\nWells Fargo Center-South Tower -\nPursuant to the terms of the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan agreement, effective September 2020, a cash sweep event commenced as the borrower's debt yield ratio was under the minimum debt yield ratio. While this does not constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, any excess operating cash flows are currently swept to a cash account controlled by the loan administrative agent. Funds within this account shall be applied to the borrower's approved operating expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs; property taxes and insurance; interest and any other amounts due and payable under the loan and interest rate cap contracts; and fees and expenses due to the loan administrative agent.\nWells Fargo Center-North Tower -\nAs of December 31, 2020, the borrower's debt yield ratio was under the minimum debt yield ratio. While this does not constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, following the occurrence of such debt yield event, any excess operating cash flows are to be swept to a cash account controlled by the loan administrative agent. Funds within this account shall be applied to the borrower's approved operating expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs; property taxes and insurance; interest and any other amounts due and payable under the loan and interest rate cap contracts; reserve accounts; and fees and expenses due to the loan administrative agent. The cash sweep has not started as of December 31, 2020.\nGas Company Tower -\nPursuant to the terms of the Gas Company Tower senior mortgage loan agreement, effective June 2020, a cash sweep event commenced upon exercise of lease contraction rights by one of the major tenants. While this is not an Event of Default, all available cash (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) is currently swept to an account managed by the lender. The lender will regularly fund operating expenses based on an approved budget, and the borrower may request the release of additional funds to cover approved leasing costs.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in its cash flows for the periods presented below.\nA summary of changes in Brookfield DTLA's cash flows is as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(58,062) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(127,775) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,600) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon (1) the occupancy level of its portfolio, (2) the rental rates achieved on its leases, (3) the collectibility of rent and other amounts billed to tenants, and (4) changes in working capital. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to decreases in interest payments on secured debt by $16.1 million and operating expenses by $9.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in parking revenue by $11.9 million resulting from the stay-at-home\u201d order implemented since March 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from investing activities are generally impacted by the amount of capital expenditures and tenant improvement activities for its properties. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to decreases in cash outflows for tenant improvements by $53.1 million, attributable to a decline in leasing activity in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was also attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by $16.6 million. In response to the Shutdown since the first quarter of 2020, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. In addition, following the completion of the atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center in the third quarter of 2020, capital expenditures decreased by $14.4 million from $37.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by its loan activity, and contributions from and distributions to its equity holders, if any.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza office property and proceeds from the Series B preferred interest were the main source of cash provided by financing activities. As Brookfield DTLA had excess cash from operating activities generated from properties and upsized loan refinancing secured by EY Plaza, it repurchased $34.2 million of the Series B preferred interest and made distributions of $17.9 million to the Series B preferred interest. In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2019, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by the 777 Tower office property and cash received from the lender for approved leasing costs under the future advance portion of the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan, partially offset by repurchases of and net distributions to the Series B preferred interest, were the primary source of net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Series B preferred interest in Fund II held by DTLA Holdings is effectively senior to the interest in Fund II indirectly held by the Company and has a priority on distributions senior to the equity securities of such subsidiaries held indirectly by the Company and, as a result, effectively rank senior to the Series A preferred stock. The Series B preferred interest in Fund II may limit the amount of funds available to the Company for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. At the time of the merger with MPG, DTLA Holdings made a commitment to contribute up to $260.0 million in cash or property to Fund II, which directly or indirectly owns the Brookfield DTLA properties. To provide future funding for general corporate expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs, effective November 2020, an amendment was made to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Fund II, whereby DTLA Holdings increased the capital contribution commitment to Fund II by $50.0 million to $310.0 million.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\nSee Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows\u201d in Brookfield DTLA's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, 2020 for a discussion of Brookfield DTLA's consolidated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDiscussion of Results of Operations\nThe full extent of the impact of the Shutdown on our business, operations and financial results depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that the Shutdown will have on our tenants, employees, contractors, lenders, suppliers, and vendors; any material effect on these parties could also have a material adverse effect on us. The impact of the Shutdown on our revenue, in particular lease income and parking revenue for 2021 and thereafter, also cannot be determined at present.

See Leasing Activity\u201d for further details of occupancy.\nParking\nParking revenue includes monthly and transient parking income. With non-essential businesses closed and employees working from home, parking revenue decreased accordingly.\nRental Property Operating and Maintenance\nRental property operating and maintenance expense decreased as most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the issuance of the stay-at-home\u201d order in March 2020.\nOther Expenses\nIn 2017, an affiliate of the Company obtained a construction loan of $2.6 million from Wells Fargo Center-North Tower. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company fully reserved the construction loan and interest receivable of $2.5 million and $144 thousand, respectively, as collection was not deemed probable. The related charges are included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, as a result of the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza in September 2020, Brookfield DTLA recognized a realized loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.8 million and a loss on early extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swap contracts of $1.0 million to other expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to decline in weighted average LIBOR rates on our variable-rate debt from 2.16% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 0.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain from Derecognition of Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, Fund II entered into an agreement to contribute and transfer all of its wholly-owned interests in Brookfield DTLA 4050/755 Inc., the indirect property owner of 755 South Figueroa, in exchange for noncontrolling interests in a new joint venture formed with Brookfield DTLA FP IV Holdings LLC, and recognized a $24.8 million gain.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14-Related Party Transactions\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation\nSee Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of Brookfield DTLA's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the following:\n\u2022Principles of consolidation\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Recognition of lease income\n\u2022Impairment of long-lived assets\n\u2022Cost capitalization, depreciation and amortization\n\u2022Monitoring of tenant credit quality\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for the summary of our significant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. In determining whether Brookfield DTLA has a controlling financial interest in an entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of each party as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and Brookfield DTLA is the primary beneficiary.\nA VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nA variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Brookfield DTLA qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nConsideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, Brookfield DTLA's ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the VIE's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all VIEs and, as such, all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships that may be difficult to understand, to make significant judgments, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date.\nIncome Taxes\nBrookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.\nRecognition of Lease Income\nBrookfield DTLA's lease income primarily represents revenue related to agreements for rental of our investments in real estate, subject to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases. All of the leases in which the Company is the lessor are classified as operating leases. The Company's leases do not have guarantees of residual value of the underlying assets.\nThe Company's lease income is comprised of variable payments including fixed and contingent rental payments and tenant recoveries. Fixed contractual payments from the Company's leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. This means that, with respect to a particular lease, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of lease income recognized during the period. Straight-line rental revenue is commenced when the tenant assumes control of the leased premises.\nCertain leases with retail tenants also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenant's sales. Percentage rents are recognized as lease income only after the tenant sales thresholds have been achieved.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nTenant recoveries, including reimbursements of utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, real estate taxes and insurance, and other operating expenses, are recognized as lease income in the period when the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.\nIf the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as tenant inducement, which are included in rents, deferred rents and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The determination of tenant improvement ownership for accounting purpose is subject to significant judgment and is based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\n\u2022whether tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\n\u2022whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent.\nSome of the Company's leases have termination options that allow the tenant to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term under certain circumstances. Termination options generally become effective half way or further into the original lease term and require advance notification from the tenant and payment of a termination fee that reimburses the Company for a portion of the remaining rent under the original lease term and the undepreciated lease inception costs such as commissions, tenant improvements and lease incentives. Termination fees are recognized as lease income at the later of when the tenant has vacated the space or the lease has expired, a fully executed lease termination agreement has been delivered to the Company, the amount of the fee is determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nInvestments in long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, are reviewed for impairment quarterly or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets might not be recoverable, which is referred to as a triggering event\u201d or an impairment indicator.\u201d The carrying amount of long-lived assets to be held and used is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used are assessed by property and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, changes in occupancy, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, rental rates, and other market factors.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWhen conducting the impairment review of our investments in real estate, we assessed the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors that require management to make assumptions and apply judgement. These factors include, but are not limited to, the credit quality of our tenants, available market information, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the asset, and historical and forecasted financial and operating information relating to the property, such as net operating income, occupancy statistics, vacancy projections, renewal percentage, and rent collection rates. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a property are less than its carrying amount, the Company determines the fair value of the property and an impairment loss would be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such property to its fair value.\nCost Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization\nThe Company capitalizes costs associated with capital expenditures and tenant improvements. Capitalization of costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after the capital expenditures and tenant improvement projects are substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, borrowing costs, real estate taxes and insurance are expensed as incurred.\nAmounts capitalized are depreciated or amortized over estimated useful lives determined by management. We depreciate buildings and building improvements based on the estimated useful lives of the asset, and we amortize tenant improvements that are determined to be assets of Brookfield DTLA over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the applicable lease term. All capitalized costs are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method.\nDetermining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires management to exercise significant judgment. Expenditure that meet one or more of the following criteria generally qualify for capitalization:\n\u2022provide benefit in future periods;\n\u2022extend the useful life of the asset beyond our original estimates; and\n\u2022increase the quality of the asset beyond our original estimates.\nMonitoring of Tenant Credit Quality\nDuring the term of each lease, Brookfield DTLA assesses collectibility of lease receivables by monitoring the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants. This involves (i) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (ii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, (iii) monitoring the tenant's payment history and current credit status, and (iv) analyzing current economic trends.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEffects of Inflation\nSubstantially all of Brookfield DTLA's office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. Brookfield DTLA believes that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.\nRecently Issued Accounting Literature\nPlease refer to Item 8.

Many states, including California where our properties are located, have implemented stay-at-home\u201d restrictions to help combat the spread of COVID-19. The State of California order includes the shutdown of all nonessential services, such as dine-in restaurants, bars, gyms and conference or convention centers, and other businesses not deemed to support critical infrastructure (the Shutdown\u201d). Essential services, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, food banks, convenience stores and delivery restaurants, were allowed to remain open. Consequently, business activities and supply chains were interrupted; travel was disrupted; there has been significant volatility in financial markets, resulting in uncertainty in equity prices, increased interest spreads, and lower interest rates; and local, regional, national and international economic conditions, as well as the labor markets, were adversely impacted.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur properties, which are located in the City of Los Angeles, have been adversely affected as a result of the Shutdown and the preventive measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic. Some of the effects include the following:\n\u2022Higher-risk activities and businesses such as indoor dining, bars, fitness centers and movie theaters are prohibited statewide in California. As a result, our tenants in FIGat7th, which include retail shops, restaurants and a big box gym, are experiencing the most immediate impact of the Shutdown on their businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total lease income and parking revenue from FIGat7th represented approximately 3% of the consolidated total, compared to 4% for the same periods in both 2019 and 2018. Due to the uncertainties posed to our tenants in FIGat7th by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized adjustments of $2.3 million to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable.\n\u2022While our office properties have remained open during the Shutdown, most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the stay-at-home\u201d order was issued and many continue to do so. As of December 31, 2020, most of our office tenants have been current in paying amounts due to us under their leases. However, they could face increased difficulty in meeting their lease obligations if prolonged mitigation efforts and the cost of social distancing modifications materially impact their businesses. Due to the uncertainties posed to our office property tenants by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized adjustments of $6.1 million to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable.\n\u2022Parking net operating income, which represents parking revenue less parking expenses, declined by $12.2 million or 42% from $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the Shutdown that impacted both our office and retail properties.\n\u2022Decline in property values resulting from lower than anticipated revenues due to reduced increases in forecasted rental rates on new or renewal leases, applied credit losses, lower leasing velocity and reductions in projected leasing of available space. While the carrying values of the properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, we estimate the undiscounted cashflows and fair values of the properties as part of our impairment review of investments in real estate.

Some of our tenants have availed themselves of various federal and state relief funds, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, which can be utilized to partially meet rental obligations. While our tenants are required to fulfill their commitments to us under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to carefully consider temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements on a lease-by-lease basis.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the collection percentage as of December 31, 2020 related to the amounts due from our tenants:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property Type </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Second Quarter of 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Third Quarter of 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter of 2020\nBillings Collected(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Adjusted for rent concessions granted to tenants.\nSee Item 8.

Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that the Shutdown directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLeasing activity and occupancy level\nLooking back on 2020, the year was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic causing significant uncertainty for most sectors, including the commercial real estate industry. Leasing activity decreased as a result. During 2020, we executed new and renewal leases totaling 414,577 square feet within our portfolio, compared to 695,054 square feet in 2019, a decrease of 40% year over year. Contractual expirations and early terminations of leases totaled 707,209 square feet in 2020, compared to 950,567 square feet in 2019, a decrease of 26% year over year. As a result of the negative net absorption, occupancy decreased from 82.9% in 2019 to 79.1% in 2020. See \"Leasing Activity\" for details.\nFinancing\nDuring 2020, Brookfield DTLA shored up its financial positions with net proceeds from the upsized refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza. In September 2020, Brookfield DTLA closed a $305.0 million interest-only debt secured by EY Plaza. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in October 2025, bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%. Part of the proceeds from this debt was used to pay off the original $265.0 million debt scheduled to mature in November 2020 that previously encumbered the property. See \"Indebtedness\" for details.\nIn February 2021, Brookfield DTLA closed a $465.0 million interest-only debt secured by Gas Company Tower. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in February 2026, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95%. All the proceeds from this debt were used to pay off the original $450.0 million debt that previously encumbered the property and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for details.\nCapital Improvements\nThe atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center was completed during the third quarter of 2020 and the construction of the food vendor spaces is ongoing with anticipated openings starting in 2021, pending any further modifications to COVID-19 mandates affecting retail openings.\nIn response to the Shutdown since the first quarter of 2020, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. Further, expenditures for tenant improvements declined in response to decreased leasing activity in 2020. Accordingly, expenditures for real estate improvements decreased from $148.6 million in 2019 to $78.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $70.2 million or 47% year over year.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nBrookfield DTLA's business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $37.4 million and $34.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover its investing and financing activities without issuing additional debt or equity, resulting in negative cash burn,\u201d and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA's negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future. If Brookfield DTLA's operating cash flows and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nBrookfield DTLA's primary liquidity sources and uses during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nSources:\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities, see Leasing Activity\u201d and Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d ;\n\u2022Proceeds from additional secured debt financings, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Contributions from noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nUses:\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d;\n\u2022Capital expenditures and leasing costs, see Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\u201d;\n\u2022Payments in connection with secured debt, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Distributions to noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCapital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA's properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length and type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.\nBrookfield DTLA expects that capital improvements and leasing activities at its properties will require material amounts of cash for at least several years. According to our 2021 business plan, Brookfield DTLA projects spending approximately $267.5 million over the next five years consisting of $184.1 million for tenant improvements, $71.2 million for leasing costs and $12.2 million for capital expenditures. The expected capital improvements include, but are not limited to, renovations and physical capital upgrades to Brookfield DTLA's properties, elevator modernization, upgrades to emergency generators and replacement of transformers. These projections are estimates and may be subject to changes per future revisions of speculative leasing plans.\nSee Indebtedness\u201d below for more information regarding future advance amounts available as of December 31, 2020 under the loans secured by the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and 777 Tower office properties that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs, including tenant improvements and inducements and leasing commissions, and, in the case of Wells Fargo Center-South Tower, common area improvements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIndebtedness\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our issuances and repayments of debt included the following:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Interest Rate Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date/Term to Maturity (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate as of Effective Date </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuances </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>10/9/2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>10/9/2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average/total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>305,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayments of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable swapped to fixed </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>11/27/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td>Variable </td> <td> </td> <td>9/23/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>11/27/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average/total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>3.93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Maturity dates include the effect of extension options that the Company controls.\nN/A Not applicable since the loans were fully repaid as of December 31, 2020.\nAfter repayments of debt, the net proceeds received from our debt issuances amounted to approximately $32.9 million, of which $20.5 million was deposited into a cash account held by the lenders as reserve fund to satisfy various outstanding lease-related obligations (such as free rent or rent abatement, discounted or free parking rent and leasing costs) that existed as of the closing date. The remaining net proceeds of approximately $12.4 million is intended for funding various capital and tenant improvements at the properties.\nThe new $305.0 million loan is comprised of a $275.0 million mortgage loan, a $30.0 million mezzanine loan, each of which bears interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus 2.86% and 6.85%, respectively, requires the payment of interest-only until maturity, and matures initially on October 9, 2022. The mortgage loan can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment fees (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until October 2021 after which the loan may be repaid without prepayment fees. A voluntary prepayment of the mortgage or mezzanine loans requires a simultaneous pro-rata prepayment of all loans encumbering this property. Brookfield DTLA has three options to extend the loans maturity dates for a period of one year each, as long as the maturity date of the mezzanine loan is extended simultaneously with the mortgage loan, and no Event of Default (as defined in the underlying loan agreements) has occurred.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA's debt was comprised of mortgage and mezzanine loans secured by seven properties.

As of December 31, 2020, we meet the criteria specified in the loan agreements to extend the loan maturity dates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in the process of refinancing the debt secured by Gas Company Tower totaling $450.0 million prior to its scheduled maturity in August 2021. The refinance was completed on February 5, 2021. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for further details.\nNon-Recourse Carve Out Guarantees\nAll of our secured debt is subject to non-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees that expire upon elimination of the underlying loan obligations. In connection with all of these loans, Brookfield DTLA entered into non-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees, which provide for these otherwise non-recourse loans to become partially or fully recourse against DTLA Holdings, if certain triggering events (as defined in the loan agreements) occur.\nDebt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA was in compliance with all material financial covenants contained in the loan agreements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCertain loan agreements held by Brookfield DTLA contain debt yield and debt service coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA was meeting or exceeding these financial ratios, with the exception of the loans secured by Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and Wells Fargo Center -North Tower that did not meet their respective minimum debt yield ratio. In addition, in June 2020, a cash sweep event was triggered on the loan secured by Gas Company Tower as a certain lease space restriction was not met.\nWells Fargo Center-South Tower -\nPursuant to the terms of the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan agreement, effective September 2020, a cash sweep event commenced as the borrower's debt yield ratio was under the minimum debt yield ratio. While this does not constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, any excess operating cash flows are currently swept to a cash account controlled by the loan administrative agent. Funds within this account shall be applied to the borrower's approved operating expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs; property taxes and insurance; interest and any other amounts due and payable under the loan and interest rate cap contracts; and fees and expenses due to the loan administrative agent.\nWells Fargo Center-North Tower -\nAs of December 31, 2020, the borrower's debt yield ratio was under the minimum debt yield ratio. While this does not constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, following the occurrence of such debt yield event, any excess operating cash flows are to be swept to a cash account controlled by the loan administrative agent. Funds within this account shall be applied to the borrower's approved operating expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs; property taxes and insurance; interest and any other amounts due and payable under the loan and interest rate cap contracts; reserve accounts; and fees and expenses due to the loan administrative agent. The cash sweep has not started as of December 31, 2020.\nGas Company Tower -\nPursuant to the terms of the Gas Company Tower senior mortgage loan agreement, effective June 2020, a cash sweep event commenced upon exercise of lease contraction rights by one of the major tenants. While this is not an Event of Default, all available cash (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) is currently swept to an account managed by the lender. The lender will regularly fund operating expenses based on an approved budget, and the borrower may request the release of additional funds to cover approved leasing costs. The cash sweep event ended in February 2021 upon the refinancing and repayment of the Gas Company Tower senior mortgage and mezzanine loans. See Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in its cash flows for the periods presented below.\nA summary of changes in Brookfield DTLA's cash flows is as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(58,062) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(127,775) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,600) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon (1) the occupancy level of its portfolio, (2) the rental rates achieved on its leases, (3) the collectibility of rent and other amounts billed to tenants, and (4) changes in working capital. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to decreases in interest payments on secured debt by $16.1 million and operating expenses by $9.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in parking revenue by $11.9 million resulting from the stay-at-home\u201d order implemented since March 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from investing activities are generally impacted by the amount of capital expenditures and tenant improvement activities for its properties. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to decreases in cash outflows for tenant improvements by $53.1 million, attributable to a decline in leasing activity in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was also attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by $16.6 million. In response to the Shutdown since the first quarter of 2020, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. In addition, following the completion of the atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center in the third quarter of 2020, capital expenditures decreased by $14.4 million from $37.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by its loan activity, and contributions from and distributions to its equity holders, if any.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza office property and proceeds from the Series B preferred interest were the main source of cash provided by financing activities. As Brookfield DTLA had excess cash from operating activities generated from properties and upsized loan refinancing secured by EY Plaza, it repurchased $34.2 million of the Series B preferred interest and made distributions of $17.9 million to the Series B preferred interest. In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2019, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by the 777 Tower office property and cash received from the lender for approved leasing costs under the future advance portion of the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan, partially offset by repurchases of and net distributions to the Series B preferred interest, were the primary source of net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Series B preferred interest in Fund II held by DTLA Holdings is effectively senior to the interest in Fund II indirectly held by the Company and has a priority on distributions senior to the equity securities of such subsidiaries held indirectly by the Company and, as a result, effectively rank senior to the Series A preferred stock. The Series B preferred interest in Fund II may limit the amount of funds available to the Company for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. At the time of the merger with MPG, DTLA Holdings made a commitment to contribute up to $260.0 million in cash or property to Fund II, which directly or indirectly owns the Brookfield DTLA properties. To provide future funding for general corporate expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs, effective November 2020, an amendment was made to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Fund II, whereby DTLA Holdings increased the capital contribution commitment to Fund II by $50.0 million to $310.0 million.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\nSee Part II, Item 7.

In addition, we cannot predict the impact that the Shutdown will have on our tenants, employees, contractors, lenders, suppliers, and vendors; any material effect on these parties could also have a material adverse effect on us. The impact of the Shutdown on our revenue, in particular lease income and parking revenue for 2021 and thereafter, also cannot be determined at present. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with our tenants and government officials and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as potential adverse developments in our business.

See Leasing Activity\u201d for further details of occupancy.\nParking\nParking revenue includes monthly and transient parking income. With non-essential businesses closed and employees working from home, parking revenue decreased accordingly.\nRental Property Operating and Maintenance\nRental property operating and maintenance expense decreased as most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the issuance of the stay-at-home\u201d order in March 2020.\nOther Expenses\nIn 2017, an affiliate of the Company obtained a construction loan of $2.6 million from Wells Fargo Center-North Tower. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company fully reserved the construction loan and interest receivable of $2.5 million and $144 thousand, respectively, as collection was not deemed probable. The related charges are included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, as a result of the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza in September 2020, Brookfield DTLA recognized a realized loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.8 million and a loss on early extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swap contracts of $1.0 million to other expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to decline in weighted average LIBOR rates on our variable-rate debt from 2.16% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 0.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain from Derecognition of Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, Fund II entered into an agreement to contribute and transfer all of its wholly-owned interests in Brookfield DTLA 4050/755 Inc., the indirect property owner of 755 South Figueroa, in exchange for noncontrolling interests in a new joint venture formed with Brookfield DTLA FP IV Holdings LLC, and recognized a $24.8 million gain.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14-Related Party Transactions\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation\nSee Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of Brookfield DTLA's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the following:\n\u2022Principles of consolidation\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Recognition of lease income\n\u2022Impairment of long-lived assets\n\u2022Cost capitalization, depreciation and amortization\n\u2022Monitoring of tenant credit quality\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for the summary of our significant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. In determining whether Brookfield DTLA has a controlling financial interest in an entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of each party as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and Brookfield DTLA is the primary beneficiary.\nA VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nA variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Brookfield DTLA qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nConsideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, Brookfield DTLA's ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the VIE's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all VIEs and, as such, all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships that may be difficult to understand, to make significant judgments, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date.\nIncome Taxes\nBrookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.\nRecognition of Lease Income\nBrookfield DTLA's lease income primarily represents revenue related to agreements for rental of our investments in real estate, subject to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases. All of the leases in which the Company is the lessor are classified as operating leases. The Company's leases do not have guarantees of residual value of the underlying assets.\nThe Company's lease income is comprised of variable payments including fixed and contingent rental payments and tenant recoveries. Fixed contractual payments from the Company's leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. This means that, with respect to a particular lease, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of lease income recognized during the period. Straight-line rental revenue is commenced when the tenant assumes control of the leased premises.\nCertain leases with retail tenants also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenant's sales. Percentage rents are recognized as lease income only after the tenant sales thresholds have been achieved.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nTenant recoveries, including reimbursements of utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, real estate taxes and insurance, and other operating expenses, are recognized as lease income in the period when the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.\nIf the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as tenant inducement, which are included in rents, deferred rents and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The determination of tenant improvement ownership for accounting purpose is subject to significant judgment and is based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\n\u2022whether tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\n\u2022whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent.\nSome of the Company's leases have termination options that allow the tenant to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term under certain circumstances. Termination options generally become effective half way or further into the original lease term and require advance notification from the tenant and payment of a termination fee that reimburses the Company for a portion of the remaining rent under the original lease term and the undepreciated lease inception costs such as commissions, tenant improvements and lease incentives. Termination fees are recognized as lease income at the later of when the tenant has vacated the space or the lease has expired, a fully executed lease termination agreement has been delivered to the Company, the amount of the fee is determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nInvestments in long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, are reviewed for impairment quarterly or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets might not be recoverable, which is referred to as a triggering event\u201d or an impairment indicator.\u201d The carrying amount of long-lived assets to be held and used is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used are assessed by property and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, changes in occupancy, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, rental rates, and other market factors.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWhen conducting the impairment review of our investments in real estate, we assessed the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors that require management to make assumptions and apply judgement. These factors include, but are not limited to, the credit quality of our tenants, available market information, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the asset, and historical and forecasted financial and operating information relating to the property, such as net operating income, occupancy statistics, vacancy projections, renewal percentage, and rent collection rates. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a property are less than its carrying amount, the Company determines the fair value of the property and an impairment loss would be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such property to its fair value.\nCost Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization\nThe Company capitalizes costs associated with capital expenditures and tenant improvements. Capitalization of costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after the capital expenditures and tenant improvement projects are substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, borrowing costs, real estate taxes and insurance are expensed as incurred.\nAmounts capitalized are depreciated or amortized over estimated useful lives determined by management. We depreciate buildings and building improvements based on the estimated useful lives of the asset, and we amortize tenant improvements that are determined to be assets of Brookfield DTLA over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the applicable lease term. All capitalized costs are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method.\nDetermining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires management to exercise significant judgment. Expenditure that meet one or more of the following criteria generally qualify for capitalization:\n\u2022provide benefit in future periods;\n\u2022extend the useful life of the asset beyond our original estimates; and\n\u2022increase the quality of the asset beyond our original estimates.\nMonitoring of Tenant Credit Quality\nDuring the term of each lease, Brookfield DTLA assesses collectibility of lease receivables by monitoring the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants. This involves (i) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (ii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, (iii) monitoring the tenant's payment history and current credit status, and (iv) analyzing current economic trends.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEffects of Inflation\nSubstantially all of Brookfield DTLA's office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. Brookfield DTLA believes that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.\nRecently Issued Accounting Literature\nPlease refer to Item 8.

( Brookfield DTLA\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended, and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A preferred stock\u201d) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, MPG\u201d). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DTLA Holdings\u201d, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the Manager\u201d). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ( BPY\u201d), an exempted limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda, which in turn is the flagship commercial property entity and the primary vehicle through which Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAM\u201d), a corporation under the Laws of Canada, invests in real estate on a global basis.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA owns and manages six Class A office properties and a retail center, consisting of 7,580,957 rentable square feet in total. Additionally, Brookfield DTLA also has an indirect noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns a multifamily residential development property. All of these properties are located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the LACBD\u201d). The following table sets forth information regarding these properties:\n\nBrookfield DTLA primarily receives its income from lease income, including tenant reimbursements, generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, revenue from its parking garages. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Organization and Description of Business\u201d for more information regarding the organization and background of Brookfield DTLA.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nPrior to the end of the first quarter of 2020, there was a global outbreak of a new strain of Coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) which prompted government and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Many states, including California where our properties are located, have implemented stay-at-home\u201d restrictions to help combat the spread of COVID-19. The State of California order includes the shutdown of all nonessential services, such as dine-in restaurants, bars, gyms and conference or convention centers, and other businesses not deemed to support critical infrastructure (the Shutdown\u201d). Essential services, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, food banks, convenience stores and delivery restaurants, were allowed to remain open. Consequently, business activities and supply chains were interrupted; travel was disrupted; there has been significant volatility in financial markets, resulting in uncertainty in equity prices, increased interest spreads, and lower interest rates; and local, regional, national and international economic conditions, as well as the labor markets, were adversely impacted.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur properties, which are located in the City of Los Angeles, have been adversely affected as a result of the Shutdown and the preventive measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic. Some of the effects include the following:\n\u2022Higher-risk activities and businesses such as indoor dining, bars, fitness centers and movie theaters are prohibited statewide in California. As a result, our tenants in FIGat7th, which include retail shops, restaurants and a big box gym, are experiencing the most immediate impact of the Shutdown on their businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total lease income and parking revenue from FIGat7th represented approximately 3% of the consolidated total, compared to 4% for the same periods in both 2019 and 2018. Due to the uncertainties posed to our tenants in FIGat7th by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized adjustments of $2.3 million to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable.\n\u2022While our office properties have remained open during the Shutdown, most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the stay-at-home\u201d order was issued and many continue to do so. As of December 31, 2020, most of our office tenants have been current in paying amounts due to us under their leases. However, they could face increased difficulty in meeting their lease obligations if prolonged mitigation efforts and the cost of social distancing modifications materially impact their businesses. Due to the uncertainties posed to our office property tenants by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized adjustments of $6.1 million to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable.\n\u2022Parking net operating income, which represents parking revenue less parking expenses, declined by $12.2 million or 42% from $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the Shutdown that impacted both our office and retail properties.\n\u2022Decline in property values resulting from lower than anticipated revenues due to reduced increases in forecasted rental rates on new or renewal leases, applied credit losses, lower leasing velocity and reductions in projected leasing of available space. While the carrying values of the properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, we estimate the undiscounted cashflows and fair values of the properties as part of our impairment review of investments in real estate. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Significant Accounting Policies-Impairment Review\u201d for further discussion.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe Company received certain rent relief requests for certain periods in 2020 from many of our retail tenants and some of our office tenants as a result of the Shutdown. Some of our tenants have availed themselves of various federal and state relief funds, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, which can be utilized to partially meet rental obligations. While our tenants are required to fulfill their commitments to us under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to carefully consider temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements on a lease-by-lease basis.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the collection percentage as of December 31, 2020 related to the amounts due from our tenants:\n\n(1)Adjusted for rent concessions granted to tenants.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Rents, Deferred Rents and Other Receivables, Net\u201d for a discussion of how we assess the collectibility of amounts due under leases with our tenants.\nAs a result of the impact of the Shutdown, we expect our 2021 revenue and cash flows to be negatively impacted by (1) reduced parking revenue as a result of employees of our office tenants working from home, and closures or limited operations of retail stores and restaurants, (2) lower collections of amounts due under leases with our tenants, and (3) a slowdown in leasing activity for both vacant and expiring space.\nIn addition, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that the Shutdown directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLeasing activity and occupancy level\nLooking back on 2020, the year was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic causing significant uncertainty for most sectors, including the commercial real estate industry. Leasing activity decreased as a result. During 2020, we executed new and renewal leases totaling 414,577 square feet within our portfolio, compared to 695,054 square feet in 2019, a decrease of 40% year over year. Contractual expirations and early terminations of leases totaled 707,209 square feet in 2020, compared to 950,567 square feet in 2019, a decrease of 26% year over year. As a result of the negative net absorption, occupancy decreased from 82.9% in 2019 to 79.1% in 2020. See \"Leasing Activity\" for details.\nFinancing\nDuring 2020, Brookfield DTLA shored up its financial positions with net proceeds from the upsized refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza. In September 2020, Brookfield DTLA closed a $305.0 million interest-only debt secured by EY Plaza. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in October 2025, bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%. Part of the proceeds from this debt was used to pay off the original $265.0 million debt scheduled to mature in November 2020 that previously encumbered the property. See \"Indebtedness\" for details.\nIn February 2021, Brookfield DTLA closed a $465.0 million interest-only debt secured by Gas Company Tower. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in February 2026, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95%. All the proceeds from this debt were used to pay off the original $450.0 million debt that previously encumbered the property and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for details.\nCapital Improvements\nThe atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center was completed during the third quarter of 2020 and the construction of the food vendor spaces is ongoing with anticipated openings starting in 2021, pending any further modifications to COVID-19 mandates affecting retail openings.\nIn response to the Shutdown since the first quarter of 2020, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. Further, expenditures for tenant improvements declined in response to decreased leasing activity in 2020. Accordingly, expenditures for real estate improvements decreased from $148.6 million in 2019 to $78.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $70.2 million or 47% year over year.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nBrookfield DTLA's business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $37.4 million and $34.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover its investing and financing activities without issuing additional debt or equity, resulting in negative cash burn,\u201d and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA's negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future. If Brookfield DTLA's operating cash flows and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nBrookfield DTLA's primary liquidity sources and uses during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nSources:\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities, see Leasing Activity\u201d and Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d ;\n\u2022Proceeds from additional secured debt financings, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Contributions from noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nUses:\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d;\n\u2022Capital expenditures and leasing costs, see Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\u201d;\n\u2022Payments in connection with secured debt, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Distributions to noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCapital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA's properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length and type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.\nBrookfield DTLA expects that capital improvements and leasing activities at its properties will require material amounts of cash for at least several years. According to our 2021 business plan, Brookfield DTLA projects spending approximately $267.5 million over the next five years consisting of $184.1 million for tenant improvements, $71.2 million for leasing costs and $12.2 million for capital expenditures. The expected capital improvements include, but are not limited to, renovations and physical capital upgrades to Brookfield DTLA's properties, elevator modernization, upgrades to emergency generators and replacement of transformers. These projections are estimates and may be subject to changes per future revisions of speculative leasing plans.\nSee Indebtedness\u201d below for more information regarding future advance amounts available as of December 31, 2020 under the loans secured by the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and 777 Tower office properties that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs, including tenant improvements and inducements and leasing commissions, and, in the case of Wells Fargo Center-South Tower, common area improvements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIndebtedness\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our issuances and repayments of debt included the following:\n\n(1) Maturity dates include the effect of extension options that the Company controls.\nN/A Not applicable since the loans were fully repaid as of December 31, 2020.\nAfter repayments of debt, the net proceeds received from our debt issuances amounted to approximately $32.9 million, of which $20.5 million was deposited into a cash account held by the lenders as reserve fund to satisfy various outstanding lease-related obligations (such as free rent or rent abatement, discounted or free parking rent and leasing costs) that existed as of the closing date. The remaining net proceeds of approximately $12.4 million is intended for funding various capital and tenant improvements at the properties.\nThe new $305.0 million loan is comprised of a $275.0 million mortgage loan, a $30.0 million mezzanine loan, each of which bears interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus 2.86% and 6.85%, respectively, requires the payment of interest-only until maturity, and matures initially on October 9, 2022. The mortgage loan can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment fees (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until October 2021 after which the loan may be repaid without prepayment fees. A voluntary prepayment of the mortgage or mezzanine loans requires a simultaneous pro-rata prepayment of all loans encumbering this property. Brookfield DTLA has three options to extend the loans maturity dates for a period of one year each, as long as the maturity date of the mezzanine loan is extended simultaneously with the mortgage loan, and no Event of Default (as defined in the underlying loan agreements) has occurred.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA's debt was comprised of mortgage and mezzanine loans secured by seven properties. A summary of our debt as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\n\n__________\n(1)As of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this Report, a future advance amount of $29.2 million is available under the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs (as defined in the underlying loan agreement), including tenant improvements and inducements, leasing commissions, and common area improvements.\n(2)As of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this Report, a future advance amount of $43.6 million is available under the 777 Tower mortgage and mezzanine loans that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs (as defined in the underlying loan agreements), including tenant improvements and inducements, and leasing commissions.\n(3)Includes the effect of extension options that the Company controls, if applicable. As of December 31, 2020, we meet the criteria specified in the loan agreements to extend the loan maturity dates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in the process of refinancing the debt secured by Gas Company Tower totaling $450.0 million prior to its scheduled maturity in August 2021. The refinance was completed on February 5, 2021. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for further details.\nNon-Recourse Carve Out Guarantees\nAll of our secured debt is subject to non-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees that expire upon elimination of the underlying loan obligations. In connection with all of these loans, Brookfield DTLA entered into non-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees, which provide for these otherwise non-recourse loans to become partially or fully recourse against DTLA Holdings, if certain triggering events (as defined in the loan agreements) occur.\nDebt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA was in compliance with all material financial covenants contained in the loan agreements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCertain loan agreements held by Brookfield DTLA contain debt yield and debt service coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, Brookfield DTLA was meeting or exceeding these financial ratios, with the exception of the loans secured by Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and Wells Fargo Center -North Tower that did not meet their respective minimum debt yield ratio. In addition, in June 2020, a cash sweep event was triggered on the loan secured by Gas Company Tower as a certain lease space restriction was not met.\nWells Fargo Center-South Tower -\nPursuant to the terms of the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan agreement, effective September 2020, a cash sweep event commenced as the borrower's debt yield ratio was under the minimum debt yield ratio. While this does not constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, any excess operating cash flows are currently swept to a cash account controlled by the loan administrative agent. Funds within this account shall be applied to the borrower's approved operating expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs; property taxes and insurance; interest and any other amounts due and payable under the loan and interest rate cap contracts; and fees and expenses due to the loan administrative agent.\nWells Fargo Center-North Tower -\nAs of December 31, 2020, the borrower's debt yield ratio was under the minimum debt yield ratio. While this does not constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, following the occurrence of such debt yield event, any excess operating cash flows are to be swept to a cash account controlled by the loan administrative agent. Funds within this account shall be applied to the borrower's approved operating expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs; property taxes and insurance; interest and any other amounts due and payable under the loan and interest rate cap contracts; reserve accounts; and fees and expenses due to the loan administrative agent. The cash sweep has not started as of December 31, 2020.\nGas Company Tower -\nPursuant to the terms of the Gas Company Tower senior mortgage loan agreement, effective June 2020, a cash sweep event commenced upon exercise of lease contraction rights by one of the major tenants. While this is not an Event of Default, all available cash (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) is currently swept to an account managed by the lender. The lender will regularly fund operating expenses based on an approved budget, and the borrower may request the release of additional funds to cover approved leasing costs. The cash sweep event ended in February 2021 upon the refinancing and repayment of the Gas Company Tower senior mortgage and mezzanine loans. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for further details.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLeasing Activity\nOccupancy level. The following table summarizes leasing activity at Brookfield DTLA's properties for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\nLease contractual expirations and early terminations. The following table summarizes the large contractual expiries and early terminations at Brookfield DTLA's properties during the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\nDecline in occupancy during the year ended December 31, 2020 was mainly attributable to contractual expirations and early terminations of lease agreements. Leasing volume for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is down significantly and we expect the same trend for the first half of 2021. Many companies have paused anticipated leasing transactions while they re-direct their focus on addressing the impact of the Shutdown on their business, including protecting their employees and managing financial and operating matters. At the same time, we have ongoing interest and lease negotiations with existing tenants on lease renewals/extensions and expansion of space and continued negotiations with prospective tenants on leasing of space.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nRental rates. The following table presents leasing information for executed leases at Brookfield DTLA's properties as of December 31, 2020:\n\n__________\n(1)Annualized rent represents the annualized monthly contractual rent under executed leases as of December 31, 2020. This amount reflects total base rent before any rent abatements as of December 31, 2020. Total abatements for executed leases as of December 31, 2020 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021 are approximately $6.1 million, or $1.02 per leased square foot.\n(2)Annualized rent per rentable square foot represents annualized rent as computed above, divided by leased square feet as of December 31, 2020.\nAverage asking net effective rents in the LACBD were essentially flat during the year ended December 31, 2020. Management believes that on average our current rents approximate market in the LACBD.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of lease expirations at Brookfield DTLA's properties for executed leases as of December 31, 2020, plus currently available space, for future periods. This table assumes that none of our tenants will exercise renewal options or early termination rights, if any, at or prior to their scheduled expirations.\n\n__________\n(1)Annualized rent represents the annualized monthly contractual rent under executed leases as of December 31, 2020. This amount reflects total base rent before any rent abatements as of December 31, 2020. Total abatements for executed leases as of December 31, 2020 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021 are approximately $6.1 million, or $1.02 per leased square foot.\n(2)Current rent per leased square foot represents base rent for executed leases, divided by total leased square feet as of December 31, 2020.\n(3)Rent per leased square foot at expiration represents base rent, including any future rent steps, and thus represents the base rent that will be in place at lease expiration.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDiscussion of Consolidated Cash Flows\nThe following discussion of Brookfield DTLA's cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in its cash flows for the periods presented below.\nA summary of changes in Brookfield DTLA's cash flows is as follows:\n\nOperating Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon (1) the occupancy level of its portfolio, (2) the rental rates achieved on its leases, (3) the collectibility of rent and other amounts billed to tenants, and (4) changes in working capital. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to decreases in interest payments on secured debt by $16.1 million and operating expenses by $9.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in parking revenue by $11.9 million resulting from the stay-at-home\u201d order implemented since March 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from investing activities are generally impacted by the amount of capital expenditures and tenant improvement activities for its properties. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to decreases in cash outflows for tenant improvements by $53.1 million, attributable to a decline in leasing activity in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was also attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by $16.6 million. In response to the Shutdown since the first quarter of 2020, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. In addition, following the completion of the atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center in the third quarter of 2020, capital expenditures decreased by $14.4 million from $37.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by its loan activity, and contributions from and distributions to its equity holders, if any.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza office property and proceeds from the Series B preferred interest were the main source of cash provided by financing activities. As Brookfield DTLA had excess cash from operating activities generated from properties and upsized loan refinancing secured by EY Plaza, it repurchased $34.2 million of the Series B preferred interest and made distributions of $17.9 million to the Series B preferred interest. In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2019, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by the 777 Tower office property and cash received from the lender for approved leasing costs under the future advance portion of the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower mortgage loan, partially offset by repurchases of and net distributions to the Series B preferred interest, were the primary source of net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Series B preferred interest in Fund II held by DTLA Holdings is effectively senior to the interest in Fund II indirectly held by the Company and has a priority on distributions senior to the equity securities of such subsidiaries held indirectly by the Company and, as a result, effectively rank senior to the Series A preferred stock. The Series B preferred interest in Fund II may limit the amount of funds available to the Company for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. At the time of the merger with MPG, DTLA Holdings made a commitment to contribute up to $260.0 million in cash or property to Fund II, which directly or indirectly owns the Brookfield DTLA properties. To provide future funding for general corporate expenses, capital expenditures and leasing costs, effective November 2020, an amendment was made to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Fund II, whereby DTLA Holdings increased the capital contribution commitment to Fund II by $50.0 million to $310.0 million.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\nSee Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows\u201d in Brookfield DTLA's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, 2020 for a discussion of Brookfield DTLA's consolidated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDiscussion of Results of Operations\nThe full extent of the impact of the Shutdown on our business, operations and financial results depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that the Shutdown will have on our tenants, employees, contractors, lenders, suppliers, and vendors; any material effect on these parties could also have a material adverse effect on us. The impact of the Shutdown on our revenue, in particular lease income and parking revenue for 2021 and thereafter, also cannot be determined at present. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with our tenants and government officials and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as potential adverse developments in our business. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that COVID-19 directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Information\n(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLease Income\nLease income decreased largely as a result of a reduction in occupancy and adjustments for credit losses of $8.4 million to reflect the impact of the Shutdown on collectibility. See Leasing Activity\u201d for further details of occupancy.\nParking\nParking revenue includes monthly and transient parking income. With non-essential businesses closed and employees working from home, parking revenue decreased accordingly.\nRental Property Operating and Maintenance\nRental property operating and maintenance expense decreased as most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the issuance of the stay-at-home\u201d order in March 2020.\nOther Expenses\nIn 2017, an affiliate of the Company obtained a construction loan of $2.6 million from Wells Fargo Center-North Tower. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company fully reserved the construction loan and interest receivable of $2.5 million and $144 thousand, respectively, as collection was not deemed probable. The related charges are included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, as a result of the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza in September 2020, Brookfield DTLA recognized a realized loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.8 million and a loss on early extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swap contracts of $1.0 million to other expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to decline in weighted average LIBOR rates on our variable-rate debt from 2.16% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 0.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain from Derecognition of Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, Fund II entered into an agreement to contribute and transfer all of its wholly-owned interests in Brookfield DTLA 4050/755 Inc., the indirect property owner of 755 South Figueroa, in exchange for noncontrolling interests in a new joint venture formed with Brookfield DTLA FP IV Holdings LLC, and recognized a $24.8 million gain.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Subsequent Event\u201d for further details.\n(2)BAM owns a significant interest in a company whose subsidiary is the lender of the $35.0 million mezzanine loan secured by Wells Fargo Center-North Tower, which matures in October 2023. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14-Related Party Transactions.\u201d\n(3)Based on the maturity dates after the impact of extension options that the Company controls, if applicable.\n(4)Interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated based on the maturity dates (after the impact of extension options that the Company controls, if applicable) and contractual interest rates.\n(5)Interest payments on variable-rate debt are calculated based on the maturity dates (after the impact of extension options that the Company controls, if applicable) and the one-month LIBOR rate in place on the debt as of December 31, 2020 plus the contractual spread per the loan agreements. Interest payments due to the related party lender of the loan described in (2) above total $1.8 million for 2021, $1.8 million for 2022, and $1.4 million for 2023.\n(6)Tenant-related commitments include tenant improvements and leasing commissions and are based on executed leases as of December 31, 2020. Tenant-related commitments due to the related party lender of the loan described in (2) above total $0.3 million for 2021.\n(7)Construction-related commitments include amounts due to contractors related to redevelopment projects at Wells Fargo Center based on executed contracts as of December 31, 2020.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14-Related Party Transactions\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation\nSee Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of Brookfield DTLA's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the following:\n\u2022Principles of consolidation\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Recognition of lease income\n\u2022Impairment of long-lived assets\n\u2022Cost capitalization, depreciation and amortization\n\u2022Monitoring of tenant credit quality\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for the summary of our significant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. In determining whether Brookfield DTLA has a controlling financial interest in an entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of each party as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and Brookfield DTLA is the primary beneficiary.\nA VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nA variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Brookfield DTLA qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nConsideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, Brookfield DTLA's ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the VIE's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all VIEs and, as such, all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships that may be difficult to understand, to make significant judgments, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date.\nIncome Taxes\nBrookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.\nRecognition of Lease Income\nBrookfield DTLA's lease income primarily represents revenue related to agreements for rental of our investments in real estate, subject to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases. All of the leases in which the Company is the lessor are classified as operating leases. The Company's leases do not have guarantees of residual value of the underlying assets.\nThe Company's lease income is comprised of variable payments including fixed and contingent rental payments and tenant recoveries. Fixed contractual payments from the Company's leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. This means that, with respect to a particular lease, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of lease income recognized during the period. Straight-line rental revenue is commenced when the tenant assumes control of the leased premises.\nCertain leases with retail tenants also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenant's sales. Percentage rents are recognized as lease income only after the tenant sales thresholds have been achieved.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nTenant recoveries, including reimbursements of utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, real estate taxes and insurance, and other operating expenses, are recognized as lease income in the period when the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.\nIf the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as tenant inducement, which are included in rents, deferred rents and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The determination of tenant improvement ownership for accounting purpose is subject to significant judgment and is based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\n\u2022whether tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\n\u2022whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent.\nSome of the Company's leases have termination options that allow the tenant to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term under certain circumstances. Termination options generally become effective half way or further into the original lease term and require advance notification from the tenant and payment of a termination fee that reimburses the Company for a portion of the remaining rent under the original lease term and the undepreciated lease inception costs such as commissions, tenant improvements and lease incentives. Termination fees are recognized as lease income at the later of when the tenant has vacated the space or the lease has expired, a fully executed lease termination agreement has been delivered to the Company, the amount of the fee is determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nInvestments in long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, are reviewed for impairment quarterly or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets might not be recoverable, which is referred to as a triggering event\u201d or an impairment indicator.\u201d The carrying amount of long-lived assets to be held and used is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used are assessed by property and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, changes in occupancy, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, rental rates, and other market factors.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWhen conducting the impairment review of our investments in real estate, we assessed the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors that require management to make assumptions and apply judgement. These factors include, but are not limited to, the credit quality of our tenants, available market information, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the asset, and historical and forecasted financial and operating information relating to the property, such as net operating income, occupancy statistics, vacancy projections, renewal percentage, and rent collection rates. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a property are less than its carrying amount, the Company determines the fair value of the property and an impairment loss would be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such property to its fair value.\nCost Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization\nThe Company capitalizes costs associated with capital expenditures and tenant improvements. Capitalization of costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after the capital expenditures and tenant improvement projects are substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, borrowing costs, real estate taxes and insurance are expensed as incurred.\nAmounts capitalized are depreciated or amortized over estimated useful lives determined by management. We depreciate buildings and building improvements based on the estimated useful lives of the asset, and we amortize tenant improvements that are determined to be assets of Brookfield DTLA over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the applicable lease term. All capitalized costs are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method.\nDetermining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires management to exercise significant judgment. Expenditure that meet one or more of the following criteria generally qualify for capitalization:\n\u2022provide benefit in future periods;\n\u2022extend the useful life of the asset beyond our original estimates; and\n\u2022increase the quality of the asset beyond our original estimates.\nMonitoring of Tenant Credit Quality\nDuring the term of each lease, Brookfield DTLA assesses collectibility of lease receivables by monitoring the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants. This involves (i) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (ii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, (iii) monitoring the tenant's payment history and current credit status, and (iv) analyzing current economic trends.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEffects of Inflation\nSubstantially all of Brookfield DTLA's office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. Brookfield DTLA believes that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.\nRecently Issued Accounting Literature\nPlease refer to Item 8.

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic and government shutdown orders severely impacted Brookfield DTLA's business in 2020, resulting in lower occupancy, reduced parking revenue, lower rent collections, and a slowdown in leasing activity. This led to a 10% decrease in total revenue and a 136% increase in net loss compared to 2019. \n\n- Total lease income decreased by 7% in 2020 due to lower occupancy and $8.4 million in adjustments for credit losses resulting from the pandemic's impact on tenants. Parking revenue decreased 30% due to reduced occupancy.\n\n- Operating expenses decreased 5% in 2020, mainly due to a 9% decrease in rental property operating costs from lower office occupancy during the shutdown. Interest expense also decreased 16% due to lower LIBOR rates. \n\n- Capital expenditures and leasing costs decreased 47% in 2020 as Brookfield DTLA deferred or cancelled certain projects in response to the pandemic. This led to a 69% decrease in cash used for investing activities compared to 2019.\n\n- Liquidity remained stable with cash increasing slightly to $37.4 million at year-end 2020. Brookfield DTLA refinanced debt on EY Plaza during 2020 to raise additional funds. \n\n- Leasing activity declined in 2020 with lower new leases and renewals. Occupancy decreased from 82.9% to 79.1%. Critical accounting policies focus on principles of consolidation, income taxes, lease accounting, asset impairment, cost capitalization, and tenant credit monitoring."}
