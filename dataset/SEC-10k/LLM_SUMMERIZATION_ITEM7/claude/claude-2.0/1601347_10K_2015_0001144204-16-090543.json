Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section is intended to help potential investors understand the financial performance of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur business consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We have historically conducted our lending operations with a view towards the specific needs of customers in the communities that we serve, measuring our success by customer satisfaction and the extent of our customer relationships, rather than on volume based loan origination. Accordingly, because of the demographics of our market area, we have focused, and expect to continue to focus, on jumbo\u201d loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities and U.S. government agency collateralized mortgage obligations. We historically have relied heavily on certificates of deposit for funding, but we offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts, including IRAs. We utilize advances from the FHLB for asset/liability management purposes, to leverage loan purchases, and, to a much lesser extent, for additional funding for our operations.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, loan servicing income, rental income, gain on sales of securities and loans, debit card income, income from bank-owned life insurance and miscellaneous other income. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance premiums, ATM charges, professional fees, advertising and other operating expenses.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We expect our return on equity to remain relatively low until we are able to fully leverage the capital that we received from our offering in 2014.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have historically operated as a traditional thrift headquartered in Cohasset, Massachusetts. As a traditional thrift, our focus has been, and will continue to be, one- to four-family residential mortgage lending, particularly jumbo\u201d mortgage loans and construction loans for owner occupied properties, in our market area. We made a decision to diversify our lending portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and construction lending in order to increase revenues and manage our interest rate and concentration risk. Because we realized that endeavoring to expand commercial real estate and construction lending placed us in a highly competitive space in our market area, we hired additional experienced commercial lenders who had previously worked in the South Shore and Boston markets to support our expanding commercial real estate and construction activities.\nWhile we were successful in expanding our commercial real estate and construction lending, these lenders also brought knowledge of and experience with a niche of select customers engaged in investing in and renovating residential properties. To satisfy the demands of and enhance our banking relationships with these borrowers, we developed a loan product that consisted of a construction loan for the rehabilitation of existing non-owner occupied properties that automatically converts to a fully-amortizing residential mortgage loan following the construction period. We approve the construction / rehabilitation and the permanent portions of the loan at the time the borrower submits an application, which fixes the interest rate for the borrower at the initial extension of credit, and eliminates the need or reapplication for permanent financing and a second closing.\nThe result of these efforts was an expansion in our non-owner occupied residential portfolio and our portfolio of construction and renovation loans related to non-owner occupied residential properties. The business cycles of these customers naturally led them to engage in larger projects, and we responded by developing multi-family loan products, and related construction and renovation loan products, to offer to these customers. Accordingly, a significant portion of our portfolio consists of high-quality non-owner occupied residential loans, construction loans and multi-family loans, We historically have had a significant construction lending portfolio, and expect this trend to continue into 2016.\nOur principal objective is to distinguish ourselves in our market area by improving our offering of customized and diverse products and superior customer service to customers, maintaining our commitment to community involvement, developing market niches and exploring new lines of business and growth opportunities while adhering to a sound financial plan that provides for strong capital position and profits and asset growth sufficient to allow us to provide for the financial needs of our customers. We believe that our primary competitive advantage is and will continue to be our motivation to create relationships rather than one product\u201d customers, and that the first step in beginning a banking relationship is exhibiting the flexibility to customize products and services, particularly loan products, to meet the specific needs of the customer. We believe that, in our market area, this can be accomplished by working with customers to extend credit, within prudent and conservative guidelines, in situations where characteristics of non-conforming loans may be present, with particular focus on jumbo\u201d loans. We strive to provide friendly, knowledgeable, courteous and professional services as we invite current and potential customers to Discover the Pilgrim Difference.\u201d\nWe recognize that, although we have managed to operate profitably throughout a challenging economic period, modest organic growth in our market area and continued expansion into the customer base in contiguous areas is essential to our continued profitability. We intend to take advantage of the opportunities presented by our market area to expand our operations. Highlights of our current business strategy following the completion of the offering, subject to regulatory approval where applicable and market conditions, are set forth below.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrudently and opportunistically grow our earnings base by leveraging the expertise and contacts of our current lending staff and by hiring additional lending personnel with extensive experience in our market area and in the Boston area. We believe that in order to increase our income and profitability, we must focus on continuing to grow our earnings base, particularly our loan portfolio. We intend to continue to grow our balance sheet through increased originations of one-to four family residential real estate, including conventional non-conforming and jumbo loans, on which we have historically focused. Specifically, we intend to increase our marketing efforts, inside and outside our current market area, foster deposit relationships as we increase core deposits, and develop mortgage products customized to serve the needs of our customer base, including jumbo\u201d loans, non-conforming residential loans, non-owner occupied residential loans and rehabilitation-to-permanent loans. We believe that a significant portion of our loan growth over the past several years was the direct result of relationships between borrowers and experienced lending staff that we hired in connection with our decision to enter into commercial real estate and multi-family lending. We intend to continue to leverage the business relationships of these lenders, and also to hire additional lenders with experience in our market area and the greater Boston area to obtain additional relationships in these communities and to complement our existing staff. To better serve and expand our customer base we intend to develop and continually review a pricing model coupled with customized terms that will attract prospective customers, particularly homeowners and investors in non-owner occupied residential and multi-family property and commercial real estate.\nIncrease our focus on commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied residential and construction lending and continue to expand our niche in non-owner occupied residential and construction lending. Although one- to four-family residential lending has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy, we recognize that, with recent downward trends in interest rates on residential loans, a prudent approach to expanding our origination of a diverse variety of loans is essential to our profitability. We intend to increase our focus on commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, both in our market area and in the greater Boston area, and also expand the portfolio of non-owner occupied residential lending that we have developed in the past several years. In particular, we believe that our continued focus on our rehabilitation-to-permanent loan product will serve to initiate commercial lending relationships that will, over time, increase in size and complexity. Because commercial lending is based on relationships, in the past several years we have hired, and expect to continue to hire, commercial lending officers who we believe either already have strong borrower relationships or have the capability and experience to develop those relationships. We believe that fostering these relationships will allow us to increase our multi-family and commercial real estate lending, as well as related construction lending, as customers who began banking with us in the non-owner occupied residential and construction rehabilitation loan space grow their operations and become involved in larger projects. We also believe that these relationships will, despite increased relationship balances, serve to mitigate risk because these relationships tend to consist of more loans with smaller balances and secured by different properties as compared to commercial real estate loans. The change in the diversification of our loan portfolio is not dependent on the proceeds of the offering.\nAs we have gradually increased our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending, we have been able to rely on the experience of our lenders to develop a culture of diligence with respect to adherence to policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk, and to enhance our lending policies and procedures with respect to these types of lending. Accordingly, we believe that we are positioned, with experienced key members of our lending team and policies and procedures developed to mitigate credit risk as we grow, to develop a significant portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans. Commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and particularly construction loans generally have shorter terms and repricing characteristics than fixed-rate, longer-term, one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We expect that a disciplined approach to increasing our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending will diversify and increase the yield on our loan portfolio. In addition, because we will focus on providing excellent customer service and fostering relationship banking with respect to these loans in our market area and nearby Boston, we expect that an increase in lending will result in a corresponding increase in our customer base for deposits and other services.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContinue to expand our traditional originations of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, customize non-conforming and jumbo mortgage loans to suit the needs of our customer base, foster multiple-loan relationships and market our niche non-owner occupied rehabilitation-to-permanent loans. Although we believe that we must increase non-residential lending in order to grow, increase profitability and diversify our portfolio, we also recognize that we have developed our reputation in our market area based on a tradition of conventional residential real estate mortgage lending. We believe that one- to four-family lending is essential to maintaining customer relations and our status as a community-oriented bank, and also creates invaluable ties to the communities that we serve. While expanding our conventional mortgage activities in our market area and in nearby Boston is important to our growth as well as our asset/liability and interest rate risk management, we recognize that, in order to fully serve the customers in our market area, we must increase our originations of jumbo\u201d loans, loans where one or more characteristics of non-conforming loans, such as high debt-to-income ratios, are present but mitigated by other factors such as low loan-to-value ratios, and our niche rehabilitation-to-permanent loans in order to meet the needs of customers in our market area, subject to prudent credit risk management and underwriting policies. We also believe that retention and servicing of the loans that we originate, particularly residential mortgage loans, is important to maintaining our status as a community-focused institution and preserving customer relationships. Accordingly, we intend to continue to retain in our portfolio the majority of the loans that we originate. We do not originate one- to four-family residential or other loans specifically for resale or rely on the sale of loans to generate noninterest income, and do not intend to do so in the future. However, we recognize that a policy of selling and purchasing select loans will allow us to supplement our interest income and, more importantly, manage interest rate risk. As we have done in the past, we will evaluate opportunities to sell certain long-term fixed-rate one- to four-family loans and to purchase quality residential real estate loans when such activities fulfill our asset/liability, interest rate risk and credit risk needs.\nIncreasing core deposits through aggressive marketing and the offering of new deposit products. Although we have historically depended on certificates of deposits to fund our investment activity and loan originations, as well as supporting our liquidity needs, we also offer checking, NOW, savings and money market deposit accounts, which we refer to as core\u201d deposits. We recognize that we can obtain greater leverage from our deposits by focusing on relationship banking rather than one product\u201d customers that typically invest in certificates of deposits. We market core deposits through the internet, in-branch and local mail, print and radio advertising, as well as programs that link various accounts and services together, minimizing service fees. We intend to pursue increased origination of these low cost deposits, with particular focus on transaction accounts, by implementing pro-active marketing and promotional programs, offering attractive interest rates, and offering competitive products to meet the needs of the demographic groups in our market areas, such as remote deposit capture for business customers, mobile banking, and broadening banking relationships with lending customers, particularly as we expand our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending. We expect to focus on employee training and development with respect to deposit generation, deposit retention and knowledge of our products and services so that our branches become sources of deposit generation. We also believe that the implementation of our strategy to increase relationship-based commercial real estate, multi-family non-owner occupied residential and construction lending and to establish additional product delivery channels and technological services such as electronic and mobile banking applications will serve to increase our core deposits. An increase in transaction deposits and relationship banking will decrease our dependence on certificates of deposit, reduce our interest rate sensitivity, and allow us to continue to utilize FHLB advances primarily for asset/liability management purposes rather than to fund our operations.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContinuing to improve our risk profile by managing our credit risk to maintain a low level of non-performing assets and enhancing our policies and procedures as needed. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success, and that managing credit risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. We have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio, while maintaining strong asset quality and moderate credit risk, using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative, as well as diligent monitoring of the portfolio and loans in non-accrual status and on-going collection efforts. In order to grow and increase the profitability of our loan portfolio, we must originate loans that have higher risks than conventional one- to four-family residential loans, including commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, as well as residential loans where certain characteristics of non-conforming loans are present. However, we believe that continued adherence to our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through our experienced, risk-based approach to lending will serve to mitigate the risks associated with such loans. We are committed to devoting significant resources to maintaining low levels of delinquencies and non-performing assets as we diversify our loan portfolio, and we remain acutely focused on the credit risks associated with these loans because we intend to retain the majority of these loans in our portfolio for an extended time.\nOur strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. Specifically, we have implemented procedures to perform internal reviews of selected loans based on risk features and dollar volume. We have instituted a risk-rating matrix to appropriately identify potential risks and rate loans based on key risk characteristics. Additionally, we have implemented a policy that requires a third-party independent loan review of at least 25% of our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction portfolio, with a focus on new relationships, large dollar volume relationships, and identified problem loans. The loan review policy also requires a third-party review of a sample of loans originated by each loan officer. The third party reviewer provides an initial review of risk-rating conclusions and discusses its findings with management. The report is also presented to the board of directors. Final risk-rating conclusions are based on the third party reviewer's independent research plus information provided by management. During the year ended December 31, 2015, a third party reviewed approximately $52.7 million, or approximately 78.4% of our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loan portfolio. The third party reviewer concurred with our internal risk ratings with respect to loans reviewed in its initial findings, based on dollar amount outstanding. Accordingly, management concluded that our improved internal reviews and risk rating procedures are effective in evaluating our credit risk. We believe that policies and procedures are only effective when implemented and monitored by qualified and dedicated personnel. Accordingly, we created the position of Assistant Vice President-Credit Analyst in 2011 and maintain a staff with experience managing commercial loan administration. We expect to hire additional credit administration and collections personnel as needed to support the planned growth of our loan portfolio. We also intend to continually enhance our loan underwriting, credit administration and collection procedures, and to implement improved credit risk management and asset-liability management techniques, such as portfolio stress testing, portfolio credit analysis, and credit decision monitoring matrices. Finally, we believe that focusing on commercial lending relationships with active management teams or owners and on complete banking relationships (instead of loan only relationships) will also mitigate some of the risks associated with commercial and industrial and consumer lending.\nCredit risk management also applies to our investment philosophy. We continually monitor the investment portfolio for credit risk, with a quarterly formal review by our executive committee and our asset/liability committee, of any issuers that have heightened credit risk factors such as rating agency and analyst downgrades and declines in market valuation. We intend to replace maturing investments in 2016 as determined to be appropriate in accordance with our risk management policies, asset/liability analysis and our funding needs.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our credit risk and asset quality management initiatives have been effective and, as long as we continually review, evaluate and enhance, as necessary, our policies and procedures, will continue to be effective in maintaining low levels of classified, non-performing and delinquent loans.\nDevelop a commercial and industrial loan origination platform in our market area, including developing an SBA loan program. Our primary immediate strategic focus will be to expand one- to four-family residential lending in our market area and increase commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied and construction lending. However, we believe that, because our market area is increasingly becoming home to a variety of small businesses in our communities that serve the residential population, it is important to develop a commercial and industrial loan origination platform as a secondary complimentary source of income in the medium term. We have actively participated as a lender under the SBA Section 504 lending program, and we are approved as a lender for the Section 7a SBA program. To expand commercial and industrial lending, we intend to target small- to mid-sized commercial clients, including retail businesses and medical and other professional practices, as well as construction firms and traditional commercial businesses, located in our market area; develop loan products that will satisfy the needs of small business borrowers in our market area; and expand SBA offerings in all areas of our market area. We believe that the development of a commercial and industrial lending platform will allow us to provide additional products and services to and deepen our banking relationships with our existing and future commercial customers, including customers engaged in commercial real estate, multi-family and construction industries, and the owners and employees of such businesses.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions, regulatory restrictions and other factors. We have adopted a strategic plan to leverage the capital raised in the offering to increase our earnings base, especially the size of our loan portfolio, and therefore our profitability. In addition, growth of earning assets is essential to our future profitability, and we expect to incur expenses related to the implementation of our growth plan, including hiring initiatives, deposit generation campaigns and any future plans for expansion.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe recently enacted JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nManagement views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses and deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $22.5 million, or 12.0%, to $210.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $188.0 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net loans of $26.7 million and an increase in available for sale securities of $4.8 million.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Time Deposits with Other Banks. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $7.6 million or 41.7%, to $10.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $18.3 million at December 31, 2014. During 2015, excess liquidity was redeployed into loans. Time deposits with other banks decreased $1.5 million, or 57.8%, to $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $2.6 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in time deposits with other banks reflected their maturation.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased $26.7 million, or 18.5%, to $170.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $143.8 million at December 31, 2014.

Commercial real estate loans increased $4.4 million, or 25.6%, to $21.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $17.4 million at December 31, 2014, commercial and industrial loans increased $1.0 million, or 31.6%, to $4.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2014, and home equity loans and lines of credit decreased $761,000, or 26.7%, to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $2.9 million at December 31, 2014. The Company originated $72.1 million and purchased $8.6 million of new loans during 2015. Partially offsetting the loan originations and purchases were $37.3 million of loan payoffs and amortizations, $3.5 million of mortgages sold to the FHLB, and $13.1 million of unadvanced funds on 2015 originations.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale increased $4.8 million or 40.7%, to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $11.8 million at December 31, 2014, due to purchases of securities. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity decreased $29,000, or 19.5%, to $120,000 at December 31, 2015 from $149,000 at December 31, 2014 due to payments and a write-down of $3,000. At December 31, 2015, investment securities classified as available-for-sale consisted primarily of debt securities issued by the U.S. government corporations and agencies, debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions, and government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a focus on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2015 increased $46,000, or 2.1%, compared to December 31, 2014 due to normal increases in cash surrender value.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $18.4 million, or 12.2%, to $169.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $151.0 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, demand deposits increased $1.3 million, or 9.4%, to $15.3 million from $14.0 million, NOW account deposits increased $2.0 million, or 10.0%, to $22.3 million from $20.3 million, savings accounts increased $2.5 million, or 14.9%, to $19.8 million from $17.3 million, money market accounts decreased $4.3 million, or 13.1%, to $28.7 million from $33.0 million, while certificates of deposit increased $16.8 million, or 25.2%, to $83.3 million from $66.5 million. Core deposits, which we consider to be our noninterest demand accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts, increased $1.6 million, or 1.9%, to $86.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $84.5 million at December 31, 2014. The growth in certificates of deposit resulted from various promotional campaigns designed to attract new customers to the bank and grow IRA certificate of deposit balances during tax season. In addition, brokered deposits increased $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBorrowings and Other Liabilities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $3.5 million, or 70%, to $8.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $5.0 million at December 31, 2014. Other liabilities, which include interest payable, accruals for employee benefits and medical plans, income taxes payable and normal accruals for expenses, increased $243,000, or 57.4%, to $666,000 at December 31, 2015 from $423,000 at December 31, 2014.\nTotal Stockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $367,000, or 1.2%, to $32.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $31.6 million at December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from $654,000 of net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by $298,000 of shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nGeneral. The Company realized net income of $654,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a net loss of $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by a $725,000 contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation, a $128,000 increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance, and $161,000 of incremental expense associated with being a publicly traded company.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and Dividend Income. On a tax-equivalent basis, total interest and dividend income increased $900,000, or 14.9%, to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest on loans increased $916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher levels of average loans. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $25.9 million to $158.8 million from $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average yield on loans decreased 12 basis points to 4.16% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.28% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of lower yielding, interest-bearing deposits decreased $6.0 million to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The yield on investment securities (on a tax-equivalent basis) decreased 23 basis points to 2.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.27% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The total earning asset yield increased 6 basis points to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $19,000, or 1.8%, to $1.1 million for 2015 from $1.1 million for 2014. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposit accounts was unchanged at $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 0.74% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $790,000, or 0.5%, to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances increased $22,000 to $65,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of FHLB advances increased $4.7 million to $8.6 million for 2015 from $3.9 million for 2014. The cost decreased 33 basis points to 0.76% for 2015 from 1.09% for 2014.\nNet Interest and Dividend Income. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest and dividend income increased $881,000, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from an $900,000 increase in interest income partially offset by a $19,000 increase in interest expense. Average interest-earning assets increased to $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $162.2 million for 2014, and our net interest rate spread increased seven basis points to 3.04% for 2015 from 2.97% for 2014. Our net interest margin improved to 3.19% for 2015 from 3.06% for 2014. The improvement of our interest rate spread and net interest margin was primarily driven by a change in the composition of our interest-earning assets. Average loans increased $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on our analysis of the factors described in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d we recorded a provision for loan losses of $144,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, and no provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $886,000 or 0.52% of total gross loans at December 31, 2015 compared to $743,000, or 0.51% of total gross loans at December 31, 2014. Total non-performing loans were $1.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2014. As a percentage of non-performing loans, the allowance for loan losses was 62.8% at December 31, 2015 compared to 52.4% at December 31, 2014. Total classified loans were $4.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses, which were inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $18,000, or 2.9%, to $597,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline was primarily driven by lower levels of security gains. The net gain on sales and calls of securities was $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $70,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Partially offsetting the decline, gain on sales of loans, net was $64,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased $349,000 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the one-time $725,000 charitable contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation incurred in 2014. Partially offsetting the charitable contribution absence, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $218,000, professional fees increased $63,000 and occupancy expense increased $54,000.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense was $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $66,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate as a percent of pre-tax income was 35.8% and 125.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 was due to the absence of an increase in the valuation allowance resulting from the contribution to the Foundation in 2014. We performed an evaluation of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In making the determination whether a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized, we seek to evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including the possibility of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $129,000, reducing our net deferred tax asset to $496,000 and $410,000, respectively, at those dates. At December 31, 2015, $83,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance relates to uncertainty regarding the utilization of the $725,000 charitable contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation. The deferred tax asset related to the charitable contribution expires during the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $46,000 of our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 related to the $218,000 write-down of our mutual fund investment managed by Shay Financial. As a result of the termination of this mutual fund investment in January 2014, we must generate future capital gains in order to utilize this portion of our deferred tax asset, which expires during the year ending December 31, 2019.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balances and Yields\nThe following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. Tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made because we had tax-free interest-earning assets during the years. All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings.\nOver the past several years, management has implemented an asset/liability strategy to manage, subject to our profitability goals, our interest rate risk. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:\nTable 162: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>originating commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing checking accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>selectively selling the majority of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate and retaining all of the adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that we originate; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>lengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increasing our generation of core deposits to support lending and investment activity; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>investing in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increasing noninterest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our asset/liability committee. This committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a gap analysis\u201d of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities.\nNet Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over a two year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning January 1, 2016 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -400bp, although we believe a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>Rate Shift(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income\nYear 1 Forecast\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year 1 Change\nfrom Level\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+400 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Level </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.91 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.14 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.77 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.25 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>The calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Present Value of Equity Analysis. In order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value of equity at risk ( NPV\u201d) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve in increments of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The board of directors and management review the methodology's measurements on a quarterly basis.\nThe interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management's best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Pilgrim Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>At December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EVE as Percentage of Economic Value of\nAssets(3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Changes in Interest\nRates (basis points)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated EVE(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EVE Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Changes in Basis\nPoints </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,553 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.86 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.93 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,455 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.53 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.36 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,466 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.45 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.91 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>-100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Assumes instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>EVE or Economic Value of Equity at Risk measures the Bank's exposure to equity due to changes in a forecast interest rate environment. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>EVE Ratio represents Economic Value of Equity divided by the economic value of assets which should translate into built in stability for future earnings. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2015, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 6.39% increase in net portfolio value. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 12.45% decrease in net portfolio value.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, we may place greater emphasis on maximizing our net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We believe that the increased net income which may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or re-pricing of our assets and liabilities can, during periods of declining or stable interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify an increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. We believe that our level of interest rate risk is acceptable using this approach.\nWe do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from maturities and calls of securities, maturities of certificate of deposit investments and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 million and $686,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, the purchase of securities and the purchase of time deposits with other banks, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities, proceeds from redemption of time deposits and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $30.5 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased $8.6 million and sold $428,000 in securities held as available-for-sale, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we purchased $3.3 million and sold $3.3 million in securities held as available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of the activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances for 2015 and 2014, and net proceeds from the Conversion in 2014, was $21.5 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a tier 1 leverage capital level of $22.2 million, or 10.9% of average assets, which is above the required level of $10.2 million, or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital of $23.1 million, or 16.2% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of $14.3 million, or 10.0%. Accordingly, Pilgrim Bank was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $5.7 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $18.9 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2015 totaled $45.1 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit.\nWe have not engaged in any other off-balance sheet transactions in the normal course of our lending activities.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section is intended to help potential investors understand the financial performance of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur business consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We have historically conducted our lending operations with a view towards the specific needs of customers in the communities that we serve, measuring our success by customer satisfaction and the extent of our customer relationships, rather than on volume based loan origination. Accordingly, because of the demographics of our market area, we have focused, and expect to continue to focus, on jumbo\u201d loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities and U.S. government agency collateralized mortgage obligations. We historically have relied heavily on certificates of deposit for funding, but we offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts, including IRAs. We utilize advances from the FHLB for asset/liability management purposes, to leverage loan purchases, and, to a much lesser extent, for additional funding for our operations.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, loan servicing income, rental income, gain on sales of securities and loans, debit card income, income from bank-owned life insurance and miscellaneous other income. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance premiums, ATM charges, professional fees, advertising and other operating expenses.\n 51 \nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We expect our return on equity to remain relatively low until we are able to fully leverage the capital that we received from our offering in 2014.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have historically operated as a traditional thrift headquartered in Cohasset, Massachusetts. As a traditional thrift, our focus has been, and will continue to be, one- to four-family residential mortgage lending, particularly jumbo\u201d mortgage loans and construction loans for owner occupied properties, in our market area. We made a decision to diversify our lending portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and construction lending in order to increase revenues and manage our interest rate and concentration risk. Because we realized that endeavoring to expand commercial real estate and construction lending placed us in a highly competitive space in our market area, we hired additional experienced commercial lenders who had previously worked in the South Shore and Boston markets to support our expanding commercial real estate and construction activities.\nWhile we were successful in expanding our commercial real estate and construction lending, these lenders also brought knowledge of and experience with a niche of select customers engaged in investing in and renovating residential properties. To satisfy the demands of and enhance our banking relationships with these borrowers, we developed a loan product that consisted of a construction loan for the rehabilitation of existing non-owner occupied properties that automatically converts to a fully-amortizing residential mortgage loan following the construction period. We approve the construction / rehabilitation and the permanent portions of the loan at the time the borrower submits an application, which fixes the interest rate for the borrower at the initial extension of credit, and eliminates the need or reapplication for permanent financing and a second closing.\nThe result of these efforts was an expansion in our non-owner occupied residential portfolio and our portfolio of construction and renovation loans related to non-owner occupied residential properties. The business cycles of these customers naturally led them to engage in larger projects, and we responded by developing multi-family loan products, and related construction and renovation loan products, to offer to these customers. Accordingly, a significant portion of our portfolio consists of high-quality non-owner occupied residential loans, construction loans and multi-family loans, We historically have had a significant construction lending portfolio, and expect this trend to continue into 2016.\nOur principal objective is to distinguish ourselves in our market area by improving our offering of customized and diverse products and superior customer service to customers, maintaining our commitment to community involvement, developing market niches and exploring new lines of business and growth opportunities while adhering to a sound financial plan that provides for strong capital position and profits and asset growth sufficient to allow us to provide for the financial needs of our customers. We believe that our primary competitive advantage is and will continue to be our motivation to create relationships rather than one product\u201d customers, and that the first step in beginning a banking relationship is exhibiting the flexibility to customize products and services, particularly loan products, to meet the specific needs of the customer. We believe that, in our market area, this can be accomplished by working with customers to extend credit, within prudent and conservative guidelines, in situations where characteristics of non-conforming loans may be present, with particular focus on jumbo\u201d loans. We strive to provide friendly, knowledgeable, courteous and professional services as we invite current and potential customers to Discover the Pilgrim Difference.\u201d\nWe recognize that, although we have managed to operate profitably throughout a challenging economic period, modest organic growth in our market area and continued expansion into the customer base in contiguous areas is essential to our continued profitability. We intend to take advantage of the opportunities presented by our market area to expand our operations. Highlights of our current business strategy following the completion of the offering, subject to regulatory approval where applicable and market conditions, are set forth below.\n 52 \nPrudently and opportunistically grow our earnings base by leveraging the expertise and contacts of our current lending staff and by hiring additional lending personnel with extensive experience in our market area and in the Boston area. We believe that in order to increase our income and profitability, we must focus on continuing to grow our earnings base, particularly our loan portfolio. We intend to continue to grow our balance sheet through increased originations of one-to four family residential real estate, including conventional non-conforming and jumbo loans, on which we have historically focused. Specifically, we intend to increase our marketing efforts, inside and outside our current market area, foster deposit relationships as we increase core deposits, and develop mortgage products customized to serve the needs of our customer base, including jumbo\u201d loans, non-conforming residential loans, non-owner occupied residential loans and rehabilitation-to-permanent loans. We believe that a significant portion of our loan growth over the past several years was the direct result of relationships between borrowers and experienced lending staff that we hired in connection with our decision to enter into commercial real estate and multi-family lending. We intend to continue to leverage the business relationships of these lenders, and also to hire additional lenders with experience in our market area and the greater Boston area to obtain additional relationships in these communities and to complement our existing staff. To better serve and expand our customer base we intend to develop and continually review a pricing model coupled with customized terms that will attract prospective customers, particularly homeowners and investors in non-owner occupied residential and multi-family property and commercial real estate.\nIncrease our focus on commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied residential and construction lending and continue to expand our niche in non-owner occupied residential and construction lending. Although one- to four-family residential lending has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy, we recognize that, with recent downward trends in interest rates on residential loans, a prudent approach to expanding our origination of a diverse variety of loans is essential to our profitability. We intend to increase our focus on commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, both in our market area and in the greater Boston area, and also expand the portfolio of non-owner occupied residential lending that we have developed in the past several years. In particular, we believe that our continued focus on our rehabilitation-to-permanent loan product will serve to initiate commercial lending relationships that will, over time, increase in size and complexity. Because commercial lending is based on relationships, in the past several years we have hired, and expect to continue to hire, commercial lending officers who we believe either already have strong borrower relationships or have the capability and experience to develop those relationships. We believe that fostering these relationships will allow us to increase our multi-family and commercial real estate lending, as well as related construction lending, as customers who began banking with us in the non-owner occupied residential and construction rehabilitation loan space grow their operations and become involved in larger projects. We also believe that these relationships will, despite increased relationship balances, serve to mitigate risk because these relationships tend to consist of more loans with smaller balances and secured by different properties as compared to commercial real estate loans. The change in the diversification of our loan portfolio is not dependent on the proceeds of the offering.\nAs we have gradually increased our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending, we have been able to rely on the experience of our lenders to develop a culture of diligence with respect to adherence to policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk, and to enhance our lending policies and procedures with respect to these types of lending. Accordingly, we believe that we are positioned, with experienced key members of our lending team and policies and procedures developed to mitigate credit risk as we grow, to develop a significant portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans. Commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and particularly construction loans generally have shorter terms and repricing characteristics than fixed-rate, longer-term, one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We expect that a disciplined approach to increasing our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending will diversify and increase the yield on our loan portfolio. In addition, because we will focus on providing excellent customer service and fostering relationship banking with respect to these loans in our market area and nearby Boston, we expect that an increase in lending will result in a corresponding increase in our customer base for deposits and other services.\n 53 \nContinue to expand our traditional originations of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, customize non-conforming and jumbo mortgage loans to suit the needs of our customer base, foster multiple-loan relationships and market our niche non-owner occupied rehabilitation-to-permanent loans. Although we believe that we must increase non-residential lending in order to grow, increase profitability and diversify our portfolio, we also recognize that we have developed our reputation in our market area based on a tradition of conventional residential real estate mortgage lending. We believe that one- to four-family lending is essential to maintaining customer relations and our status as a community-oriented bank, and also creates invaluable ties to the communities that we serve. While expanding our conventional mortgage activities in our market area and in nearby Boston is important to our growth as well as our asset/liability and interest rate risk management, we recognize that, in order to fully serve the customers in our market area, we must increase our originations of jumbo\u201d loans, loans where one or more characteristics of non-conforming loans, such as high debt-to-income ratios, are present but mitigated by other factors such as low loan-to-value ratios, and our niche rehabilitation-to-permanent loans in order to meet the needs of customers in our market area, subject to prudent credit risk management and underwriting policies. We also believe that retention and servicing of the loans that we originate, particularly residential mortgage loans, is important to maintaining our status as a community-focused institution and preserving customer relationships. Accordingly, we intend to continue to retain in our portfolio the majority of the loans that we originate. We do not originate one- to four-family residential or other loans specifically for resale or rely on the sale of loans to generate noninterest income, and do not intend to do so in the future. However, we recognize that a policy of selling and purchasing select loans will allow us to supplement our interest income and, more importantly, manage interest rate risk. As we have done in the past, we will evaluate opportunities to sell certain long-term fixed-rate one- to four-family loans and to purchase quality residential real estate loans when such activities fulfill our asset/liability, interest rate risk and credit risk needs.\nIncreasing core deposits through aggressive marketing and the offering of new deposit products. Although we have historically depended on certificates of deposits to fund our investment activity and loan originations, as well as supporting our liquidity needs, we also offer checking, NOW, savings and money market deposit accounts, which we refer to as core\u201d deposits. We recognize that we can obtain greater leverage from our deposits by focusing on relationship banking rather than one product\u201d customers that typically invest in certificates of deposits. We market core deposits through the internet, in-branch and local mail, print and radio advertising, as well as programs that link various accounts and services together, minimizing service fees. We intend to pursue increased origination of these low cost deposits, with particular focus on transaction accounts, by implementing pro-active marketing and promotional programs, offering attractive interest rates, and offering competitive products to meet the needs of the demographic groups in our market areas, such as remote deposit capture for business customers, mobile banking, and broadening banking relationships with lending customers, particularly as we expand our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending. We expect to focus on employee training and development with respect to deposit generation, deposit retention and knowledge of our products and services so that our branches become sources of deposit generation. We also believe that the implementation of our strategy to increase relationship-based commercial real estate, multi-family non-owner occupied residential and construction lending and to establish additional product delivery channels and technological services such as electronic and mobile banking applications will serve to increase our core deposits. An increase in transaction deposits and relationship banking will decrease our dependence on certificates of deposit, reduce our interest rate sensitivity, and allow us to continue to utilize FHLB advances primarily for asset/liability management purposes rather than to fund our operations.\n 54 \nContinuing to improve our risk profile by managing our credit risk to maintain a low level of non-performing assets and enhancing our policies and procedures as needed. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success, and that managing credit risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. We have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio, while maintaining strong asset quality and moderate credit risk, using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative, as well as diligent monitoring of the portfolio and loans in non-accrual status and on-going collection efforts. In order to grow and increase the profitability of our loan portfolio, we must originate loans that have higher risks than conventional one- to four-family residential loans, including commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, as well as residential loans where certain characteristics of non-conforming loans are present. However, we believe that continued adherence to our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through our experienced, risk-based approach to lending will serve to mitigate the risks associated with such loans. We are committed to devoting significant resources to maintaining low levels of delinquencies and non-performing assets as we diversify our loan portfolio, and we remain acutely focused on the credit risks associated with these loans because we intend to retain the majority of these loans in our portfolio for an extended time.\nOur strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. Specifically, we have implemented procedures to perform internal reviews of selected loans based on risk features and dollar volume. We have instituted a risk-rating matrix to appropriately identify potential risks and rate loans based on key risk characteristics. Additionally, we have implemented a policy that requires a third-party independent loan review of at least 25% of our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction portfolio, with a focus on new relationships, large dollar volume relationships, and identified problem loans. The loan review policy also requires a third-party review of a sample of loans originated by each loan officer. The third party reviewer provides an initial review of risk-rating conclusions and discusses its findings with management. The report is also presented to the board of directors. Final risk-rating conclusions are based on the third party reviewer's independent research plus information provided by management. During the year ended December 31, 2015, a third party reviewed approximately $52.7 million, or approximately 78.4% of our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loan portfolio. The third party reviewer concurred with our internal risk ratings with respect to loans reviewed in its initial findings, based on dollar amount outstanding. Accordingly, management concluded that our improved internal reviews and risk rating procedures are effective in evaluating our credit risk. We believe that policies and procedures are only effective when implemented and monitored by qualified and dedicated personnel. Accordingly, we created the position of Assistant Vice President-Credit Analyst in 2011 and maintain a staff with experience managing commercial loan administration. We expect to hire additional credit administration and collections personnel as needed to support the planned growth of our loan portfolio. We also intend to continually enhance our loan underwriting, credit administration and collection procedures, and to implement improved credit risk management and asset-liability management techniques, such as portfolio stress testing, portfolio credit analysis, and credit decision monitoring matrices. Finally, we believe that focusing on commercial lending relationships with active management teams or owners and on complete banking relationships (instead of loan only relationships) will also mitigate some of the risks associated with commercial and industrial and consumer lending.\nCredit risk management also applies to our investment philosophy. We continually monitor the investment portfolio for credit risk, with a quarterly formal review by our executive committee and our asset/liability committee, of any issuers that have heightened credit risk factors such as rating agency and analyst downgrades and declines in market valuation. We intend to replace maturing investments in 2016 as determined to be appropriate in accordance with our risk management policies, asset/liability analysis and our funding needs.\n 55 \nWe believe that our credit risk and asset quality management initiatives have been effective and, as long as we continually review, evaluate and enhance, as necessary, our policies and procedures, will continue to be effective in maintaining low levels of classified, non-performing and delinquent loans.\nDevelop a commercial and industrial loan origination platform in our market area, including developing an SBA loan program. Our primary immediate strategic focus will be to expand one- to four-family residential lending in our market area and increase commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied and construction lending. However, we believe that, because our market area is increasingly becoming home to a variety of small businesses in our communities that serve the residential population, it is important to develop a commercial and industrial loan origination platform as a secondary complimentary source of income in the medium term. We have actively participated as a lender under the SBA Section 504 lending program, and we are approved as a lender for the Section 7a SBA program. To expand commercial and industrial lending, we intend to target small- to mid-sized commercial clients, including retail businesses and medical and other professional practices, as well as construction firms and traditional commercial businesses, located in our market area; develop loan products that will satisfy the needs of small business borrowers in our market area; and expand SBA offerings in all areas of our market area. We believe that the development of a commercial and industrial lending platform will allow us to provide additional products and services to and deepen our banking relationships with our existing and future commercial customers, including customers engaged in commercial real estate, multi-family and construction industries, and the owners and employees of such businesses.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions, regulatory restrictions and other factors. We have adopted a strategic plan to leverage the capital raised in the offering to increase our earnings base, especially the size of our loan portfolio, and therefore our profitability. In addition, growth of earning assets is essential to our future profitability, and we expect to incur expenses related to the implementation of our growth plan, including hiring initiatives, deposit generation campaigns and any future plans for expansion.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe recently enacted JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nManagement views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses and deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies.\n 56 \nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $22.5 million, or 12.0%, to $210.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $188.0 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net loans of $26.7 million and an increase in available for sale securities of $4.8 million.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Time Deposits with Other Banks. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $7.6 million or 41.7%, to $10.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $18.3 million at December 31, 2014. During 2015, excess liquidity was redeployed into loans. Time deposits with other banks decreased $1.5 million, or 57.8%, to $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $2.6 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in time deposits with other banks reflected their maturation.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased $26.7 million, or 18.5%, to $170.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $143.8 million at December 31, 2014. One-to-four-family residential real estate loans increased $8.4 million, or 8.7%, to $104.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $96.4 million at December 31, 2014, multifamily loans increased $6.4 million, or 62.8%, to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $10.2 million at December 31, 2014, and construction loans increased $6.7 million, or 55.4%, to $18.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $12.1 million at December 31, 2014. Commercial real estate loans increased $4.4 million, or 25.6%, to $21.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $17.4 million at December 31, 2014, commercial and industrial loans increased $1.0 million, or 31.6%, to $4.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2014, and home equity loans and lines of credit decreased $761,000, or 26.7%, to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $2.9 million at December 31, 2014. The Company originated $72.1 million and purchased $8.6 million of new loans during 2015. Partially offsetting the loan originations and purchases were $37.3 million of loan payoffs and amortizations, $3.5 million of mortgages sold to the FHLB, and $13.1 million of unadvanced funds on 2015 originations.\n 57 \nInvestment Securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale increased $4.8 million or 40.7%, to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $11.8 million at December 31, 2014, due to purchases of securities. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity decreased $29,000, or 19.5%, to $120,000 at December 31, 2015 from $149,000 at December 31, 2014 due to payments and a write-down of $3,000. At December 31, 2015, investment securities classified as available-for-sale consisted primarily of debt securities issued by the U.S. government corporations and agencies, debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions, and government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a focus on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2015 increased $46,000, or 2.1%, compared to December 31, 2014 due to normal increases in cash surrender value.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $18.4 million, or 12.2%, to $169.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $151.0 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, demand deposits increased $1.3 million, or 9.4%, to $15.3 million from $14.0 million, NOW account deposits increased $2.0 million, or 10.0%, to $22.3 million from $20.3 million, savings accounts increased $2.5 million, or 14.9%, to $19.8 million from $17.3 million, money market accounts decreased $4.3 million, or 13.1%, to $28.7 million from $33.0 million, while certificates of deposit increased $16.8 million, or 25.2%, to $83.3 million from $66.5 million. Core deposits, which we consider to be our noninterest demand accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts, increased $1.6 million, or 1.9%, to $86.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $84.5 million at December 31, 2014. The growth in certificates of deposit resulted from various promotional campaigns designed to attract new customers to the bank and grow IRA certificate of deposit balances during tax season. In addition, brokered deposits increased $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBorrowings and Other Liabilities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $3.5 million, or 70%, to $8.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $5.0 million at December 31, 2014. Other liabilities, which include interest payable, accruals for employee benefits and medical plans, income taxes payable and normal accruals for expenses, increased $243,000, or 57.4%, to $666,000 at December 31, 2015 from $423,000 at December 31, 2014.\nTotal Stockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $367,000, or 1.2%, to $32.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $31.6 million at December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from $654,000 of net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by $298,000 of shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nGeneral. The Company realized net income of $654,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a net loss of $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by a $725,000 contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation, a $128,000 increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance, and $161,000 of incremental expense associated with being a publicly traded company.\n 58 \nInterest and Dividend Income. On a tax-equivalent basis, total interest and dividend income increased $900,000, or 14.9%, to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest on loans increased $916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher levels of average loans. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $25.9 million to $158.8 million from $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average yield on loans decreased 12 basis points to 4.16% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.28% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of lower yielding, interest-bearing deposits decreased $6.0 million to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The yield on investment securities (on a tax-equivalent basis) decreased 23 basis points to 2.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.27% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The total earning asset yield increased 6 basis points to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $19,000, or 1.8%, to $1.1 million for 2015 from $1.1 million for 2014. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposit accounts was unchanged at $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 0.74% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $790,000, or 0.5%, to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances increased $22,000 to $65,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of FHLB advances increased $4.7 million to $8.6 million for 2015 from $3.9 million for 2014. The cost decreased 33 basis points to 0.76% for 2015 from 1.09% for 2014.\nNet Interest and Dividend Income. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest and dividend income increased $881,000, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from an $900,000 increase in interest income partially offset by a $19,000 increase in interest expense. Average interest-earning assets increased to $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $162.2 million for 2014, and our net interest rate spread increased seven basis points to 3.04% for 2015 from 2.97% for 2014. Our net interest margin improved to 3.19% for 2015 from 3.06% for 2014. The improvement of our interest rate spread and net interest margin was primarily driven by a change in the composition of our interest-earning assets. Average loans increased $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on our analysis of the factors described in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d we recorded a provision for loan losses of $144,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, and no provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $886,000 or 0.52% of total gross loans at December 31, 2015 compared to $743,000, or 0.51% of total gross loans at December 31, 2014. Total non-performing loans were $1.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2014. As a percentage of non-performing loans, the allowance for loan losses was 62.8% at December 31, 2015 compared to 52.4% at December 31, 2014. Total classified loans were $4.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses, which were inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $18,000, or 2.9%, to $597,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline was primarily driven by lower levels of security gains. The net gain on sales and calls of securities was $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $70,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Partially offsetting the decline, gain on sales of loans, net was $64,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n 59 \nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased $349,000 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the one-time $725,000 charitable contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation incurred in 2014. Partially offsetting the charitable contribution absence, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $218,000, professional fees increased $63,000 and occupancy expense increased $54,000.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense was $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $66,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate as a percent of pre-tax income was 35.8% and 125.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 was due to the absence of an increase in the valuation allowance resulting from the contribution to the Foundation in 2014. We performed an evaluation of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In making the determination whether a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized, we seek to evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including the possibility of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $129,000, reducing our net deferred tax asset to $496,000 and $410,000, respectively, at those dates. At December 31, 2015, $83,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance relates to uncertainty regarding the utilization of the $725,000 charitable contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation. The deferred tax asset related to the charitable contribution expires during the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $46,000 of our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 related to the $218,000 write-down of our mutual fund investment managed by Shay Financial. As a result of the termination of this mutual fund investment in January 2014, we must generate future capital gains in order to utilize this portion of our deferred tax asset, which expires during the year ending December 31, 2019.\n 60 \nAverage Balances and Yields\nThe following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. Tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made because we had tax-free interest-earning assets during the years. All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings.\nOver the past several years, management has implemented an asset/liability strategy to manage, subject to our profitability goals, our interest rate risk. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:\n \u00b7 originating commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing checking accounts; \n \u00b7 selectively selling the majority of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate and retaining all of the adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that we originate; \n \u00b7 lengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston; \n \u00b7 increasing our generation of core deposits to support lending and investment activity; \n \u00b7 investing in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and \n 62 \n \u00b7 increasing noninterest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread. \nOur board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our asset/liability committee. This committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a gap analysis\u201d of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities.\nNet Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over a two year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning January 1, 2016 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -400bp, although we believe a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>Rate Shift(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income\nYear 1 Forecast\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year 1 Change\nfrom Level\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+400 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Level </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.91 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.14 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.77 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.25 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve. \nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.\n 63 \nNet Present Value of Equity Analysis. In order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value of equity at risk ( NPV\u201d) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve in increments of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The board of directors and management review the methodology's measurements on a quarterly basis.\nThe interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management's best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Pilgrim Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>At December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EVE as Percentage of Economic Value of\nAssets(3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Changes in Interest\nRates (basis points)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated EVE(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EVE Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Changes in Basis\nPoints </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,553 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.86 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.93 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,455 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.53 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.36 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,466 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.45 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.91 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>-100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Assumes instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates. \n (2) EVE or Economic Value of Equity at Risk measures the Bank's exposure to equity due to changes in a forecast interest rate environment. \n (3) EVE Ratio represents Economic Value of Equity divided by the economic value of assets which should translate into built in stability for future earnings. \nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2015, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 6.39% increase in net portfolio value. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 12.45% decrease in net portfolio value.\n 64 \nDepending on the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, we may place greater emphasis on maximizing our net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We believe that the increased net income which may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or re-pricing of our assets and liabilities can, during periods of declining or stable interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify an increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. We believe that our level of interest rate risk is acceptable using this approach.\nWe do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from maturities and calls of securities, maturities of certificate of deposit investments and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 million and $686,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, the purchase of securities and the purchase of time deposits with other banks, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities, proceeds from redemption of time deposits and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $30.5 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased $8.6 million and sold $428,000 in securities held as available-for-sale, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we purchased $3.3 million and sold $3.3 million in securities held as available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of the activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances for 2015 and 2014, and net proceeds from the Conversion in 2014, was $21.5 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a tier 1 leverage capital level of $22.2 million, or 10.9% of average assets, which is above the required level of $10.2 million, or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital of $23.1 million, or 16.2% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of $14.3 million, or 10.0%. Accordingly, Pilgrim Bank was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $5.7 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $18.9 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2015 totaled $45.1 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\n 65 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit.\nWe have not engaged in any other off-balance sheet transactions in the normal course of our lending activities.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section is intended to help potential investors understand the financial performance of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur business consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We have historically conducted our lending operations with a view towards the specific needs of customers in the communities that we serve, measuring our success by customer satisfaction and the extent of our customer relationships, rather than on volume based loan origination. Accordingly, because of the demographics of our market area, we have focused, and expect to continue to focus, on jumbo\u201d loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities and U.S. government agency collateralized mortgage obligations. We historically have relied heavily on certificates of deposit for funding, but we offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts, including IRAs. We utilize advances from the FHLB for asset/liability management purposes, to leverage loan purchases, and, to a much lesser extent, for additional funding for our operations.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, loan servicing income, rental income, gain on sales of securities and loans, debit card income, income from bank-owned life insurance and miscellaneous other income. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance premiums, ATM charges, professional fees, advertising and other operating expenses.\n 51 \nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We expect our return on equity to remain relatively low until we are able to fully leverage the capital that we received from our offering in 2014.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have historically operated as a traditional thrift headquartered in Cohasset, Massachusetts. As a traditional thrift, our focus has been, and will continue to be, one- to four-family residential mortgage lending, particularly jumbo\u201d mortgage loans and construction loans for owner occupied properties, in our market area. We made a decision to diversify our lending portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and construction lending in order to increase revenues and manage our interest rate and concentration risk. Because we realized that endeavoring to expand commercial real estate and construction lending placed us in a highly competitive space in our market area, we hired additional experienced commercial lenders who had previously worked in the South Shore and Boston markets to support our expanding commercial real estate and construction activities.\nWhile we were successful in expanding our commercial real estate and construction lending, these lenders also brought knowledge of and experience with a niche of select customers engaged in investing in and renovating residential properties. To satisfy the demands of and enhance our banking relationships with these borrowers, we developed a loan product that consisted of a construction loan for the rehabilitation of existing non-owner occupied properties that automatically converts to a fully-amortizing residential mortgage loan following the construction period. We approve the construction / rehabilitation and the permanent portions of the loan at the time the borrower submits an application, which fixes the interest rate for the borrower at the initial extension of credit, and eliminates the need or reapplication for permanent financing and a second closing.\nThe result of these efforts was an expansion in our non-owner occupied residential portfolio and our portfolio of construction and renovation loans related to non-owner occupied residential properties. The business cycles of these customers naturally led them to engage in larger projects, and we responded by developing multi-family loan products, and related construction and renovation loan products, to offer to these customers. Accordingly, a significant portion of our portfolio consists of high-quality non-owner occupied residential loans, construction loans and multi-family loans, We historically have had a significant construction lending portfolio, and expect this trend to continue into 2016.\nOur principal objective is to distinguish ourselves in our market area by improving our offering of customized and diverse products and superior customer service to customers, maintaining our commitment to community involvement, developing market niches and exploring new lines of business and growth opportunities while adhering to a sound financial plan that provides for strong capital position and profits and asset growth sufficient to allow us to provide for the financial needs of our customers. We believe that our primary competitive advantage is and will continue to be our motivation to create relationships rather than one product\u201d customers, and that the first step in beginning a banking relationship is exhibiting the flexibility to customize products and services, particularly loan products, to meet the specific needs of the customer. We believe that, in our market area, this can be accomplished by working with customers to extend credit, within prudent and conservative guidelines, in situations where characteristics of non-conforming loans may be present, with particular focus on jumbo\u201d loans. We strive to provide friendly, knowledgeable, courteous and professional services as we invite current and potential customers to Discover the Pilgrim Difference.\u201d\nWe recognize that, although we have managed to operate profitably throughout a challenging economic period, modest organic growth in our market area and continued expansion into the customer base in contiguous areas is essential to our continued profitability. We intend to take advantage of the opportunities presented by our market area to expand our operations. Highlights of our current business strategy following the completion of the offering, subject to regulatory approval where applicable and market conditions, are set forth below.\n 52 \nPrudently and opportunistically grow our earnings base by leveraging the expertise and contacts of our current lending staff and by hiring additional lending personnel with extensive experience in our market area and in the Boston area. We believe that in order to increase our income and profitability, we must focus on continuing to grow our earnings base, particularly our loan portfolio. We intend to continue to grow our balance sheet through increased originations of one-to four family residential real estate, including conventional non-conforming and jumbo loans, on which we have historically focused. Specifically, we intend to increase our marketing efforts, inside and outside our current market area, foster deposit relationships as we increase core deposits, and develop mortgage products customized to serve the needs of our customer base, including jumbo\u201d loans, non-conforming residential loans, non-owner occupied residential loans and rehabilitation-to-permanent loans. We believe that a significant portion of our loan growth over the past several years was the direct result of relationships between borrowers and experienced lending staff that we hired in connection with our decision to enter into commercial real estate and multi-family lending. We intend to continue to leverage the business relationships of these lenders, and also to hire additional lenders with experience in our market area and the greater Boston area to obtain additional relationships in these communities and to complement our existing staff. To better serve and expand our customer base we intend to develop and continually review a pricing model coupled with customized terms that will attract prospective customers, particularly homeowners and investors in non-owner occupied residential and multi-family property and commercial real estate.\nIncrease our focus on commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied residential and construction lending and continue to expand our niche in non-owner occupied residential and construction lending. Although one- to four-family residential lending has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy, we recognize that, with recent downward trends in interest rates on residential loans, a prudent approach to expanding our origination of a diverse variety of loans is essential to our profitability. We intend to increase our focus on commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, both in our market area and in the greater Boston area, and also expand the portfolio of non-owner occupied residential lending that we have developed in the past several years. In particular, we believe that our continued focus on our rehabilitation-to-permanent loan product will serve to initiate commercial lending relationships that will, over time, increase in size and complexity. Because commercial lending is based on relationships, in the past several years we have hired, and expect to continue to hire, commercial lending officers who we believe either already have strong borrower relationships or have the capability and experience to develop those relationships. We believe that fostering these relationships will allow us to increase our multi-family and commercial real estate lending, as well as related construction lending, as customers who began banking with us in the non-owner occupied residential and construction rehabilitation loan space grow their operations and become involved in larger projects. We also believe that these relationships will, despite increased relationship balances, serve to mitigate risk because these relationships tend to consist of more loans with smaller balances and secured by different properties as compared to commercial real estate loans. The change in the diversification of our loan portfolio is not dependent on the proceeds of the offering.\nAs we have gradually increased our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending, we have been able to rely on the experience of our lenders to develop a culture of diligence with respect to adherence to policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk, and to enhance our lending policies and procedures with respect to these types of lending. Accordingly, we believe that we are positioned, with experienced key members of our lending team and policies and procedures developed to mitigate credit risk as we grow, to develop a significant portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans. Commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and particularly construction loans generally have shorter terms and repricing characteristics than fixed-rate, longer-term, one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We expect that a disciplined approach to increasing our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending will diversify and increase the yield on our loan portfolio. In addition, because we will focus on providing excellent customer service and fostering relationship banking with respect to these loans in our market area and nearby Boston, we expect that an increase in lending will result in a corresponding increase in our customer base for deposits and other services.\n 53 \nContinue to expand our traditional originations of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, customize non-conforming and jumbo mortgage loans to suit the needs of our customer base, foster multiple-loan relationships and market our niche non-owner occupied rehabilitation-to-permanent loans. Although we believe that we must increase non-residential lending in order to grow, increase profitability and diversify our portfolio, we also recognize that we have developed our reputation in our market area based on a tradition of conventional residential real estate mortgage lending. We believe that one- to four-family lending is essential to maintaining customer relations and our status as a community-oriented bank, and also creates invaluable ties to the communities that we serve. While expanding our conventional mortgage activities in our market area and in nearby Boston is important to our growth as well as our asset/liability and interest rate risk management, we recognize that, in order to fully serve the customers in our market area, we must increase our originations of jumbo\u201d loans, loans where one or more characteristics of non-conforming loans, such as high debt-to-income ratios, are present but mitigated by other factors such as low loan-to-value ratios, and our niche rehabilitation-to-permanent loans in order to meet the needs of customers in our market area, subject to prudent credit risk management and underwriting policies. We also believe that retention and servicing of the loans that we originate, particularly residential mortgage loans, is important to maintaining our status as a community-focused institution and preserving customer relationships. Accordingly, we intend to continue to retain in our portfolio the majority of the loans that we originate. We do not originate one- to four-family residential or other loans specifically for resale or rely on the sale of loans to generate noninterest income, and do not intend to do so in the future. However, we recognize that a policy of selling and purchasing select loans will allow us to supplement our interest income and, more importantly, manage interest rate risk. As we have done in the past, we will evaluate opportunities to sell certain long-term fixed-rate one- to four-family loans and to purchase quality residential real estate loans when such activities fulfill our asset/liability, interest rate risk and credit risk needs.\nIncreasing core deposits through aggressive marketing and the offering of new deposit products. Although we have historically depended on certificates of deposits to fund our investment activity and loan originations, as well as supporting our liquidity needs, we also offer checking, NOW, savings and money market deposit accounts, which we refer to as core\u201d deposits. We recognize that we can obtain greater leverage from our deposits by focusing on relationship banking rather than one product\u201d customers that typically invest in certificates of deposits. We market core deposits through the internet, in-branch and local mail, print and radio advertising, as well as programs that link various accounts and services together, minimizing service fees. We intend to pursue increased origination of these low cost deposits, with particular focus on transaction accounts, by implementing pro-active marketing and promotional programs, offering attractive interest rates, and offering competitive products to meet the needs of the demographic groups in our market areas, such as remote deposit capture for business customers, mobile banking, and broadening banking relationships with lending customers, particularly as we expand our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending. We expect to focus on employee training and development with respect to deposit generation, deposit retention and knowledge of our products and services so that our branches become sources of deposit generation. We also believe that the implementation of our strategy to increase relationship-based commercial real estate, multi-family non-owner occupied residential and construction lending and to establish additional product delivery channels and technological services such as electronic and mobile banking applications will serve to increase our core deposits. An increase in transaction deposits and relationship banking will decrease our dependence on certificates of deposit, reduce our interest rate sensitivity, and allow us to continue to utilize FHLB advances primarily for asset/liability management purposes rather than to fund our operations.\n 54 \nContinuing to improve our risk profile by managing our credit risk to maintain a low level of non-performing assets and enhancing our policies and procedures as needed. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success, and that managing credit risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. We have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio, while maintaining strong asset quality and moderate credit risk, using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative, as well as diligent monitoring of the portfolio and loans in non-accrual status and on-going collection efforts. In order to grow and increase the profitability of our loan portfolio, we must originate loans that have higher risks than conventional one- to four-family residential loans, including commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, as well as residential loans where certain characteristics of non-conforming loans are present. However, we believe that continued adherence to our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through our experienced, risk-based approach to lending will serve to mitigate the risks associated with such loans. We are committed to devoting significant resources to maintaining low levels of delinquencies and non-performing assets as we diversify our loan portfolio, and we remain acutely focused on the credit risks associated with these loans because we intend to retain the majority of these loans in our portfolio for an extended time.\nOur strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. Specifically, we have implemented procedures to perform internal reviews of selected loans based on risk features and dollar volume. We have instituted a risk-rating matrix to appropriately identify potential risks and rate loans based on key risk characteristics. Additionally, we have implemented a policy that requires a third-party independent loan review of at least 25% of our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction portfolio, with a focus on new relationships, large dollar volume relationships, and identified problem loans. The loan review policy also requires a third-party review of a sample of loans originated by each loan officer. The third party reviewer provides an initial review of risk-rating conclusions and discusses its findings with management. The report is also presented to the board of directors. Final risk-rating conclusions are based on the third party reviewer's independent research plus information provided by management. During the year ended December 31, 2015, a third party reviewed approximately $52.7 million, or approximately 78.4% of our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loan portfolio. The third party reviewer concurred with our internal risk ratings with respect to loans reviewed in its initial findings, based on dollar amount outstanding. Accordingly, management concluded that our improved internal reviews and risk rating procedures are effective in evaluating our credit risk. We believe that policies and procedures are only effective when implemented and monitored by qualified and dedicated personnel. Accordingly, we created the position of Assistant Vice President-Credit Analyst in 2011 and maintain a staff with experience managing commercial loan administration. We expect to hire additional credit administration and collections personnel as needed to support the planned growth of our loan portfolio. We also intend to continually enhance our loan underwriting, credit administration and collection procedures, and to implement improved credit risk management and asset-liability management techniques, such as portfolio stress testing, portfolio credit analysis, and credit decision monitoring matrices. Finally, we believe that focusing on commercial lending relationships with active management teams or owners and on complete banking relationships (instead of loan only relationships) will also mitigate some of the risks associated with commercial and industrial and consumer lending.\nCredit risk management also applies to our investment philosophy. We continually monitor the investment portfolio for credit risk, with a quarterly formal review by our executive committee and our asset/liability committee, of any issuers that have heightened credit risk factors such as rating agency and analyst downgrades and declines in market valuation. We intend to replace maturing investments in 2016 as determined to be appropriate in accordance with our risk management policies, asset/liability analysis and our funding needs.\n 55 \nWe believe that our credit risk and asset quality management initiatives have been effective and, as long as we continually review, evaluate and enhance, as necessary, our policies and procedures, will continue to be effective in maintaining low levels of classified, non-performing and delinquent loans.\nDevelop a commercial and industrial loan origination platform in our market area, including developing an SBA loan program. Our primary immediate strategic focus will be to expand one- to four-family residential lending in our market area and increase commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied and construction lending. However, we believe that, because our market area is increasingly becoming home to a variety of small businesses in our communities that serve the residential population, it is important to develop a commercial and industrial loan origination platform as a secondary complimentary source of income in the medium term. We have actively participated as a lender under the SBA Section 504 lending program, and we are approved as a lender for the Section 7a SBA program. To expand commercial and industrial lending, we intend to target small- to mid-sized commercial clients, including retail businesses and medical and other professional practices, as well as construction firms and traditional commercial businesses, located in our market area; develop loan products that will satisfy the needs of small business borrowers in our market area; and expand SBA offerings in all areas of our market area. We believe that the development of a commercial and industrial lending platform will allow us to provide additional products and services to and deepen our banking relationships with our existing and future commercial customers, including customers engaged in commercial real estate, multi-family and construction industries, and the owners and employees of such businesses.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions, regulatory restrictions and other factors. We have adopted a strategic plan to leverage the capital raised in the offering to increase our earnings base, especially the size of our loan portfolio, and therefore our profitability. In addition, growth of earning assets is essential to our future profitability, and we expect to incur expenses related to the implementation of our growth plan, including hiring initiatives, deposit generation campaigns and any future plans for expansion.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe recently enacted JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nManagement views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses and deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies.\n 56 \nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $22.5 million, or 12.0%, to $210.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $188.0 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net loans of $26.7 million and an increase in available for sale securities of $4.8 million.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Time Deposits with Other Banks. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $7.6 million or 41.7%, to $10.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $18.3 million at December 31, 2014. During 2015, excess liquidity was redeployed into loans. Time deposits with other banks decreased $1.5 million, or 57.8%, to $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $2.6 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in time deposits with other banks reflected their maturation.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased $26.7 million, or 18.5%, to $170.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $143.8 million at December 31, 2014. One-to-four-family residential real estate loans increased $8.4 million, or 8.7%, to $104.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $96.4 million at December 31, 2014, multifamily loans increased $6.4 million, or 62.8%, to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $10.2 million at December 31, 2014, and construction loans increased $6.7 million, or 55.4%, to $18.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $12.1 million at December 31, 2014. Commercial real estate loans increased $4.4 million, or 25.6%, to $21.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $17.4 million at December 31, 2014, commercial and industrial loans increased $1.0 million, or 31.6%, to $4.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2014, and home equity loans and lines of credit decreased $761,000, or 26.7%, to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $2.9 million at December 31, 2014. The Company originated $72.1 million and purchased $8.6 million of new loans during 2015. Partially offsetting the loan originations and purchases were $37.3 million of loan payoffs and amortizations, $3.5 million of mortgages sold to the FHLB, and $13.1 million of unadvanced funds on 2015 originations.\n 57 \nInvestment Securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale increased $4.8 million or 40.7%, to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $11.8 million at December 31, 2014, due to purchases of securities. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity decreased $29,000, or 19.5%, to $120,000 at December 31, 2015 from $149,000 at December 31, 2014 due to payments and a write-down of $3,000. At December 31, 2015, investment securities classified as available-for-sale consisted primarily of debt securities issued by the U.S. government corporations and agencies, debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions, and government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a focus on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2015 increased $46,000, or 2.1%, compared to December 31, 2014 due to normal increases in cash surrender value.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $18.4 million, or 12.2%, to $169.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $151.0 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, demand deposits increased $1.3 million, or 9.4%, to $15.3 million from $14.0 million, NOW account deposits increased $2.0 million, or 10.0%, to $22.3 million from $20.3 million, savings accounts increased $2.5 million, or 14.9%, to $19.8 million from $17.3 million, money market accounts decreased $4.3 million, or 13.1%, to $28.7 million from $33.0 million, while certificates of deposit increased $16.8 million, or 25.2%, to $83.3 million from $66.5 million. Core deposits, which we consider to be our noninterest demand accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts, increased $1.6 million, or 1.9%, to $86.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $84.5 million at December 31, 2014. The growth in certificates of deposit resulted from various promotional campaigns designed to attract new customers to the bank and grow IRA certificate of deposit balances during tax season. In addition, brokered deposits increased $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBorrowings and Other Liabilities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $3.5 million, or 70%, to $8.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $5.0 million at December 31, 2014. Other liabilities, which include interest payable, accruals for employee benefits and medical plans, income taxes payable and normal accruals for expenses, increased $243,000, or 57.4%, to $666,000 at December 31, 2015 from $423,000 at December 31, 2014.\nTotal Stockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $367,000, or 1.2%, to $32.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $31.6 million at December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from $654,000 of net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by $298,000 of shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nGeneral. The Company realized net income of $654,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a net loss of $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by a $725,000 contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation, a $128,000 increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance, and $161,000 of incremental expense associated with being a publicly traded company.\n 58 \nInterest and Dividend Income. On a tax-equivalent basis, total interest and dividend income increased $900,000, or 14.9%, to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest on loans increased $916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher levels of average loans. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $25.9 million to $158.8 million from $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average yield on loans decreased 12 basis points to 4.16% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.28% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of lower yielding, interest-bearing deposits decreased $6.0 million to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The yield on investment securities (on a tax-equivalent basis) decreased 23 basis points to 2.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.27% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The total earning asset yield increased 6 basis points to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $19,000, or 1.8%, to $1.1 million for 2015 from $1.1 million for 2014. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposit accounts was unchanged at $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 0.74% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $790,000, or 0.5%, to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances increased $22,000 to $65,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of FHLB advances increased $4.7 million to $8.6 million for 2015 from $3.9 million for 2014. The cost decreased 33 basis points to 0.76% for 2015 from 1.09% for 2014.\nNet Interest and Dividend Income. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest and dividend income increased $881,000, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from an $900,000 increase in interest income partially offset by a $19,000 increase in interest expense. Average interest-earning assets increased to $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $162.2 million for 2014, and our net interest rate spread increased seven basis points to 3.04% for 2015 from 2.97% for 2014. Our net interest margin improved to 3.19% for 2015 from 3.06% for 2014. The improvement of our interest rate spread and net interest margin was primarily driven by a change in the composition of our interest-earning assets. Average loans increased $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on our analysis of the factors described in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d we recorded a provision for loan losses of $144,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, and no provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $886,000 or 0.52% of total gross loans at December 31, 2015 compared to $743,000, or 0.51% of total gross loans at December 31, 2014. Total non-performing loans were $1.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2014. As a percentage of non-performing loans, the allowance for loan losses was 62.8% at December 31, 2015 compared to 52.4% at December 31, 2014. Total classified loans were $4.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses, which were inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $18,000, or 2.9%, to $597,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline was primarily driven by lower levels of security gains. The net gain on sales and calls of securities was $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $70,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Partially offsetting the decline, gain on sales of loans, net was $64,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n 59 \nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased $349,000 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the one-time $725,000 charitable contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation incurred in 2014. Partially offsetting the charitable contribution absence, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $218,000, professional fees increased $63,000 and occupancy expense increased $54,000.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense was $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $66,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate as a percent of pre-tax income was 35.8% and 125.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 was due to the absence of an increase in the valuation allowance resulting from the contribution to the Foundation in 2014. We performed an evaluation of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In making the determination whether a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized, we seek to evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including the possibility of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $129,000, reducing our net deferred tax asset to $496,000 and $410,000, respectively, at those dates. At December 31, 2015, $83,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance relates to uncertainty regarding the utilization of the $725,000 charitable contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation. The deferred tax asset related to the charitable contribution expires during the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $46,000 of our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 related to the $218,000 write-down of our mutual fund investment managed by Shay Financial. As a result of the termination of this mutual fund investment in January 2014, we must generate future capital gains in order to utilize this portion of our deferred tax asset, which expires during the year ending December 31, 2019.\n 60 \nAverage Balances and Yields\nThe following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. Tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made because we had tax-free interest-earning assets during the years. All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\n\n (1) Includes securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. A tax-equivalent adjustment of $34,000 and $38,000 was applied to tax-exempt income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively using a tax rate of 34%. \n (2) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities. \n (3) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.\n 61 \n\n (1) Includes securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. A tax-equivalent adjustment of $34,000 and $38,000 was applied to tax-exempt income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, using a tax rate of 34%. \nManagement of Market Risk\nGeneral. Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings.\nOver the past several years, management has implemented an asset/liability strategy to manage, subject to our profitability goals, our interest rate risk. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:\n \u00b7 originating commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing checking accounts; \n \u00b7 selectively selling the majority of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate and retaining all of the adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that we originate; \n \u00b7 lengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston; \n \u00b7 increasing our generation of core deposits to support lending and investment activity; \n \u00b7 investing in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and \n 62 \n \u00b7 increasing noninterest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread. \nOur board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our asset/liability committee. This committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a gap analysis\u201d of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities.\nNet Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over a two year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning January 1, 2016 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -400bp, although we believe a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\n\n (1) The calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve. \nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.\n 63 \nNet Present Value of Equity Analysis. In order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value of equity at risk ( NPV\u201d) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve in increments of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The board of directors and management review the methodology's measurements on a quarterly basis.\nThe interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management's best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Pilgrim Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\n\n (1) Assumes instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates. \n (2) EVE or Economic Value of Equity at Risk measures the Bank's exposure to equity due to changes in a forecast interest rate environment. \n (3) EVE Ratio represents Economic Value of Equity divided by the economic value of assets which should translate into built in stability for future earnings. \nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2015, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 6.39% increase in net portfolio value. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 12.45% decrease in net portfolio value.\n 64 \nDepending on the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, we may place greater emphasis on maximizing our net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We believe that the increased net income which may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or re-pricing of our assets and liabilities can, during periods of declining or stable interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify an increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. We believe that our level of interest rate risk is acceptable using this approach.\nWe do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from maturities and calls of securities, maturities of certificate of deposit investments and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 million and $686,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, the purchase of securities and the purchase of time deposits with other banks, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities, proceeds from redemption of time deposits and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $30.5 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased $8.6 million and sold $428,000 in securities held as available-for-sale, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we purchased $3.3 million and sold $3.3 million in securities held as available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of the activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances for 2015 and 2014, and net proceeds from the Conversion in 2014, was $21.5 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a tier 1 leverage capital level of $22.2 million, or 10.9% of average assets, which is above the required level of $10.2 million, or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital of $23.1 million, or 16.2% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of $14.3 million, or 10.0%. Accordingly, Pilgrim Bank was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $5.7 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $18.9 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2015 totaled $45.1 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\n 65 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit.\nWe have not engaged in any other off-balance sheet transactions in the normal course of our lending activities.", "item_7_tables": "Table 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td>

the MD&A report:\n\n- Pilgrim Bancshares is a community bank focused on residential and commercial real estate lending. Its primary sources of revenue are net interest income from loans and investments.\n\n- In 2015, total assets increased 12% to $210.5 million, driven by growth in loans and investment securities. Net loans grew 18.5% to $170.4 million. \n\n- Net income was $654,000 in 2015 compared to a net loss of $119,000 in 2014. The 2014 loss was due to a charitable contribution and costs related to becoming a public company. \n\n- Net interest income increased 17.7% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by loan growth and despite a slight decline in yields.\n\n- The bank manages interest rate risk through strategies like originating more commercial and construction loans with shorter terms, selling fixed rate mortgages, and using wholesale funding sources. Modeling shows a 100 bp increase in rates would decrease net interest income by 1.91% in the first year.\n\n- At year-end 2015, Pilgrim exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was categorized as well capitalized. \n\n- The bank had commitments to originate $5.7 million in loans and $18.9 million in unadvanced loan funds. Maturities of certificates of deposit in the next 12 months totaled $45.1 million.\n\nIn summary, Pilgrim Bancshares grew its loan portfolio and net interest income in 2015 through community banking focused on real estate lending. It is managing interest rate risk and has strong regulatory capital levels."}
