MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d and in Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d\nFiscal Year 2019 Overview\nThe Company is a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, feed, industrial, fuel, bioenergy and fertilizer industries. With operations on five continents, the Company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into useable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The Company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed and fuel ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the Company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. The Company sells its products domestically and internationally and operates within three industry segments: Feed Ingredients, Food Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients.\nThe Feed Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the collection and processing of beef, poultry and pork animal by-products in North America and Europe into non-food grade oils and protein meals, (ii) the collection and processing of bakery residuals in North America into Cookie Meal\u00ae, which is predominantly used in poultry and swine rations, (iii) the collection and processing of used cooking oil in North America into non-food grade fats, (iv) the collection and processing of porcine and bovine blood in China, Europe, North America and Australia into blood plasma powder and hemoglobin, (v) the processing of selected portions of slaughtered animals into a variety of meat products for use in pet food in Europe and North America, (vi) the processing of cattle hides and hog skins in North America, (vii) the production of organic fertilizers using protein produced from the Company's animal by-products processing activities in North America and Europe, and (viii) the rearing and processing of black soldier fly larvae into specialty proteins for use in animal feed and pet food in North America; and (ix) the provision of grease trap services to food service establishments in North America. Non-food grade oils and fats produced and marketed by the Company are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in animal feed and pet food, as an ingredient for the production of biodiesel and renewable diesel, or to the oleo-chemical industry to be used as an ingredient in a wide variety of industrial applications. Protein meals, blood plasma powder and hemoglobin produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in animal feed, pet food and aquaculture.\nThe Food Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the purchase and processing of beef and pork bone chips, beef hides, pig skins, and fish skins into collagen in Europe, China, South America and North America, (ii) the collection and processing of porcine and bovine intestines into natural casings in Europe, China and North America, (iii) the extraction and processing of porcine mucosa into crude heparin in Europe, (iv) the collection and refining of animal fat into food grade fat in Europe, and (v) the processing of bones to bone chips for the collagen industry and bone ash in Europe. Collagens produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, food, pet food and technical (e.g., photographic) industries. Natural casings produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as an ingredient in the production of sausages and other similar food products.\nThe Fuel Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the Company's share of the results of its equity investment in Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC, a joint venture with Valero Energy Corporation ( Valero\u201d) to convert animal fats, recycled greases, used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, soybean oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable into renewable diesel (the DGD Joint Venture\u201d) as described in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 28, 2019 included herein, (ii) the conversion of animal fats and recycled greases into biodiesel in North America, (iii) the conversion of organic sludge and food waste into biogas in Europe, (iv) the collection and conversion of fallen stock and certain animal by-products pursuant to applicable E.U. regulations into low-grade energy sources to be used in industrial applications, and (v) the processing of manure into natural bio-phosphate in Europe.\nCorporate Activities principally includes unallocated corporate overhead expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense net of interest income, and other non-operating income and expenses.\nOperating Performance Indicators\nThe Company monitors the performance of its business segments using key financial metrics such as results of operations, non-GAAP measurements (Adjusted EBITDA), segment operating income, raw material processed, gross margin percentage, foreign currency translation, and corporate activities. The Company's operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as the fluctuation in energy prices, weather conditions, crop harvests, government policies and programs, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, protein consumption, and global production of competing ingredients. Due to these unpredictable factors that are beyond the control of the Company, forward-looking financial or operational estimates are not provided. The Company is exposed to certain risks associated with a business that is influenced by agricultural-based commodities. These risks are further described in Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company's Feed Ingredients segment animal by-products, bakery residuals, used cooking oil recovery, and blood operations are each influenced by prices for agricultural-based alternative ingredients such as corn oil, soybean oil, soybean meal, and palm oil. In these operations, the costs of the Company's raw materials change with, or in certain cases are indexed to, the selling price or the anticipated selling price of the finished goods produced from the acquired raw materials and/or in some cases, the price spread between various types of finished products. The Company believes that this methodology of procuring raw materials generally establishes a relatively stable gross margin upon the acquisition of the raw material. Although the costs of raw materials for the Feed Ingredients segment are generally based upon actual or anticipated finished goods selling prices, rapid and material changes in finished goods prices, including competing agricultural-based alternative ingredients, generally have an immediate and often times, material impact on the Company's gross margin and profitability resulting from the brief lapse of time between the procurement of the raw materials and the sale of the finished goods. In addition, the volume of raw material volume acquired, which has a direct impact on the amount of finished goods produced, can also have a material effect on the gross margin reported, as the Company has a substantial amount of fixed operating costs.\nThe Company's Food Ingredients segment collagen and natural casings products are influenced by other competing ingredients including plant-based and synthetic hydrocolloids and artificial casings. In the collagen operation, the cost of the Company's animal-based raw material moves in relationship to the selling price of the finished goods. The processing time for the Food Ingredients segment collagen and casings is generally 30 to 60 days, which is substantially longer than the Company's Feed Ingredients segment animal by-products operations. Consequently, the Company's gross margin and profitability in this segment can be influenced by the movement of finished goods prices from the time the raw materials were procured until the finished goods are sold.\nThe Company's Fuel Ingredients segment converts fats into renewable diesel, organic sludge and food waste into biogas, and fallen stock into low-grade energy sources. The Company's gross margin and profitability in this segment are impacted by world energy prices for oil, electricity, natural gas and governmental subsidies.\nThe reporting currency for the Company's financial statements is the U.S. dollar. The Company operates in over 15 countries and therefore, certain of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the Euro, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Polish zloty. To prepare the Company's consolidated financial statements, assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. This could have a significant impact on the Company's results, if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies is substantial.\nIn 2019, the Company continued to evaluate operational developments and the impact of anticipated significant expansion of the DGD Joint Venture. This evaluation was impactful to the consideration of how the Company most appropriately reflects its share of equity income from the DGD Joint Venture. Based on the Company's analysis, it was determined that the DGD Joint Venture has evolved into an integral and integrated part of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company determined this justifies a more meaningful and transparent presentation of equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture as a component of the Company's operating income. As a result, the Company has reclassified its equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture to operating income for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter ended September 28, 2019, the equity in Diamond Green Diesel was presented below the operating income line in the Company's published results. Commencing with the third quarter of 2019, the Company is including its equity in earnings of Diamond Green Diesel in operating income for all periods presented.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nOperating Performance Metrics\nOther operating performance metrics indicators which management routinely monitors as an indicator of operating performance include:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Finished product commodity prices\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Segment results\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Foreign currency exchange\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Corporate activities\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-U.S. GAAP measures\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese indicators and their importance are discussed below.\nFinished Product Commodity Prices\nPrices for finished product commodities that the Company produces in the Feed Ingredients segment are reported each business day on the Jacobsen Index (the Jacobsen\u201d), an established North American trading exchange price publisher. The Jacobsen reports industry sales from the prior day's activity by product. Included on the Jacobsen are reported prices for finished products such as MBM, PM and feather meal ( FM\u201d), hides, BFT and YG and corn, which is a substitute commodity for the Company's BBP as well as a range of other branded and value-added products, which are products of the Company's Feed Ingredients segment. In the U.S. the Company regularly monitors the Jacobsen for MBM, PM, FM, BFT, YG and corn because it provides a daily indication of the Company's U.S. revenue performance against business plan benchmarks. In Europe, the Company regularly monitors Thomson Reuters ( Reuters\u201d) to track the competing commodities palm oil and soy meal.\nAlthough the Jacobsen and Reuters provide useful metrics of performance, the Company's finished products are commodities that compete with other commodities such as corn, soybean oil, palm oil complex, soybean meal and heating oil on nutritional and functional values. Therefore, actual pricing for the Company's finished products, as well as competing products, can be quite volatile. In addition, neither the Jacobsen nor Reuters provides forward or future period pricing for the Company's commodities. The Jacobsen and Reuters prices quoted below are for delivery of the finished product at a specified location. Although the Company's prices generally move in concert with reported Jacobsen and Reuters prices, the Company's actual sales prices for its finished products may vary significantly from the Jacobsen and Reuters because of production and delivery timing differences and because the Company's finished products are delivered to multiple locations in different geographic regions which utilize alternative price indexes. In addition, certain of the Company's premium branded finished products may sell at prices that may be higher than the closest product on the related Jacobsen or Reuters index. During fiscal year 2019, the Company's actual sales prices by product trended with the disclosed Jacobsen and Reuters prices.\nAverage Jacobsen and Reuters prices (at the specified delivery point) for fiscal year 2019, compared to average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for fiscal year 2018 are:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Avg.

Protein net sales were approximately $791.3 million and $842.9 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Other rendering net sales, which include hides, pet food, and service charges, were approximately $167.9 million and $129.3 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Total rendering net sales were approximately $1,543.5 million and $1,536.9 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Used cooking oil net sales were approximately $185.7 million and $166.7 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Bakery net sales were approximately $191.6 million and $180.2 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, and other net sales, which includes trap services, were approximately $49.8 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nThe increase in net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment was primarily due to the following (in millions of dollars):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fats\n</td> <td>Proteins\n</td> <td>Other Rendering\n</td> <td>Total Rendering\n</td> <td>Used Cooking Oil\n</td> <td>Bakery\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,536.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,952.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in sales volumes\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in finished product prices\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) due to currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other change (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>38.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>791.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,543.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,970.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The decrease in other net sales is primarily a result of the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business in May 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMargins. In the Feed Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 22.9% as compared to 23.3% for fiscal year 2018. The decrease in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to lower protein finished product prices.\nSegment operating income. Feed Ingredients' operating income for fiscal year 2019 was $54.7 million, a decrease of $28.1 million as compared to fiscal year 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in protein finished product sales prices, lower spreads in poultry pet grade products, higher compensation and depreciation and amortization costs from the addition of several new facilities in the U.S.\nFood Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Food Ingredients segment totaled 1.08 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Food Ingredients segment decreased approximately (3.4)%. The decline was primarily due to certain food grade raw materials being diverted directly to the Chinese food markets as a result of ASF.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Food Ingredients segment primarily due to lower food grade bone and fat raw material volumes and therefore lower sales volumes, lower casings sales prices and strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018. These factors were somewhat offset by higher hydrolyzed collagen sales volumes and values.\nMargins. In the Food Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 22.7% as compared to 19.4% for fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily due to improved margins from the growth of the collagen business and the closure of the Argentina collagen plant which more than offset lower casing and edible fat margins.\nSegment operating income. Food Ingredients' operating income was $90.6 million for fiscal year 2019, an increase of $56.8 million or 168.0% as compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily due to improved results in the collagen markets, a gain on sale of assets in China and no restructuring and impairment charges in the current year as compared to fiscal year 2018 when the Company closed its Argentina collagen plant.\nFuel Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Fuel Ingredients segment totaled 1.26 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Fuel Ingredients segment increased approximately 7.2%.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Fuel Ingredients segment primarily due the European business sales that translated to less U.S. dollar sales as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar as well as lower diesel and RIN values in North America.\nMargins. In the Fuel Ingredients segment (exclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 25.3% as compared to 22.2% for fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily related to the fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, as compared to 2017 blenders tax credits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nSegment operating income.The Company's Fuel Ingredients segment operating income (inclusive of the equity contribution from DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2019 was $398.8 million, an increase of $203.7 million or 104.4% as compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to 2017 reinstated blenders tax credits booked in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nForeign Currency\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Euro and Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal year 2018. Using actual results for fiscal year 2019 and the prior year's average foreign currency rates for fiscal year 2018 would result in an increase in operating income of approximately $16.9 million. The average rates assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for fiscal year 2019 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.12 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.75 as compared to the average rate for fiscal year 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nCorporate Activities\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $57.9 million during fiscal year 2019, a $12.1 million increase from $45.8 million during fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate related compensation benefits and other corporate expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $0.5 million to $10.4 million during fiscal year 2019 as compared to $10.9 million during fiscal year 2018. The decrease was due to certain of the Company's corporate assets becoming fully depreciated as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $78.7 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $86.4 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $7.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to an interest rate decrease on the Company's euro and U.S. based senior notes, a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization and a reduction in term loan A and term loan B interest due to lower interest rates and lower debt outstanding as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nDebt Extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs were $12.1 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $23.5 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease was due to lower tender and redemption premiums and write-off of deferred loan costs on the 5.375% Senior Notes as compared to the 4.75% Senior Notes extinguished in fiscal year 2018.\nForeign Currency Losses. Foreign currency losses were $1.3 million during fiscal year 2019, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.4 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease is due primarily to lower losses on the revaluation of non-functional currency liabilities as compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.\nGain (loss) on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries represents a gain incurred in fiscal year 2019 on the sale of the Company's trap business in Canada and a gain on the sale of a foreign consolidated joint venture in Europe. The loss on sale of subsidiaries in fiscal year 2018 represents the loss recorded on the sale of a domestic subsidiary that more than offset a gain recorded on the liquidation of a majority owned foreign joint venture.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense was $6.7 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $7.6 million in fiscal year 2018. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to an increase in insurance proceeds on fire and casualty losses that more than offset an increase in the non-service cost component of pension expense and a reduction of interest income.\nEquity in Net Income in Investment of Other Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This primarily represents the Company's pro rata share of the net income from its foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries other than the DGD Joint Venture that more than offset net losses from a domestic unconsolidated subsidiary.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded income tax expense of $59.5 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $12.0 million of income tax expense recorded in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $47.5 million, which was primarily due to an increase in income from operations before income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 was 15.6% and 10.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2018 and 2019 during 2019 and the relative mix of earnings among jurisdictions with different tax rates. Excluding the impact of the 2018 and 2019 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 27.4%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 during 2018, tax law changes in the Netherlands, and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to deferred tax assets for tax losses that are not expected to be utilized in future years. Excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 34.4%.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance. Since EBITDA (generally, net income plus interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is not calculated identically by all companies, the presentation in this report may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA presentations disclosed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated below and represents, for any relevant period, net income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, (income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, income tax provision, other income/(expense) and equity in net (income)/loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and certain non-cash and other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nAs a result, the Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure to evaluate performance and for other discretionary purposes. In addition to the foregoing, management also uses or will use Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain financial covenants under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes that were outstanding at December 28, 2019. However, the amounts shown below for Adjusted EBITDA differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes, as those definitions permit further adjustments to reflect certain other non-recurring costs, non-cash charges and cash dividends from the DGD Joint Venture. Additionally, the Company evaluates the impact of foreign currency exchange on operating cash flow, which is defined as segment operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization.\nReconciliation of Net Income to (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA and (Non-GAAP) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal Year 2019 As Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 28,\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Darling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>312,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>325,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>78,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>59,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>6,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>12,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss/(gain) on disposal of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>(2,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income of Diamond Green Diesel\n</td> <td>(364,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(159,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss/(income) of other unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>8,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange impact (1)\n</td> <td>16,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Darling plus Darling's share of DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The average rate assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.12 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.75 as compared to the average rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) of $436.9 million, as compared to $431.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2018. The increase is attributable to higher margin collagen in the Feed Ingredients segment.\nOn a Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP) basis, the Company would have generated $453.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $431.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nDGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share) is not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA, the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, or the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP).

In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Feed Ingredients segment totaled 8.60 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Feed Ingredients segment increased approximately 4.4%.\nSales. During the year ended December 29, 2018, net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment were $1,952.6 million as compared to $2,239.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2017, a decrease of approximately $286.9 million. Net sales for fats were approximately $564.7 million and $648.3 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Protein net sales were approximately $842.9 million and $816.1 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Other rendering net sales, which include hides, pet food, and service charges, were approximately $129.3 million and $286.2 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Total rendering net sales were approximately $1,536.9 million and $1,750.6 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Used cooking oil net sales were approximately $166.7 million and $185.5 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Bakery net sales were approximately $180.2 million and $209.8 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 and other sales, which includes trap services, and for 2017 industrial residual services, were approximately $68.8 million and $93.6 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\nThe decrease in net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment was primarily due to the following (in millions of dollars):\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fats\n</td> <td>Proteins\n</td> <td>Other Rendering\n</td> <td>Total Rendering\n</td> <td>Used Cooking Oil\n</td> <td>Bakery\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 30, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>816.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,750.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,239.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in sales volumes\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in finished product prices\n</td> <td>(85.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) due to currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freight revenue (1)\n</td> <td>(37.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(57.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(21.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other change (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(152.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(152.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(177.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change\n</td> <td>(83.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(213.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(29.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(286.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,536.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,952.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The decrease in freight revenue represents the impact from adoption of the new revenue standard on current year Feed Segment revenue as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2017.

In addition, the decrease in other net sales is due to the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business in May 2018.\nMargins. In the Feed Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 23.3% as compared to 22.1% for fiscal year 2017. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the new revenue standard whereby the Company no longer includes billed freight in revenue, as it did in fiscal year 2017.\nSegment operating income. Feed Ingredients' operating income for fiscal year 2018 was $82.8 million, a decrease of $49.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2017. Segment operating income was down in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to lower finished fat product prices and higher depreciation charges from increased capital expenditures that more than offset increased raw material volumes.\nFood Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Food Ingredients segment totaled 1.11 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Food Ingredients segment decreased approximately (0.2)%.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Food Ingredients segment as a result of the permanent shut down of the Company's Hurlingham, Argentina collagen plant, a more competitive European collagen market and lower edible fat sales prices.\nMargins. In the Food Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 19.4% as compared to 20.5% for fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower margins from European collagen due to lower sales volumes and pressure on margins from export sales, combined with an increase in raw material prices for casings and a decrease in edible fat sales prices.\nSegment operating income. Food Ingredients' operating income was $33.8 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $23.1 million or (40.6)% as compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the restructuring and impairment charges incurred as a result of the Hurlingham, Argentina collagen plant shut down and lower earnings in the European collagen market. The casings business delivered slightly lower earnings in fiscal year 2018 due to an increase of raw material prices as compared to fiscal year 2017. The Company's edible fat prices were lower in fiscal year 2018 as a result of competing fat markets as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nFuel Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Fuel Ingredients segment totaled 1.18 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Fuel Ingredients segment decreased approximately (0.6)%.\nSales. Overall sales increased in the Fuel Ingredients segment primarily due to higher sales volumes at Ecoson and in North America due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 of approximately $12.6 million as compared to no blenders tax credits in the same period in fiscal year 2017.\nMargins. In the Fuel Ingredients segment (exclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 22.2% as compared to 20.8% for fiscal year 2017. This increase was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits in North America recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nSegment operating income. The Company's Fuel Ingredients segment income (inclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2018 was $195.1 million, an increase of $152.9 million or 362.3% as compared to fiscal year 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits in North America recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the lack of blenders tax credits in the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nForeign Currency\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the U.S. dollar weakened against most of the other functional currencies used by the Company's non-domestic operations when compared to fiscal year 2017. Using actual results for fiscal year 2018 and the prior year's average foreign currency rates for fiscal year 2017 would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $8.6 million. The average rates assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for fiscal year 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77 as compared to the average rate for fiscal year 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.13 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nCorporate Activities\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $45.8 million during fiscal year 2018, a $4.4 million decrease from $50.2 million during fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in corporate related compensation benefits and other corporate expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $1.0 million to $10.9 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to $11.9 million during fiscal year 2017. The decrease was due to certain of the Company's corporate assets becoming fully depreciated as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $86.4 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $88.9 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $2.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to an interest rate decrease on the Company's euro based senior notes, a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization and a reduction in other debt interest that more than offset an increase in revolver interest from higher fiscal year 2018 revolver borrowings as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nDebt Extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs were $23.5 million during fiscal year 2018, compared to none for fiscal year 2017. The costs in 2018 were due to tender and redemption premiums and the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the retirement of the 4.75% Senior Notes.\nForeign Currency Losses. Foreign currency losses were $6.4 million during fiscal year 2018, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.9 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease in foreign currency losses was primarily due to reduction in losses on non-designated foreign exchange hedge contracts as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nLoss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Loss on disposal of subsidiaries represents a loss recorded from the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business during fiscal year 2018, that more than offset a gain recorded on the liquidation of a majority owned foreign joint venture in fiscal year 2018, as compared to a loss booked in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the sale of a portion of a majority owned foreign subsidiary.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense was $7.6 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $8.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in other expense for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in non-service cost component of pension expense that more than offset an increase in casualty losses in fiscal year 2018 and a reduction of interest income.\nEquity in Net Income/(loss) of Other Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This primarily represents the Company's pro rata share for fiscal year 2018 net losses of its domestic unconsolidated subsidiary other than the DGD Joint Venture that more than offset net income from foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries as compared to fiscal year 2017, which included net income of foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries that more than offset net losses of the Company's domestic unconsolidated subsidiary.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded income tax expense of $12.0 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $69.2 million of income tax benefit recorded in fiscal year 2017, an increase of $81.2 million, which was primarily due to tax law changes enacted in December 2017 with respect to several of the Company's major tax jurisdictions. Specifically, in fiscal year 2017 a tax benefit of $75.0 million was recorded due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d or U.S. tax reform\u201d) in the United States, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and a tax benefit of $13.9 million was recorded for tax law changes in Belgium and France ( European tax law changes\u201d). The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 was 10.2% and (107.7)%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 during 2018, tax law changes in the Netherlands, and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to deferred tax assets for tax losses that are not expected to be utilized in future years. The biofuel tax incentive expired as of the end of fiscal year 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 34.4%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 differs from the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax reform, European tax law changes, the relative mix of earnings among jurisdictions\nwith different tax rates, and subpart F income. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and European tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 is 30.8%.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nFor a discussion of the reasons the Company's management believes the following Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and the purposes for which the Company's management uses such measures, see Results of Operations - Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 - Non-U.S. GAAP Measures.\u201d\nReconciliation of Net Income to (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA and (Non-GAAP) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal Year 2018 As Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Darling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>321,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>86,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense/(benefit)\n</td> <td>12,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges\n</td> <td>14,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>6,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>7,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>23,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>12,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net (income) of Diamond Green Diesel\n</td> <td>(159,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(28,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss/(income) of other unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>4,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange impact (1)\n</td> <td>(8,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Darling plus Darling's share of DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The average rate assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77 as compared to the average rate for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.13 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) of $431.4 million, as compared to $443.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017.

On January 6, 2014, Darling, Darling International Canada Inc. ( Darling Canada\u201d) and Darling International NL Holdings B.V. ( Darling NL\u201d) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), restating its then existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 27, 2013, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other agents from time to time party thereto. Effective December 18, 2017, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) with its lenders to the Amended Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fifth Amendment (i) refinanced the term B loans under the Amended Credit Agreement with new term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million with a maturity date of December 18, 2024; (ii) adjusted the applicable margin pricing on borrowings under the term B loan; (iii) modified certain of the negative covenants to increase the allowances for certain actions, including debt and investments; and (iv) made other updates and changes. Effective December 16, 2016, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) with its lenders to the Amended Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fourth Amendment extended the maturity date of the term A loans and revolving credit facility loans under the Amended Credit Agreement from September 27, 2018 to December 16, 2021.

On April 3, 2019, Darling issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 5.25% Notes\u201d). The 5.25% Notes, which were offered in a private offering, were issued pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of April 3, 2019 (the 5.25% Indenture\u201d), among Darling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, and Regions Bank, as trustee. The gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance all of the Company's formerly outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 5.375% Notes\u201d), by cash tender offer for and redemption of all of the Company's then-outstanding 5.375% Notes, to pay the discount of the initial purchasers and to pay other fees and expenses related to the offering of the 5.25% Notes. The refinancing of the 5.375% Notes was completed in the second quarter of 2019. For a description of the terms of the 5.25% Notes see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n3.625 % Senior Notes due 2026. On May 2, 2018, Darling Global Finance B.V. issued and sold \u20ac515 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 3.625% Notes\u201d). The 3.625% Notes, which were offered in a private offering, were issued pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of May 2, 2018, among Darling Global Finance B.V., Darling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee and principal paying agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Deutschland AG, as principal registrar. The gross proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, were used to refinance all of the then Company's formerly outstanding 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 4.75% Notes\u201d) by cash tender offer and redemption of those notes and to pay any applicable premiums for the refinancing, to pay the commission of the initial purchasers of the 3.625% Notes and to pay the other fees and expenses related to the offering. The refinancing of the 4.75% Notes was completed in the second quarter of 2018. For a description of the terms of the 3.625% Notes see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther debt consists of U.S., Canadian and European ancillary and overdraft facilities and capital lease obligations and note arrangements in Brazil, China and Europe that are not part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, 5.25% Notes or 3.625% Notes.\nThe classification of long-term debt in the Company's December 28, 2019 consolidated balance sheet is based on the contractual repayment terms of the 5.25% Notes, the 3.625% Notes and debt issued under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of the Company's borrowings under its Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture, the Company is highly leveraged. Investors should note that, in order to make scheduled payments on the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, and otherwise, the Company will rely in part on a combination of dividends, distributions and intercompany loan repayments from the Company's direct and indirect U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The Company is prohibited under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture from entering (or allowing such subsidiaries to enter) into contractual limitations on the Company's subsidiaries' ability to declare dividends or make other payments or distributions to the Company. The Company has also attempted to structure the Company's consolidated indebtedness in such a way as to maximize the Company's ability to move cash from the Company's subsidiaries to Darling or another subsidiary that will have fewer limitations on the ability to make upstream payments, whether to Darling or directly to the Company's lenders as a Guarantor. Nevertheless, applicable laws under which the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries are formed may provide limitations on such dividends, distributions and other payments. In addition, regulatory authorities in various countries where the Company operates or where the Company imports or exports products may from time to time impose import/export limitations, foreign exchange controls or currency devaluations that may limit the Company's access to profits from the Company's subsidiaries or otherwise negatively impact the Company's financial condition and therefore reduce the Company's ability to make required payments under Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, or otherwise. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange values may have a negative impact on the Company's ability to repay indebtedness denominated in U.S. or Canadian dollars or euros. See Risk Factors - Our business may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, which could affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants\u201d and - Our ability to repay our indebtedness depends in part on the performance of our subsidiaries, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and their ability to make payments\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.\nAs of December 28, 2019, the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, as well as all of the other covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture.\nWorking Capital and Capital Expenditures\nOn December 28, 2019, the Company had working capital of $228.9 million and its working capital ratio was 1.33 to 1 compared to working capital of $357.4 million and a working capital ratio of 1.66 to 1 on December 29, 2018. At December 28, 2019, the Company had unrestricted cash of $72.9 million and funds available under the revolving credit facility of $911.9 million, compared to unrestricted cash of $107.3 million and funds available under the revolving credit facility of $929.8 million at December 29, 2018. The Company diversifies its cash investments by limiting the amounts deposited with any one financial institution and invests primarily in government-backed securities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $362.6 million and $398.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, a decrease of $36.0 million due primarily to an increase in net income that was mostly offset by equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture and to changes in operating assets and liabilities that include a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of approximately $19.8 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and inventory of $41.5 million, a decrease in other of approximately $8.8 million, an increase in income taxes refundable/payable of approximately $19.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expense of approximately $17.9 million. Cash used by investing activities was $338.1 million during fiscal year 2019, compared to $342.4 million in fiscal year 2018, a decrease in cash used of $4.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets that was more than offset by an increase in cash received from insurance. Net cash used by financing activities was $54.9 million during fiscal year 2019, compared to $47.6 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase in cash used of $7.3 million, primarily due to purchases of common stock that more than offset a decrease in debt payments as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nCapital expenditures of $359.5 million were made during fiscal year 2019 as compared to $321.9 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $37.6 million, or 11.7%. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures for expansion in fiscal 2019. In fiscal year 2020, the Company expects to incur approximately $236.0 million in maintenance and compliance type capital expenditures and approximately $70.0 million for new construction (including expansions) for a total of approximately $306.0 million. These costs are expected to be financed using cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations were $37.4 million in fiscal year 2019, $32.1 million in fiscal year 2018 and $27.5 million in fiscal year 2017.\nAccrued Insurance and Pension Plan Obligations\nBased upon the annual actuarial estimate, current accruals and claims paid during fiscal year 2019, the Company has accrued approximately $9.7 million as of December 28, 2019 that it expects will become due during the next twelve months in order to meet obligations related to the Company's self insurance reserves and accrued insurance obligations, which are included in current accrued expenses at December 28, 2019. The self insurance reserve is composed of estimated liability for claims arising for workers' compensation and for auto liability and general liability claims. The self insurance reserve liability is determined annually, based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The actuarial estimate may vary from year to year, due to changes in costs of health care, the pending number of claims and other factors beyond the control of management of the Company.\nBased upon current actuarial estimates, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $0.9 million in order to meet minimum pension funding requirements to its domestic plans in fiscal year 2020. In addition, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $3.4 million under its foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2020. The minimum pension funding requirements are determined annually, based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The actuarial estimate may vary from year to year, due to fluctuations in return on investments or other factors beyond the control of management of the Company or the administrator of the Company's pension funds. No assurance can be given that the minimum pension funding requirements will not increase in the future. The Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its domestic pension plans in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 of approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2019 of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to $3.5 million in contributions in fiscal year 2018.\nThe U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( PPA\u201d) went into effect in January 2008. The stated goal of the PPA is to improve the funding of U.S. pension plans. U.S. plans in an under-funded status are required to increase employer contributions to improve the funding level within PPA timelines. Volatility in the world equity and other financial markets could have a material negative impact on U.S. pension plan assets and the status of required funding under the PPA. The Company participates in various U.S. multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. The Company's contributions to each individual U.S. multiemployer plan represent less than 5% of the total contributions to each such plan. Based on the most currently available information, the Company has determined that, if a withdrawal were to occur, withdrawal liabilities on two of the U.S. plans in which the Company\ncurrently participates could be material to the Company, with one of these material plans certified as critical or red zone. With respect to the other U.S. multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates and which are not individually significant, five plans have certified as critical or red zone and two have certified as endangered or yellow zone, as defined by the PPA. The Company has received notices of withdrawal liability from five U.S. multiemployer pension plans in which it participated. As a result, the Company has an accrued aggregate current liability of approximately $6.0 million representing the present value of scheduled withdrawal liability payments under these multiemployer plans. While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multiemployer plans that could terminate or could require additional funding under the PPA, the amounts could be material.\nDGD Joint Venture\nThe Company announced on January 21, 2011 that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darling entered into a limited liability company agreement with Valero to form the DGD Joint Venture. The DGD Joint Venture is owned 50% / 50% with Valero and was formed to design, engineer, construct and operate the DGD Facility, which as a result of its recently expanded capacity is now capable of processing approximately 20,000 barrels per day of input feedstock to produce renewable diesel fuel and certain other co-products, and is located adjacent to Valero's refinery in Norco, Louisiana. The DGD Joint Venture reached mechanical completion and began the production of renewable diesel in late June 2013. Effective May 1, 2019, the DGD LLC Agreement was amended and restated for the purpose of updating the agreement in certain respects, including to remove certain provisions that were no longer relevant and to add new provisions relating to the DGD Joint Venture's recently approved expansion project to construct a new, parallel facility located next to the current facility, as further described below.\nOn May 1, 2019, Darling, through its wholly owned subsidiary Darling Green Energy LLC, ( Darling Green\u201d), and Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero ( Diamond Alternative\u201d and together with Darling Green, the DGD Lenders\u201d) entered into a revolving loan agreement (the DGD Loan Agreement\u201d) with the DGD Joint Venture. The DGD Lenders have committed to make loans available to the DGD Joint Venture in the total amount of $50.0 million with each lender committed to $25.0 million of the total commitment. Any borrowings by the DGD Joint Venture under the DGD Loan Agreement are at the applicable annum rate equal to the sum of (a) the LIBO Rate (meaning Reuters BBA Libor Rates Page 3750) on such day plus (b) 2.50%. The DGD Loan Agreement matures on April 29, 2020, unless extended by agreement of the parties. The DGD Loan Agreement replaces a similar agreement with lower commitment levels that expired on December 31, 2018. As of December 28, 2019, no amounts are owed to the DGD Lenders under the DGD Loan Agreement.\nBased on the sponsor support agreements executed in connection with the initial construction of the DGD Facility, the Company contributed a total of approximately $111.7 million for completion of the DGD Facility including the Company's portion of cost overruns and working capital funding. As of December 28, 2019, under the equity method of accounting the Company has an investment in the DGD Joint Venture of approximately $661.5 million included on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn August 2018, the DGD Joint Venture completed an expansion project that increased the DGD Facility's annual production capacity from 160 million gallons of renewable diesel to 275 million gallons and expanded outbound logistics for servicing the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. In November 2018, the joint venture partners approved the DGD Joint Venture moving forward with another expansion project to construct a new, parallel facility (the New Facility\u201d) located next to the current facility. The New Facility is expected to grow the DGD Joint Venture's annual production capacity by an additional 400 million gallons from the current capacity of 275 million gallons of renewable diesel to 675 million gallons of renewable diesel and provide the capability to separate naphtha for sale into low carbon fuel markets. In addition, the expansion project includes further expanded inbound and outbound logistics for servicing the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. The DGD Joint Venture estimates completion and startup of the New Facility in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the total cost of the expansion project, including the naphtha production and improved logistics capability, is estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Based on forecasted margins as of the date of this report, the expansion project is expected to be substantially funded by DGD Joint Venture cash flow; however, the DGD LLC Agreement provides that until such time as the New Facility is complete and operational, the joint venture partners shall be required to make capital contributions or, if they agree, loans, to the DGD Joint Venture should the excess available cash in the DGD Joint Venture, as determined on specified dates and in accordance with the provisions contained in the DGD LLC Agreement, fall below $50 million.\nIn April 2019, the joint venture partners adopted a distribution policy that, unless earlier terminated by the partners, will remain in place through the construction and completion of the New Facility. Pursuant to the distribution policy, the DGD Joint Venture will make quarterly distributions to the partners to the extent that distributable cash (as determined in accordance with the policy) exceeds $50 million and as allowed by the DGD Joint Venture's forward looking cash forecast. During the year ended December 28, 2019, the DGD Joint Venture made approximately $67.5 million distributions to each of the partners.\nThe Company's original investment in DGD has expanded since 2011 to the point that it is now integral to how Darling operates its business. Darling traditionally collected and converted used cooking oil and animal fats into feed ingredients which were sold on a caloric value to feed animals as well as for industrial technical uses. Over the past decade, the world's increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas has provided a new finished market for the Company's finished fats ingredients. With Darling's significant fats ownership, this has and continues to transform how Darling operates. In 2018, a large portion of Darling's total U.S. finished fats products were sold to the DGD Facility as feedstock for renewable diesel. This percentage is expected to noticeably increase both in 2019 and beyond due to the recent DGD capacity expansion completed in August 2018 and the even larger expansion to be finished in late 2021. In 2019 and 2018, DGD was Darling's largest finished product customer in terms of sales, with Darling recording sales of $208.7 million and $131.8 million to DGD, respectively.\nFrom a procurement, production and distribution standpoint, DGD has become integral to Darling's base business. DGD is integral to the Company's operations via the combined vertical operating structure from collecting raw fats, to processing collected fats at Darling facilities nationwide to transporting the refined fats to the DGD facility as feedstock. The Darling supply chain has become more efficient and sustainable with transparency for verification to obtain full value to low carbon intensity markets. The development of the low carbon markets in North America and Europe has influenced how Darling operates its core business and has also been a driver for the recent DGD expansions, which are making DGD much more relevant to Darling's earnings. Since 2011 when construction began on DGD, Darling has invested substantially to increase its U.S. railcar fleet to efficiently manage nationwide transportation of Darling fats to DGD. Additionally, Darling acquired an Iowa location on the Mississippi River that further enhances the ability of the Company's Midwest network of facilities to collect and deliver feedstocks to DGD via water, rail or truck from a centralized location. Darling has also stepped up collection efforts by providing indoor used cooking oil collection units in exchange for extended collection contracts at eating establishments and has moved to more of a centralized digital marketing effort with restaurant chains and franchise groups and invested in internet search engine key words to improve visibility with restaurants. The Company also includes DGD in marketing efforts to emphasize environmental sustainability that restaurants participate in when their used cooking oil is collected by Darling. From a production standpoint, Darling now isolates used cooking oil from other fats to preserve identification to qualify for a higher carbon intensity value. As a result, the Company has reclassified its equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture to operating income for all periods presented.\nIn September 2019, the Company announced that the DGD Joint Venture was initiating an advanced engineering and development cost review for construction of a new renewable diesel plant to be located in Port Arthur, Texas. The proposed facility under review would be designed to produce 400 million gallons of renewable diesel annually as well as 40 million gallons of renewable naphtha. The final investment decision on the project is expected in 2021, subject to further engineering, obtaining necessary permits, and approval by the boards of the Company and Valero. If the decision is made to move forward, new plant construction could begin in 2021, with expected operations commencing in 2024.\nFinancial Impact of Significant Debt Outstanding\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our financial lenders and our contractual and commercial commitments, limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows from operations available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and business conditions, expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors, and/or increase our cost of borrowing.\nCash Flows and Liquidity Risks\nManagement believes that the Company's cash flows from operating activities consistent with the level generated in fiscal year 2019, unrestricted cash and funds available under the Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet the Company's working capital needs and maintenance and compliance-related capital expenditures, scheduled debt and interest payments, income tax obligations, and other contemplated needs through the next twelve months. Numerous factors could have adverse consequences to the Company that cannot be estimated at this time, such as those factors discussed below under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could negatively impact the Company's results of operations in fiscal year 2020 and thereafter. The Company reviews the appropriate use of unrestricted cash periodically. As of the date of this\nreport, no decision has been made as to non-ordinary course material cash usages at this time; however, potential usages could include: opportunistic capital expenditures and/or acquisitions and joint ventures; investments relating to the Company's renewable energy strategy, including, without limitation, potential required funding obligations with respect to the DGD Joint Venture expansion project or potential investments in additional renewable diesel and/or biodiesel projects; investments in response to governmental regulations relating to human and animal food safety or other regulations; unexpected funding required by the legislation, regulation or mass termination of multiemployer plans; and paying dividends or repurchasing stock, subject to limitations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, as well as suitable cash conservation to withstand adverse commodity cycles. In August 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock depending on market conditions. On August 7, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the extension for an additional two years of its previously announced share repurchase program and refreshed the amount of the program back up to its original amount of an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock depending on market conditions. To that point, the Company had previously repurchased $10.9 million shares of its Common stock under the program. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. On November 6, 2018, the Board approved an increase in the share repurchase program from $100.0 million to $200.0 million and extended the term of the program for an additional year to August 13, 2020. Repurchases may occur through August 13, 2020, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors. Since the inception of the share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased approximately $30.1 million of its common stock in open market purchases and, as of the date of this report, has $180.8 million remaining in its share repurchase program.\nEach of the factors described above has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity in a variety of ways, including through reduced raw materials availability, reduced finished product prices, reduced sales, potential inventory buildup, increased bad debt reserves, potential impairment charges and/or higher operating costs.\nSales prices for the principal products that the Company sells are typically influenced by sales prices for agricultural-based ingredients, the prices of which are based on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes. Any decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity. Any of a decline in raw material availability, a decline in agricultural-based alternative ingredients prices, increases in energy prices or the impact of U.S. and foreign regulation (including, without limitation, China), changes in foreign exchange rates, imposition of currency controls and currency devaluations has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity. A decline in commodities prices, a rise in energy prices, a slowdown in the U.S. or international economy or other factors, could cause the Company to fail to meet management's expectations or could cause liquidity concerns.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the Company's expected material contractual payment obligations, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements at December 28, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations(a):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,608,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>495,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>162,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payable (d)\n</td> <td>418,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (e)\n</td> <td>99,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension funding obligation (f)\n</td> <td>4,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (b)\n</td> <td>62,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,355,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,189,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions at December 28, 2019.

These purchase agreements are entered into in the normal course of the Company's business and are not subject to derivative accounting. The commitments will be recorded on the balance sheet of the Company when delivery of these commodities occurs and ownership passes to the Company during the next two years, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions that may deviate from actual results. In particular, management makes estimates regarding fair value of the Company's reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment of both long-lived assets and goodwill and pension liability. Each of these estimates is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. In fiscal year 2018, the Company shut down the operations at its Hurlingham, Argentina plant and recorded impairment charges related to its long-lived assets of approximately $2.4 million. In fiscal year 2019, no triggering event occurred requiring that the Company perform testing of its long-lived assets for impairment.\nGoodwill Valuation\nThe Company performed the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments at October 26, 2019 and concluded that the Company's goodwill for all reporting units and all recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired as of that date. Goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company follows a two-step process for testing impairment. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the unit's fair value of its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value.\nBased on the Company's annual impairment testing at October 26, 2019, October 27, 2018 and October 28, 2017, the fair values of the Company's reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying value. However, based on the Company's annual impairment testing at October 26, 2019, the fair value of four of the Company's eight reporting units was less than 30% in excess of its carrying value and one reporting unit (Canada Feed) was less than 10% in excess of the estimated fair value with goodwill of approximately $178.6 million, which was substantially less than the percentage by which the other reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values. The Company determined the fair value of reporting units with the assistance of a valuation expert who assisted the Company primarily using the Income Approach to determine the fair value of the Company's reporting units. Key assumptions that impacted the discounted cash flow model were raw material volumes, gross margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. It is possible, depending upon a number of factors that are not determinable at this time or within the control of the Company, that the fair value of these four reporting units could decrease in the future and result in an impairment to goodwill. The amount of goodwill allocated to these four reporting units was approximately $504.0 million. The Company's management believes the biggest risk to these reporting units is decreasing finished product prices impacting gross margins and an economic slowdown that would impact raw material suppliers. Goodwill was approximately $1,223.3 million and $1,229.2 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nPension Liability\nThe Company has retirement and pension plans covering a substantial number of its domestic and foreign employees. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels, mortality rates and trends in health care costs. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.\nThe discount rate applied to the Company's pension liability is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the pension benefit obligation. The weighted average discount rate was 2.77% at December 28, 2019 and 3.68% at December 29, 2018, respectively. The net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020 would increase by approximately $1.2 million if the discount rate was 0.5% lower at a weighted average of 2.27%. The net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020 would decrease by approximately $1.1 million if the discount rate was 0.5% higher at a weighted average of 3.27%.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU amends Topic 740 Income Taxes, which will eliminate certain exceptions in accounting for income taxes, improves consistency in application and clarifies existing guidance. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract. This ASU amends Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Internal - Use Software, which will align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. Implementation should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted the new accounting standard effective December 30, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. This ASU amends Subtopic 715-20, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The standard is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements. This ASU amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvement to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU amends Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies and simplify the application of hedge accounting. The guidance includes certain targeted improvements to ease the operational burden of applying hedge accounting. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company will be required to apply the guidance on a cumulative-effect basis with adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with disclosure on a prospective basis. The Company adopted this ASU on December 30, 2018 and the initial adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU amends Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which will simplify the goodwill impairment calculation by eliminating Step 2 from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under ASU 2016-13, existing guidance on reporting credit losses for trade and other receivables and available for sale debt securities will be replaced with a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The Company adopted the new standard on December 30, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and is using the effective date as the Company's date of initial application and consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the this ASU will not be provided for dates and periods before December 30, 2018. The Company has elected the package of expedients, which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard the Company's prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to the Company.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking\u201d statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words such as estimate,\u201d project,\u201d planned,\u201d contemplate,\u201d potential,\u201d possible,\u201d proposed,\u201d intend,\u201d believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report are forward looking statements, including, without limitation, the statements under the sections entitled Business,\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Legal Proceedings\u201d and located elsewhere herein regarding industry prospects, the Company's financial position and the Company's use of cash. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. The Company cautions readers that any such forward-looking statements it makes are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including many that are beyond the Company's control.\nIn addition to those factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this report and elsewhere in this report, and in the Company's other public filings with the SEC, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations include: existing and unknown future limitations on the ability of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries to make their cash flow available to the Company for payments on the Company's indebtedness or other\npurposes; global demands for bio-fuels and grain and oilseed commodities, which have exhibited volatility, and can impact the cost of feed for cattle, hogs and poultry, thus affecting available rendering feedstock and selling prices for the Company's products; reductions in raw material volumes available to the Company due to weak margins in the meat production industry as a result of higher feed costs, reduced consumer demand or other factors, reduced volume from food service establishments, or otherwise; reduced demand for animal feed; reduced finished product prices, including a decline in fat and used cooking oil finished product prices; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and GHG emissions that adversely affect programs like the U.S. government's renewable fuel standard, low carbon fuel standards ( LCFS\u201d) and tax credits for biofuels both in the United States and abroad; possible product recall resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food or food additives; the occurrence of 2009 H1N1 flu (initially known as Swine Flu), highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as Bird Flu), SARS, BSE, PED or other diseases associated with animal origin in the United States or elsewhere, such as the outbreak of ASF in China and elsewhere; escalation in the outbreak of the coronavirus; unanticipated costs and/or reductions in raw material volumes related to the Company's compliance with the existing or unforeseen new U.S. or foreign (including, without limitation, China) regulations (including new or modified animal feed, Bird Flu, SARS, PED, BSE or ASF or similar or unanticipated regulations) affecting the industries in which the Company operates or its value added products; risks associated with the DGD Joint Venture, including possible unanticipated operating disruptions and issues relating to the announced expansion project; risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protections imposed by foreign countries; difficulties or a significant disruption in the Company's information systems or failure to implement new systems and software successfully, including the Company's ongoing enterprise resource planning project; risks relating to possible third party claims of intellectual property infringement; increased contributions to the Company's pension and benefit plans, including multiemployer and employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans as required by legislation, regulation or other applicable U.S. or foreign law or resulting from a U.S. mass withdrawal event; bad debt writeoffs; loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations; continued or escalated conflict in the Middle East, North Korea, Ukraine or elsewhere; uncertainty regarding the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; and/or unfavorable export or import markets. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, climate conditions, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements included in this report or negatively impact the Company's results of operations. Among other things, future profitability may be affected by the Company's ability to grow its business, which faces competition from companies that may have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company's announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and purchases of shares under the program are subject to market conditions and other factors, which are likely to change from time to time. The Company cautions readers that all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of changes in circumstances, new events or otherwise.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d and in Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d\nFiscal Year 2019 Overview\nThe Company is a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, feed, industrial, fuel, bioenergy and fertilizer industries. With operations on five continents, the Company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into useable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The Company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed and fuel ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the Company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. The Company sells its products domestically and internationally and operates within three industry segments: Feed Ingredients, Food Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients.\nThe Feed Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the collection and processing of beef, poultry and pork animal by-products in North America and Europe into non-food grade oils and protein meals, (ii) the collection and processing of bakery residuals in North America into Cookie Meal\u00ae, which is predominantly used in poultry and swine rations, (iii) the collection and processing of used cooking oil in North America into non-food grade fats, (iv) the collection and processing of porcine and bovine blood in China, Europe, North America and Australia into blood plasma powder and hemoglobin, (v) the processing of selected portions of slaughtered animals into a variety of meat products for use in pet food in Europe and North America, (vi) the processing of cattle hides and hog skins in North America, (vii) the production of organic fertilizers using protein produced from the Company's animal by-products processing activities in North America and Europe, and (viii) the rearing and processing of black soldier fly larvae into specialty proteins for use in animal feed and pet food in North America; and (ix) the provision of grease trap services to food service establishments in North America. Non-food grade oils and fats produced and marketed by the Company are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in animal feed and pet food, as an ingredient for the production of biodiesel and renewable diesel, or to the oleo-chemical industry to be used as an ingredient in a wide variety of industrial applications. Protein meals, blood plasma powder and hemoglobin produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in animal feed, pet food and aquaculture.\nThe Food Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the purchase and processing of beef and pork bone chips, beef hides, pig skins, and fish skins into collagen in Europe, China, South America and North America, (ii) the collection and processing of porcine and bovine intestines into natural casings in Europe, China and North America, (iii) the extraction and processing of porcine mucosa into crude heparin in Europe, (iv) the collection and refining of animal fat into food grade fat in Europe, and (v) the processing of bones to bone chips for the collagen industry and bone ash in Europe. Collagens produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, food, pet food and technical (e.g., photographic) industries. Natural casings produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as an ingredient in the production of sausages and other similar food products.\nThe Fuel Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the Company's share of the results of its equity investment in Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC, a joint venture with Valero Energy Corporation ( Valero\u201d) to convert animal fats, recycled greases, used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, soybean oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable into renewable diesel (the DGD Joint Venture\u201d) as described in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 28, 2019 included herein, (ii) the conversion of animal fats and recycled greases into biodiesel in North America, (iii) the conversion of organic sludge and food waste into biogas in Europe, (iv) the collection and conversion of fallen stock and certain animal by-products pursuant to applicable E.U. regulations into low-grade energy sources to be used in industrial applications, and (v) the processing of manure into natural bio-phosphate in Europe.\nCorporate Activities principally includes unallocated corporate overhead expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense net of interest income, and other non-operating income and expenses.\nOperating Performance Indicators\nThe Company monitors the performance of its business segments using key financial metrics such as results of operations, non-GAAP measurements (Adjusted EBITDA), segment operating income, raw material processed, gross margin percentage, foreign currency translation, and corporate activities. The Company's operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as the fluctuation in energy prices, weather conditions, crop harvests, government policies and programs, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, protein consumption, and global production of competing ingredients. Due to these unpredictable factors that are beyond the control of the Company, forward-looking financial or operational estimates are not provided. The Company is exposed to certain risks associated with a business that is influenced by agricultural-based commodities. These risks are further described in Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company's Feed Ingredients segment animal by-products, bakery residuals, used cooking oil recovery, and blood operations are each influenced by prices for agricultural-based alternative ingredients such as corn oil, soybean oil, soybean meal, and palm oil. In these operations, the costs of the Company's raw materials change with, or in certain cases are indexed to, the selling price or the anticipated selling price of the finished goods produced from the acquired raw materials and/or in some cases, the price spread between various types of finished products. The Company believes that this methodology of procuring raw materials generally establishes a relatively stable gross margin upon the acquisition of the raw material. Although the costs of raw materials for the Feed Ingredients segment are generally based upon actual or anticipated finished goods selling prices, rapid and material changes in finished goods prices, including competing agricultural-based alternative ingredients, generally have an immediate and often times, material impact on the Company's gross margin and profitability resulting from the brief lapse of time between the procurement of the raw materials and the sale of the finished goods. In addition, the volume of raw material volume acquired, which has a direct impact on the amount of finished goods produced, can also have a material effect on the gross margin reported, as the Company has a substantial amount of fixed operating costs.\nThe Company's Food Ingredients segment collagen and natural casings products are influenced by other competing ingredients including plant-based and synthetic hydrocolloids and artificial casings. In the collagen operation, the cost of the Company's animal-based raw material moves in relationship to the selling price of the finished goods. The processing time for the Food Ingredients segment collagen and casings is generally 30 to 60 days, which is substantially longer than the Company's Feed Ingredients segment animal by-products operations. Consequently, the Company's gross margin and profitability in this segment can be influenced by the movement of finished goods prices from the time the raw materials were procured until the finished goods are sold.\nThe Company's Fuel Ingredients segment converts fats into renewable diesel, organic sludge and food waste into biogas, and fallen stock into low-grade energy sources. The Company's gross margin and profitability in this segment are impacted by world energy prices for oil, electricity, natural gas and governmental subsidies.\nThe reporting currency for the Company's financial statements is the U.S. dollar. The Company operates in over 15 countries and therefore, certain of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the Euro, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Polish zloty. To prepare the Company's consolidated financial statements, assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. This could have a significant impact on the Company's results, if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies is substantial.\nIn 2019, the Company continued to evaluate operational developments and the impact of anticipated significant expansion of the DGD Joint Venture. This evaluation was impactful to the consideration of how the Company most appropriately reflects its share of equity income from the DGD Joint Venture. Based on the Company's analysis, it was determined that the DGD Joint Venture has evolved into an integral and integrated part of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company determined this justifies a more meaningful and transparent presentation of equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture as a component of the Company's operating income. As a result, the Company has reclassified its equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture to operating income for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter ended September 28, 2019, the equity in Diamond Green Diesel was presented below the operating income line in the Company's published results. Commencing with the third quarter of 2019, the Company is including its equity in earnings of Diamond Green Diesel in operating income for all periods presented.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nOperating Performance Metrics\nOther operating performance metrics indicators which management routinely monitors as an indicator of operating performance include:\n \u2022 Finished product commodity prices \n \u2022 Segment results \n \u2022 Foreign currency exchange \n \u2022 Corporate activities \n \u2022 Non-U.S. GAAP measures \nThese indicators and their importance are discussed below.\nFinished Product Commodity Prices\nPrices for finished product commodities that the Company produces in the Feed Ingredients segment are reported each business day on the Jacobsen Index (the Jacobsen\u201d), an established North American trading exchange price publisher. The Jacobsen reports industry sales from the prior day's activity by product. Included on the Jacobsen are reported prices for finished products such as MBM, PM and feather meal ( FM\u201d), hides, BFT and YG and corn, which is a substitute commodity for the Company's BBP as well as a range of other branded and value-added products, which are products of the Company's Feed Ingredients segment. In the U.S. the Company regularly monitors the Jacobsen for MBM, PM, FM, BFT, YG and corn because it provides a daily indication of the Company's U.S. revenue performance against business plan benchmarks. In Europe, the Company regularly monitors Thomson Reuters ( Reuters\u201d) to track the competing commodities palm oil and soy meal.\nAlthough the Jacobsen and Reuters provide useful metrics of performance, the Company's finished products are commodities that compete with other commodities such as corn, soybean oil, palm oil complex, soybean meal and heating oil on nutritional and functional values. Therefore, actual pricing for the Company's finished products, as well as competing products, can be quite volatile. In addition, neither the Jacobsen nor Reuters provides forward or future period pricing for the Company's commodities. The Jacobsen and Reuters prices quoted below are for delivery of the finished product at a specified location. Although the Company's prices generally move in concert with reported Jacobsen and Reuters prices, the Company's actual sales prices for its finished products may vary significantly from the Jacobsen and Reuters because of production and delivery timing differences and because the Company's finished products are delivered to multiple locations in different geographic regions which utilize alternative price indexes. In addition, certain of the Company's premium branded finished products may sell at prices that may be higher than the closest product on the related Jacobsen or Reuters index. During fiscal year 2019, the Company's actual sales prices by product trended with the disclosed Jacobsen and Reuters prices.\nAverage Jacobsen and Reuters prices (at the specified delivery point) for fiscal year 2019, compared to average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for fiscal year 2018 are:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Avg.

Bakery net sales were approximately $191.6 million and $180.2 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, and other net sales, which includes trap services, were approximately $49.8 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nThe increase in net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment was primarily due to the following (in millions of dollars):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fats\n</td> <td>Proteins\n</td> <td>Other Rendering\n</td> <td>Total Rendering\n</td> <td>Used Cooking Oil\n</td> <td>Bakery\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,536.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,952.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in sales volumes\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in finished product prices\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) due to currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other change (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>38.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>791.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,543.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,970.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The decrease in other net sales is primarily a result of the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business in May 2018. \nMargins. In the Feed Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 22.9% as compared to 23.3% for fiscal year 2018. The decrease in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to lower protein finished product prices.\nSegment operating income. Feed Ingredients' operating income for fiscal year 2019 was $54.7 million, a decrease of $28.1 million as compared to fiscal year 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in protein finished product sales prices, lower spreads in poultry pet grade products, higher compensation and depreciation and amortization costs from the addition of several new facilities in the U.S.\nFood Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Food Ingredients segment totaled 1.08 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Food Ingredients segment decreased approximately (3.4)%. The decline was primarily due to certain food grade raw materials being diverted directly to the Chinese food markets as a result of ASF.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Food Ingredients segment primarily due to lower food grade bone and fat raw material volumes and therefore lower sales volumes, lower casings sales prices and strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018. These factors were somewhat offset by higher hydrolyzed collagen sales volumes and values.\nMargins. In the Food Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 22.7% as compared to 19.4% for fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily due to improved margins from the growth of the collagen business and the closure of the Argentina collagen plant which more than offset lower casing and edible fat margins.\nSegment operating income. Food Ingredients' operating income was $90.6 million for fiscal year 2019, an increase of $56.8 million or 168.0% as compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily due to improved results in the collagen markets, a gain on sale of assets in China and no restructuring and impairment charges in the current year as compared to fiscal year 2018 when the Company closed its Argentina collagen plant.\nFuel Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Fuel Ingredients segment totaled 1.26 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Fuel Ingredients segment increased approximately 7.2%.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Fuel Ingredients segment primarily due the European business sales that translated to less U.S. dollar sales as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar as well as lower diesel and RIN values in North America.\nMargins. In the Fuel Ingredients segment (exclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 25.3% as compared to 22.2% for fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily related to the fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, as compared to 2017 blenders tax credits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nSegment operating income.The Company's Fuel Ingredients segment operating income (inclusive of the equity contribution from DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2019 was $398.8 million, an increase of $203.7 million or 104.4% as compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to 2017 reinstated blenders tax credits booked in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nForeign Currency\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Euro and Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal year 2018. Using actual results for fiscal year 2019 and the prior year's average foreign currency rates for fiscal year 2018 would result in an increase in operating income of approximately $16.9 million. The average rates assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for fiscal year 2019 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.12 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.75 as compared to the average rate for fiscal year 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nCorporate Activities\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $57.9 million during fiscal year 2019, a $12.1 million increase from $45.8 million during fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate related compensation benefits and other corporate expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $0.5 million to $10.4 million during fiscal year 2019 as compared to $10.9 million during fiscal year 2018. The decrease was due to certain of the Company's corporate assets becoming fully depreciated as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $78.7 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $86.4 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $7.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to an interest rate decrease on the Company's euro and U.S. based senior notes, a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization and a reduction in term loan A and term loan B interest due to lower interest rates and lower debt outstanding as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nDebt Extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs were $12.1 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $23.5 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease was due to lower tender and redemption premiums and write-off of deferred loan costs on the 5.375% Senior Notes as compared to the 4.75% Senior Notes extinguished in fiscal year 2018.\nForeign Currency Losses. Foreign currency losses were $1.3 million during fiscal year 2019, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.4 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease is due primarily to lower losses on the revaluation of non-functional currency liabilities as compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.\nGain (loss) on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries represents a gain incurred in fiscal year 2019 on the sale of the Company's trap business in Canada and a gain on the sale of a foreign consolidated joint venture in Europe. The loss on sale of subsidiaries in fiscal year 2018 represents the loss recorded on the sale of a domestic subsidiary that more than offset a gain recorded on the liquidation of a majority owned foreign joint venture.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense was $6.7 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $7.6 million in fiscal year 2018. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to an increase in insurance proceeds on fire and casualty losses that more than offset an increase in the non-service cost component of pension expense and a reduction of interest income.\nEquity in Net Income in Investment of Other Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This primarily represents the Company's pro rata share of the net income from its foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries other than the DGD Joint Venture that more than offset net losses from a domestic unconsolidated subsidiary.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded income tax expense of $59.5 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $12.0 million of income tax expense recorded in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $47.5 million, which was primarily due to an increase in income from operations before income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 was 15.6% and 10.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2018 and 2019 during 2019 and the relative mix of earnings among jurisdictions with different tax rates. Excluding the impact of the 2018 and 2019 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 27.4%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 during 2018, tax law changes in the Netherlands, and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to deferred tax assets for tax losses that are not expected to be utilized in future years. Excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 34.4%.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance. Since EBITDA (generally, net income plus interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is not calculated identically by all companies, the presentation in this report may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA presentations disclosed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated below and represents, for any relevant period, net income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, (income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, income tax provision, other income/(expense) and equity in net (income)/loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and certain non-cash and other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nAs a result, the Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure to evaluate performance and for other discretionary purposes. In addition to the foregoing, management also uses or will use Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain financial covenants under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes that were outstanding at December 28, 2019. However, the amounts shown below for Adjusted EBITDA differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes, as those definitions permit further adjustments to reflect certain other non-recurring costs, non-cash charges and cash dividends from the DGD Joint Venture. Additionally, the Company evaluates the impact of foreign currency exchange on operating cash flow, which is defined as segment operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization.\nReconciliation of Net Income to (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA and (Non-GAAP) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal Year 2019 As Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 28,\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Darling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>312,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>325,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>78,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>59,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>6,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>12,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss/(gain) on disposal of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>(2,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income of Diamond Green Diesel\n</td> <td>(364,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(159,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss/(income) of other unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>8,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange impact (1)\n</td> <td>16,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Darling plus Darling's share of DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The average rate assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.12 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.75 as compared to the average rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) of $436.9 million, as compared to $431.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2018. The increase is attributable to higher margin collagen in the Feed Ingredients segment.\nOn a Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP) basis, the Company would have generated $453.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $431.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nDGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share) is not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA, the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, or the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP).

In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Feed Ingredients segment totaled 8.60 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Feed Ingredients segment increased approximately 4.4%.\nSales. During the year ended December 29, 2018, net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment were $1,952.6 million as compared to $2,239.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2017, a decrease of approximately $286.9 million. Net sales for fats were approximately $564.7 million and $648.3 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Protein net sales were approximately $842.9 million and $816.1 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Other rendering net sales, which include hides, pet food, and service charges, were approximately $129.3 million and $286.2 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Total rendering net sales were approximately $1,536.9 million and $1,750.6 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Used cooking oil net sales were approximately $166.7 million and $185.5 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Bakery net sales were approximately $180.2 million and $209.8 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 and other sales, which includes trap services, and for 2017 industrial residual services, were approximately $68.8 million and $93.6 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\nThe decrease in net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment was primarily due to the following (in millions of dollars):\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fats\n</td> <td>Proteins\n</td> <td>Other Rendering\n</td> <td>Total Rendering\n</td> <td>Used Cooking Oil\n</td> <td>Bakery\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 30, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>816.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,750.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,239.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in sales volumes\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) in finished product prices\n</td> <td>(85.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(decrease) due to currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freight revenue (1)\n</td> <td>(37.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(57.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(21.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other change (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(152.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(152.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(177.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change\n</td> <td>(83.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(213.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(29.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(286.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales year ended December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,536.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,952.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The decrease in freight revenue represents the impact from adoption of the new revenue standard on current year Feed Segment revenue as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2017. See Note 22 to the Notes for impact on consolidated financial statements. \n(2) The decrease in other rendering net sales was primarily due to the Company's sale of a portion of its interest in a majority owned consolidated subsidiary operating in cattle hides as part of its European operations, which resulted in the foreign subsidiary being deconsolidated and accounted for using the equity method of accounting, effective January 2018. In addition, the decrease in other net sales is due to the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business in May 2018.\nMargins. In the Feed Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 23.3% as compared to 22.1% for fiscal year 2017. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the new revenue standard whereby the Company no longer includes billed freight in revenue, as it did in fiscal year 2017.\nSegment operating income. Feed Ingredients' operating income for fiscal year 2018 was $82.8 million, a decrease of $49.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2017. Segment operating income was down in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to lower finished fat product prices and higher depreciation charges from increased capital expenditures that more than offset increased raw material volumes.\nFood Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Food Ingredients segment totaled 1.11 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Food Ingredients segment decreased approximately (0.2)%.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Food Ingredients segment as a result of the permanent shut down of the Company's Hurlingham, Argentina collagen plant, a more competitive European collagen market and lower edible fat sales prices.\nMargins. In the Food Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 19.4% as compared to 20.5% for fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower margins from European collagen due to lower sales volumes and pressure on margins from export sales, combined with an increase in raw material prices for casings and a decrease in edible fat sales prices.\nSegment operating income. Food Ingredients' operating income was $33.8 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $23.1 million or (40.6)% as compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the restructuring and impairment charges incurred as a result of the Hurlingham, Argentina collagen plant shut down and lower earnings in the European collagen market. The casings business delivered slightly lower earnings in fiscal year 2018 due to an increase of raw material prices as compared to fiscal year 2017. The Company's edible fat prices were lower in fiscal year 2018 as a result of competing fat markets as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nFuel Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Fuel Ingredients segment totaled 1.18 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Fuel Ingredients segment decreased approximately (0.6)%.\nSales. Overall sales increased in the Fuel Ingredients segment primarily due to higher sales volumes at Ecoson and in North America due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 of approximately $12.6 million as compared to no blenders tax credits in the same period in fiscal year 2017.\nMargins. In the Fuel Ingredients segment (exclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 22.2% as compared to 20.8% for fiscal year 2017. This increase was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits in North America recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nSegment operating income. The Company's Fuel Ingredients segment income (inclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2018 was $195.1 million, an increase of $152.9 million or 362.3% as compared to fiscal year 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits in North America recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the lack of blenders tax credits in the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nForeign Currency\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the U.S. dollar weakened against most of the other functional currencies used by the Company's non-domestic operations when compared to fiscal year 2017. Using actual results for fiscal year 2018 and the prior year's average foreign currency rates for fiscal year 2017 would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $8.6 million. The average rates assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for fiscal year 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77 as compared to the average rate for fiscal year 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.13 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nCorporate Activities\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $45.8 million during fiscal year 2018, a $4.4 million decrease from $50.2 million during fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in corporate related compensation benefits and other corporate expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $1.0 million to $10.9 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to $11.9 million during fiscal year 2017. The decrease was due to certain of the Company's corporate assets becoming fully depreciated as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $86.4 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $88.9 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $2.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to an interest rate decrease on the Company's euro based senior notes, a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization and a reduction in other debt interest that more than offset an increase in revolver interest from higher fiscal year 2018 revolver borrowings as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nDebt Extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs were $23.5 million during fiscal year 2018, compared to none for fiscal year 2017. The costs in 2018 were due to tender and redemption premiums and the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the retirement of the 4.75% Senior Notes.\nForeign Currency Losses. Foreign currency losses were $6.4 million during fiscal year 2018, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.9 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease in foreign currency losses was primarily due to reduction in losses on non-designated foreign exchange hedge contracts as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nLoss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Loss on disposal of subsidiaries represents a loss recorded from the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business during fiscal year 2018, that more than offset a gain recorded on the liquidation of a majority owned foreign joint venture in fiscal year 2018, as compared to a loss booked in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the sale of a portion of a majority owned foreign subsidiary.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense was $7.6 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $8.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in other expense for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in non-service cost component of pension expense that more than offset an increase in casualty losses in fiscal year 2018 and a reduction of interest income.\nEquity in Net Income/(loss) of Other Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This primarily represents the Company's pro rata share for fiscal year 2018 net losses of its domestic unconsolidated subsidiary other than the DGD Joint Venture that more than offset net income from foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries as compared to fiscal year 2017, which included net income of foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries that more than offset net losses of the Company's domestic unconsolidated subsidiary.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded income tax expense of $12.0 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $69.2 million of income tax benefit recorded in fiscal year 2017, an increase of $81.2 million, which was primarily due to tax law changes enacted in December 2017 with respect to several of the Company's major tax jurisdictions. Specifically, in fiscal year 2017 a tax benefit of $75.0 million was recorded due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d or U.S. tax reform\u201d) in the United States, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and a tax benefit of $13.9 million was recorded for tax law changes in Belgium and France ( European tax law changes\u201d). The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 was 10.2% and (107.7)%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 during 2018, tax law changes in the Netherlands, and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to deferred tax assets for tax losses that are not expected to be utilized in future years. The biofuel tax incentive expired as of the end of fiscal year 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 34.4%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 differs from the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax reform, European tax law changes, the relative mix of earnings among jurisdictions\nwith different tax rates, and subpart F income. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and European tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 is 30.8%.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nFor a discussion of the reasons the Company's management believes the following Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and the purposes for which the Company's management uses such measures, see Results of Operations - Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 - Non-U.S. GAAP Measures.\u201d\nReconciliation of Net Income to (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA and (Non-GAAP) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal Year 2018 As Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Darling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>321,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>86,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense/(benefit)\n</td> <td>12,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges\n</td> <td>14,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>6,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>7,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>23,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>12,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net (income) of Diamond Green Diesel\n</td> <td>(159,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(28,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss/(income) of other unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>4,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange impact (1)\n</td> <td>(8,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Darling plus Darling's share of DGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The average rate assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77 as compared to the average rate for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.13 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) of $431.4 million, as compared to $443.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. The decrease is attributable to lower earnings in the Feed Ingredients and Food Ingredients segment.\nOn a Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP) basis, the Company would have generated $422.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, as compared to $443.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017.\nDGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share) is not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA, the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, or the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP).

Using the euro and Canadian dollar based debt outstanding at December 29, 2018 and comparing the closing balance sheet rates at December 28, 2019 to those at December 29, 2018, the U.S. dollar debt balances of euro based debt decreased by $16.2 million and the U.S. dollar debt balances of Canadian based debt increased by approximately $0.2 million, at December 28, 2019.

On January 6, 2014, Darling, Darling International Canada Inc. ( Darling Canada\u201d) and Darling International NL Holdings B.V. ( Darling NL\u201d) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), restating its then existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 27, 2013, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other agents from time to time party thereto. Effective December 18, 2017, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) with its lenders to the Amended Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fifth Amendment (i) refinanced the term B loans under the Amended Credit Agreement with new term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million with a maturity date of December 18, 2024; (ii) adjusted the applicable margin pricing on borrowings under the term B loan; (iii) modified certain of the negative covenants to increase the allowances for certain actions, including debt and investments; and (iv) made other updates and changes. Effective December 16, 2016, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) with its lenders to the Amended Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fourth Amendment extended the maturity date of the term A loans and revolving credit facility loans under the Amended Credit Agreement from September 27, 2018 to December 16, 2021. For more information regarding the Amended Credit Agreement see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\n \u2022 As of December 28, 2019, the Company had availability of $911.9 million under the revolving loan facility, taking into account an aggregate of $39.0 million in outstanding borrowings, $45.5 million of ancillary facilities and letters of credit issued of $3.6 million. \n \u2022 As of December 28, 2019, the Company has borrowed all $350.0 million under the term loan A facility and has repaid all $350.0 million, which when repaid, cannot be reborrowed. \n \u2022 As of December 28, 2019, the Company has borrowed all $525.0 million under the terms of the term loan B facility and repaid approximately $30.0 million, which when repaid, cannot be reborrowed. The term loan B facility is repayable in quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant term loan B facility on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year commencing on the last day of each month falling on or after the last day of the first full quarter following December 18, 2017, and continuing until the last day of each quarter period ending immediately prior to December 18, 2024; and one final installment in the amount of the relevant term loan B facility then outstanding, due on December 18, 2024. The term loan B facility will mature on December 18, 2024. \n \u2022 The interest rate applicable to any borrowings under the term loan B facility will equal the base rate plus 1.00% or LIBOR plus 2.00%. \n5.25% Senior Notes due 2027. On April 3, 2019, Darling issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 5.25% Notes\u201d). The 5.25% Notes, which were offered in a private offering, were issued pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of April 3, 2019 (the 5.25% Indenture\u201d), among Darling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, and Regions Bank, as trustee. The gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance all of the Company's formerly outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 5.375% Notes\u201d), by cash tender offer for and redemption of all of the Company's then-outstanding 5.375% Notes, to pay the discount of the initial purchasers and to pay other fees and expenses related to the offering of the 5.25% Notes. The refinancing of the 5.375% Notes was completed in the second quarter of 2019. For a description of the terms of the 5.25% Notes see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n3.625 % Senior Notes due 2026. On May 2, 2018, Darling Global Finance B.V. issued and sold \u20ac515 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 3.625% Notes\u201d). The 3.625% Notes, which were offered in a private offering, were issued pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of May 2, 2018, among Darling Global Finance B.V., Darling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee and principal paying agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Deutschland AG, as principal registrar. The gross proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, were used to refinance all of the then Company's formerly outstanding 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 4.75% Notes\u201d) by cash tender offer and redemption of those notes and to pay any applicable premiums for the refinancing, to pay the commission of the initial purchasers of the 3.625% Notes and to pay the other fees and expenses related to the offering. The refinancing of the 4.75% Notes was completed in the second quarter of 2018. For a description of the terms of the 3.625% Notes see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther debt consists of U.S., Canadian and European ancillary and overdraft facilities and capital lease obligations and note arrangements in Brazil, China and Europe that are not part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, 5.25% Notes or 3.625% Notes.\nThe classification of long-term debt in the Company's December 28, 2019 consolidated balance sheet is based on the contractual repayment terms of the 5.25% Notes, the 3.625% Notes and debt issued under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of the Company's borrowings under its Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture, the Company is highly leveraged. Investors should note that, in order to make scheduled payments on the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, and otherwise, the Company will rely in part on a combination of dividends, distributions and intercompany loan repayments from the Company's direct and indirect U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The Company is prohibited under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture from entering (or allowing such subsidiaries to enter) into contractual limitations on the Company's subsidiaries' ability to declare dividends or make other payments or distributions to the Company. The Company has also attempted to structure the Company's consolidated indebtedness in such a way as to maximize the Company's ability to move cash from the Company's subsidiaries to Darling or another subsidiary that will have fewer limitations on the ability to make upstream payments, whether to Darling or directly to the Company's lenders as a Guarantor. Nevertheless, applicable laws under which the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries are formed may provide limitations on such dividends, distributions and other payments. In addition, regulatory authorities in various countries where the Company operates or where the Company imports or exports products may from time to time impose import/export limitations, foreign exchange controls or currency devaluations that may limit the Company's access to profits from the Company's subsidiaries or otherwise negatively impact the Company's financial condition and therefore reduce the Company's ability to make required payments under Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, or otherwise. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange values may have a negative impact on the Company's ability to repay indebtedness denominated in U.S. or Canadian dollars or euros. See Risk Factors - Our business may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, which could affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants\u201d and - Our ability to repay our indebtedness depends in part on the performance of our subsidiaries, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and their ability to make payments\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.\nAs of December 28, 2019, the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, as well as all of the other covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture.\nWorking Capital and Capital Expenditures\nOn December 28, 2019, the Company had working capital of $228.9 million and its working capital ratio was 1.33 to 1 compared to working capital of $357.4 million and a working capital ratio of 1.66 to 1 on December 29, 2018. At December 28, 2019, the Company had unrestricted cash of $72.9 million and funds available under the revolving credit facility of $911.9 million, compared to unrestricted cash of $107.3 million and funds available under the revolving credit facility of $929.8 million at December 29, 2018. The Company diversifies its cash investments by limiting the amounts deposited with any one financial institution and invests primarily in government-backed securities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $362.6 million and $398.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, a decrease of $36.0 million due primarily to an increase in net income that was mostly offset by equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture and to changes in operating assets and liabilities that include a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of approximately $19.8 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and inventory of $41.5 million, a decrease in other of approximately $8.8 million, an increase in income taxes refundable/payable of approximately $19.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expense of approximately $17.9 million. Cash used by investing activities was $338.1 million during fiscal year 2019, compared to $342.4 million in fiscal year 2018, a decrease in cash used of $4.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets that was more than offset by an increase in cash received from insurance. Net cash used by financing activities was $54.9 million during fiscal year 2019, compared to $47.6 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase in cash used of $7.3 million, primarily due to purchases of common stock that more than offset a decrease in debt payments as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nCapital expenditures of $359.5 million were made during fiscal year 2019 as compared to $321.9 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $37.6 million, or 11.7%. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures for expansion in fiscal 2019. In fiscal year 2020, the Company expects to incur approximately $236.0 million in maintenance and compliance type capital expenditures and approximately $70.0 million for new construction (including expansions) for a total of approximately $306.0 million. These costs are expected to be financed using cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations were $37.4 million in fiscal year 2019, $32.1 million in fiscal year 2018 and $27.5 million in fiscal year 2017.\nAccrued Insurance and Pension Plan Obligations\nBased upon the annual actuarial estimate, current accruals and claims paid during fiscal year 2019, the Company has accrued approximately $9.7 million as of December 28, 2019 that it expects will become due during the next twelve months in order to meet obligations related to the Company's self insurance reserves and accrued insurance obligations, which are included in current accrued expenses at December 28, 2019. The self insurance reserve is composed of estimated liability for claims arising for workers' compensation and for auto liability and general liability claims. The self insurance reserve liability is determined annually, based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The actuarial estimate may vary from year to year, due to changes in costs of health care, the pending number of claims and other factors beyond the control of management of the Company.\nBased upon current actuarial estimates, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $0.9 million in order to meet minimum pension funding requirements to its domestic plans in fiscal year 2020. In addition, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $3.4 million under its foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2020. The minimum pension funding requirements are determined annually, based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The actuarial estimate may vary from year to year, due to fluctuations in return on investments or other factors beyond the control of management of the Company or the administrator of the Company's pension funds. No assurance can be given that the minimum pension funding requirements will not increase in the future. The Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its domestic pension plans in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 of approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2019 of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to $3.5 million in contributions in fiscal year 2018.\nThe U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( PPA\u201d) went into effect in January 2008. The stated goal of the PPA is to improve the funding of U.S. pension plans. U.S. plans in an under-funded status are required to increase employer contributions to improve the funding level within PPA timelines. Volatility in the world equity and other financial markets could have a material negative impact on U.S. pension plan assets and the status of required funding under the PPA. The Company participates in various U.S. multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. The Company's contributions to each individual U.S. multiemployer plan represent less than 5% of the total contributions to each such plan. Based on the most currently available information, the Company has determined that, if a withdrawal were to occur, withdrawal liabilities on two of the U.S. plans in which the Company\ncurrently participates could be material to the Company, with one of these material plans certified as critical or red zone. With respect to the other U.S. multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates and which are not individually significant, five plans have certified as critical or red zone and two have certified as endangered or yellow zone, as defined by the PPA. The Company has received notices of withdrawal liability from five U.S. multiemployer pension plans in which it participated. As a result, the Company has an accrued aggregate current liability of approximately $6.0 million representing the present value of scheduled withdrawal liability payments under these multiemployer plans. While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multiemployer plans that could terminate or could require additional funding under the PPA, the amounts could be material.\nDGD Joint Venture\nThe Company announced on January 21, 2011 that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darling entered into a limited liability company agreement with Valero to form the DGD Joint Venture. The DGD Joint Venture is owned 50% / 50% with Valero and was formed to design, engineer, construct and operate the DGD Facility, which as a result of its recently expanded capacity is now capable of processing approximately 20,000 barrels per day of input feedstock to produce renewable diesel fuel and certain other co-products, and is located adjacent to Valero's refinery in Norco, Louisiana. The DGD Joint Venture reached mechanical completion and began the production of renewable diesel in late June 2013. Effective May 1, 2019, the DGD LLC Agreement was amended and restated for the purpose of updating the agreement in certain respects, including to remove certain provisions that were no longer relevant and to add new provisions relating to the DGD Joint Venture's recently approved expansion project to construct a new, parallel facility located next to the current facility, as further described below.\nOn May 1, 2019, Darling, through its wholly owned subsidiary Darling Green Energy LLC, ( Darling Green\u201d), and Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero ( Diamond Alternative\u201d and together with Darling Green, the DGD Lenders\u201d) entered into a revolving loan agreement (the DGD Loan Agreement\u201d) with the DGD Joint Venture. The DGD Lenders have committed to make loans available to the DGD Joint Venture in the total amount of $50.0 million with each lender committed to $25.0 million of the total commitment. Any borrowings by the DGD Joint Venture under the DGD Loan Agreement are at the applicable annum rate equal to the sum of (a) the LIBO Rate (meaning Reuters BBA Libor Rates Page 3750) on such day plus (b) 2.50%. The DGD Loan Agreement matures on April 29, 2020, unless extended by agreement of the parties. The DGD Loan Agreement replaces a similar agreement with lower commitment levels that expired on December 31, 2018. As of December 28, 2019, no amounts are owed to the DGD Lenders under the DGD Loan Agreement.\nBased on the sponsor support agreements executed in connection with the initial construction of the DGD Facility, the Company contributed a total of approximately $111.7 million for completion of the DGD Facility including the Company's portion of cost overruns and working capital funding. As of December 28, 2019, under the equity method of accounting the Company has an investment in the DGD Joint Venture of approximately $661.5 million included on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn August 2018, the DGD Joint Venture completed an expansion project that increased the DGD Facility's annual production capacity from 160 million gallons of renewable diesel to 275 million gallons and expanded outbound logistics for servicing the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. In November 2018, the joint venture partners approved the DGD Joint Venture moving forward with another expansion project to construct a new, parallel facility (the New Facility\u201d) located next to the current facility. The New Facility is expected to grow the DGD Joint Venture's annual production capacity by an additional 400 million gallons from the current capacity of 275 million gallons of renewable diesel to 675 million gallons of renewable diesel and provide the capability to separate naphtha for sale into low carbon fuel markets. In addition, the expansion project includes further expanded inbound and outbound logistics for servicing the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. The DGD Joint Venture estimates completion and startup of the New Facility in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the total cost of the expansion project, including the naphtha production and improved logistics capability, is estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Based on forecasted margins as of the date of this report, the expansion project is expected to be substantially funded by DGD Joint Venture cash flow; however, the DGD LLC Agreement provides that until such time as the New Facility is complete and operational, the joint venture partners shall be required to make capital contributions or, if they agree, loans, to the DGD Joint Venture should the excess available cash in the DGD Joint Venture, as determined on specified dates and in accordance with the provisions contained in the DGD LLC Agreement, fall below $50 million.\nIn April 2019, the joint venture partners adopted a distribution policy that, unless earlier terminated by the partners, will remain in place through the construction and completion of the New Facility. Pursuant to the distribution policy, the DGD Joint Venture will make quarterly distributions to the partners to the extent that distributable cash (as determined in accordance with the policy) exceeds $50 million and as allowed by the DGD Joint Venture's forward looking cash forecast. During the year ended December 28, 2019, the DGD Joint Venture made approximately $67.5 million distributions to each of the partners.\nThe Company's original investment in DGD has expanded since 2011 to the point that it is now integral to how Darling operates its business. Darling traditionally collected and converted used cooking oil and animal fats into feed ingredients which were sold on a caloric value to feed animals as well as for industrial technical uses. Over the past decade, the world's increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas has provided a new finished market for the Company's finished fats ingredients. With Darling's significant fats ownership, this has and continues to transform how Darling operates. In 2018, a large portion of Darling's total U.S. finished fats products were sold to the DGD Facility as feedstock for renewable diesel. This percentage is expected to noticeably increase both in 2019 and beyond due to the recent DGD capacity expansion completed in August 2018 and the even larger expansion to be finished in late 2021. In 2019 and 2018, DGD was Darling's largest finished product customer in terms of sales, with Darling recording sales of $208.7 million and $131.8 million to DGD, respectively.\nFrom a procurement, production and distribution standpoint, DGD has become integral to Darling's base business. DGD is integral to the Company's operations via the combined vertical operating structure from collecting raw fats, to processing collected fats at Darling facilities nationwide to transporting the refined fats to the DGD facility as feedstock. The Darling supply chain has become more efficient and sustainable with transparency for verification to obtain full value to low carbon intensity markets. The development of the low carbon markets in North America and Europe has influenced how Darling operates its core business and has also been a driver for the recent DGD expansions, which are making DGD much more relevant to Darling's earnings. Since 2011 when construction began on DGD, Darling has invested substantially to increase its U.S. railcar fleet to efficiently manage nationwide transportation of Darling fats to DGD. Additionally, Darling acquired an Iowa location on the Mississippi River that further enhances the ability of the Company's Midwest network of facilities to collect and deliver feedstocks to DGD via water, rail or truck from a centralized location. Darling has also stepped up collection efforts by providing indoor used cooking oil collection units in exchange for extended collection contracts at eating establishments and has moved to more of a centralized digital marketing effort with restaurant chains and franchise groups and invested in internet search engine key words to improve visibility with restaurants. The Company also includes DGD in marketing efforts to emphasize environmental sustainability that restaurants participate in when their used cooking oil is collected by Darling. From a production standpoint, Darling now isolates used cooking oil from other fats to preserve identification to qualify for a higher carbon intensity value. As a result, the Company has reclassified its equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture to operating income for all periods presented.\nIn September 2019, the Company announced that the DGD Joint Venture was initiating an advanced engineering and development cost review for construction of a new renewable diesel plant to be located in Port Arthur, Texas. The proposed facility under review would be designed to produce 400 million gallons of renewable diesel annually as well as 40 million gallons of renewable naphtha. The final investment decision on the project is expected in 2021, subject to further engineering, obtaining necessary permits, and approval by the boards of the Company and Valero. If the decision is made to move forward, new plant construction could begin in 2021, with expected operations commencing in 2024.\nFinancial Impact of Significant Debt Outstanding\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our financial lenders and our contractual and commercial commitments, limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows from operations available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and business conditions, expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors, and/or increase our cost of borrowing.\nCash Flows and Liquidity Risks\nManagement believes that the Company's cash flows from operating activities consistent with the level generated in fiscal year 2019, unrestricted cash and funds available under the Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet the Company's working capital needs and maintenance and compliance-related capital expenditures, scheduled debt and interest payments, income tax obligations, and other contemplated needs through the next twelve months. Numerous factors could have adverse consequences to the Company that cannot be estimated at this time, such as those factors discussed below under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could negatively impact the Company's results of operations in fiscal year 2020 and thereafter. The Company reviews the appropriate use of unrestricted cash periodically. As of the date of this\nreport, no decision has been made as to non-ordinary course material cash usages at this time; however, potential usages could include: opportunistic capital expenditures and/or acquisitions and joint ventures; investments relating to the Company's renewable energy strategy, including, without limitation, potential required funding obligations with respect to the DGD Joint Venture expansion project or potential investments in additional renewable diesel and/or biodiesel projects; investments in response to governmental regulations relating to human and animal food safety or other regulations; unexpected funding required by the legislation, regulation or mass termination of multiemployer plans; and paying dividends or repurchasing stock, subject to limitations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, as well as suitable cash conservation to withstand adverse commodity cycles. In August 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock depending on market conditions. On August 7, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the extension for an additional two years of its previously announced share repurchase program and refreshed the amount of the program back up to its original amount of an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock depending on market conditions. To that point, the Company had previously repurchased $10.9 million shares of its Common stock under the program. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. On November 6, 2018, the Board approved an increase in the share repurchase program from $100.0 million to $200.0 million and extended the term of the program for an additional year to August 13, 2020. Repurchases may occur through August 13, 2020, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors. Since the inception of the share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased approximately $30.1 million of its common stock in open market purchases and, as of the date of this report, has $180.8 million remaining in its share repurchase program.\nEach of the factors described above has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity in a variety of ways, including through reduced raw materials availability, reduced finished product prices, reduced sales, potential inventory buildup, increased bad debt reserves, potential impairment charges and/or higher operating costs.\nSales prices for the principal products that the Company sells are typically influenced by sales prices for agricultural-based ingredients, the prices of which are based on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes. Any decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity. Any of a decline in raw material availability, a decline in agricultural-based alternative ingredients prices, increases in energy prices or the impact of U.S. and foreign regulation (including, without limitation, China), changes in foreign exchange rates, imposition of currency controls and currency devaluations has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity. A decline in commodities prices, a rise in energy prices, a slowdown in the U.S. or international economy or other factors, could cause the Company to fail to meet management's expectations or could cause liquidity concerns.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the Company's expected material contractual payment obligations, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements at December 28, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations(a):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,608,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>495,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>162,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payable (d)\n</td> <td>418,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (e)\n</td> <td>99,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension funding obligation (f)\n</td> <td>4,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (b)\n</td> <td>62,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,355,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,189,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) The above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions at December 28, 2019.

The Company expects to make approximately $4.8 million in required contributions to domestic and foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2020. The Company is not able to estimate pension funding requirements beyond the next twelve months. The accrued pension benefit liability was approximately $56.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2019. The Company knows certain of the multiemployer pension plans that have not terminated to which it contributes and which are not administered by the Company were under-funded as of the latest available information, and while the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for the under-funded multiemployer plan to which the Company contributes, the amounts could be material. \nThe Company's off-balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 28, 2019 relate to letters of credit, foreign bank guarantees, forward purchase agreements and employment agreements. The Company has excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's other commercial commitments, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements that are part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement and other foreign bank guarantees that are not a part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement at December 28, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commercial commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit (ancillary facility)\n</td> <td>20,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign bank guarantees\n</td> <td>11,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other commercial commitments:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOFF BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS\nBased upon the underlying purchase agreements, the Company has commitments to purchase $95.7 million of commodity products, consisting of approximately $52.2 million of finished and raw material products and approximately $43.5 million of natural gas and diesel fuel commitments during the next two years, which are not included in liabilities on the Company's balance sheet at December 28, 2019. These purchase agreements are entered into in the normal course of the Company's business and are not subject to derivative accounting. The commitments will be recorded on the balance sheet of the Company when delivery of these commodities occurs and ownership passes to the Company during the next two years, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions that may deviate from actual results. In particular, management makes estimates regarding fair value of the Company's reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment of both long-lived assets and goodwill and pension liability. Each of these estimates is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. In fiscal year 2018, the Company shut down the operations at its Hurlingham, Argentina plant and recorded impairment charges related to its long-lived assets of approximately $2.4 million. In fiscal year 2019, no triggering event occurred requiring that the Company perform testing of its long-lived assets for impairment.\nGoodwill Valuation\nThe Company performed the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments at October 26, 2019 and concluded that the Company's goodwill for all reporting units and all recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired as of that date. Goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company follows a two-step process for testing impairment. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the unit's fair value of its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value.\nBased on the Company's annual impairment testing at October 26, 2019, October 27, 2018 and October 28, 2017, the fair values of the Company's reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying value. However, based on the Company's annual impairment testing at October 26, 2019, the fair value of four of the Company's eight reporting units was less than 30% in excess of its carrying value and one reporting unit (Canada Feed) was less than 10% in excess of the estimated fair value with goodwill of approximately $178.6 million, which was substantially less than the percentage by which the other reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values. The Company determined the fair value of reporting units with the assistance of a valuation expert who assisted the Company primarily using the Income Approach to determine the fair value of the Company's reporting units. Key assumptions that impacted the discounted cash flow model were raw material volumes, gross margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. It is possible, depending upon a number of factors that are not determinable at this time or within the control of the Company, that the fair value of these four reporting units could decrease in the future and result in an impairment to goodwill. The amount of goodwill allocated to these four reporting units was approximately $504.0 million. The Company's management believes the biggest risk to these reporting units is decreasing finished product prices impacting gross margins and an economic slowdown that would impact raw material suppliers. Goodwill was approximately $1,223.3 million and $1,229.2 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nPension Liability\nThe Company has retirement and pension plans covering a substantial number of its domestic and foreign employees. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels, mortality rates and trends in health care costs. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.\nThe discount rate applied to the Company's pension liability is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the pension benefit obligation. The weighted average discount rate was 2.77% at December 28, 2019 and 3.68% at December 29, 2018, respectively. The net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020 would increase by approximately $1.2 million if the discount rate was 0.5% lower at a weighted average of 2.27%. The net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020 would decrease by approximately $1.1 million if the discount rate was 0.5% higher at a weighted average of 3.27%.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU amends Topic 740 Income Taxes, which will eliminate certain exceptions in accounting for income taxes, improves consistency in application and clarifies existing guidance. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract. This ASU amends Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Internal - Use Software, which will align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. Implementation should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted the new accounting standard effective December 30, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. This ASU amends Subtopic 715-20, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The standard is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements. This ASU amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvement to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU amends Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies and simplify the application of hedge accounting. The guidance includes certain targeted improvements to ease the operational burden of applying hedge accounting. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company will be required to apply the guidance on a cumulative-effect basis with adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with disclosure on a prospective basis. The Company adopted this ASU on December 30, 2018 and the initial adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU amends Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which will simplify the goodwill impairment calculation by eliminating Step 2 from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under ASU 2016-13, existing guidance on reporting credit losses for trade and other receivables and available for sale debt securities will be replaced with a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The Company adopted the new standard on December 30, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and is using the effective date as the Company's date of initial application and consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the this ASU will not be provided for dates and periods before December 30, 2018. The Company has elected the package of expedients, which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard the Company's prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to the Company.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking\u201d statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words such as estimate,\u201d project,\u201d planned,\u201d contemplate,\u201d potential,\u201d possible,\u201d proposed,\u201d intend,\u201d believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report are forward looking statements, including, without limitation, the statements under the sections entitled Business,\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Legal Proceedings\u201d and located elsewhere herein regarding industry prospects, the Company's financial position and the Company's use of cash. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. The Company cautions readers that any such forward-looking statements it makes are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including many that are beyond the Company's control.\nIn addition to those factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this report and elsewhere in this report, and in the Company's other public filings with the SEC, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations include: existing and unknown future limitations on the ability of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries to make their cash flow available to the Company for payments on the Company's indebtedness or other\npurposes; global demands for bio-fuels and grain and oilseed commodities, which have exhibited volatility, and can impact the cost of feed for cattle, hogs and poultry, thus affecting available rendering feedstock and selling prices for the Company's products; reductions in raw material volumes available to the Company due to weak margins in the meat production industry as a result of higher feed costs, reduced consumer demand or other factors, reduced volume from food service establishments, or otherwise; reduced demand for animal feed; reduced finished product prices, including a decline in fat and used cooking oil finished product prices; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and GHG emissions that adversely affect programs like the U.S. government's renewable fuel standard, low carbon fuel standards ( LCFS\u201d) and tax credits for biofuels both in the United States and abroad; possible product recall resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food or food additives; the occurrence of 2009 H1N1 flu (initially known as Swine Flu), highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as Bird Flu), SARS, BSE, PED or other diseases associated with animal origin in the United States or elsewhere, such as the outbreak of ASF in China and elsewhere; escalation in the outbreak of the coronavirus; unanticipated costs and/or reductions in raw material volumes related to the Company's compliance with the existing or unforeseen new U.S. or foreign (including, without limitation, China) regulations (including new or modified animal feed, Bird Flu, SARS, PED, BSE or ASF or similar or unanticipated regulations) affecting the industries in which the Company operates or its value added products; risks associated with the DGD Joint Venture, including possible unanticipated operating disruptions and issues relating to the announced expansion project; risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protections imposed by foreign countries; difficulties or a significant disruption in the Company's information systems or failure to implement new systems and software successfully, including the Company's ongoing enterprise resource planning project; risks relating to possible third party claims of intellectual property infringement; increased contributions to the Company's pension and benefit plans, including multiemployer and employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans as required by legislation, regulation or other applicable U.S. or foreign law or resulting from a U.S. mass withdrawal event; bad debt writeoffs; loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations; continued or escalated conflict in the Middle East, North Korea, Ukraine or elsewhere; uncertainty regarding the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; and/or unfavorable export or import markets. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, climate conditions, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements included in this report or negatively impact the Company's results of operations. Among other things, future profitability may be affected by the Company's ability to grow its business, which faces competition from companies that may have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company's announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and purchases of shares under the program are subject to market conditions and other factors, which are likely to change from time to time. The Company cautions readers that all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of changes in circumstances, new events or otherwise.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d and in Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d\nFiscal Year 2019 Overview\nThe Company is a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, feed, industrial, fuel, bioenergy and fertilizer industries. With operations on five continents, the Company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into useable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The Company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed and fuel ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the Company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. The Company sells its products domestically and internationally and operates within three industry segments: Feed Ingredients, Food Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients.\nThe Feed Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the collection and processing of beef, poultry and pork animal by-products in North America and Europe into non-food grade oils and protein meals, (ii) the collection and processing of bakery residuals in North America into Cookie Meal\u00ae, which is predominantly used in poultry and swine rations, (iii) the collection and processing of used cooking oil in North America into non-food grade fats, (iv) the collection and processing of porcine and bovine blood in China, Europe, North America and Australia into blood plasma powder and hemoglobin, (v) the processing of selected portions of slaughtered animals into a variety of meat products for use in pet food in Europe and North America, (vi) the processing of cattle hides and hog skins in North America, (vii) the production of organic fertilizers using protein produced from the Company's animal by-products processing activities in North America and Europe, and (viii) the rearing and processing of black soldier fly larvae into specialty proteins for use in animal feed and pet food in North America; and (ix) the provision of grease trap services to food service establishments in North America. Non-food grade oils and fats produced and marketed by the Company are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in animal feed and pet food, as an ingredient for the production of biodiesel and renewable diesel, or to the oleo-chemical industry to be used as an ingredient in a wide variety of industrial applications. Protein meals, blood plasma powder and hemoglobin produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in animal feed, pet food and aquaculture.\nThe Food Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the purchase and processing of beef and pork bone chips, beef hides, pig skins, and fish skins into collagen in Europe, China, South America and North America, (ii) the collection and processing of porcine and bovine intestines into natural casings in Europe, China and North America, (iii) the extraction and processing of porcine mucosa into crude heparin in Europe, (iv) the collection and refining of animal fat into food grade fat in Europe, and (v) the processing of bones to bone chips for the collagen industry and bone ash in Europe. Collagens produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, food, pet food and technical (e.g., photographic) industries. Natural casings produced and marketed by the Company are sold to third parties to be used as an ingredient in the production of sausages and other similar food products.\nThe Fuel Ingredients operating segment includes the Company's global activities related to (i) the Company's share of the results of its equity investment in Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC, a joint venture with Valero Energy Corporation ( Valero\u201d) to convert animal fats, recycled greases, used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, soybean oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable into renewable diesel (the DGD Joint Venture\u201d) as described in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 28, 2019 included herein, (ii) the conversion of animal fats and recycled greases into biodiesel in North America, (iii) the conversion of organic sludge and food waste into biogas in Europe, (iv) the collection and conversion of fallen stock and certain animal by-products pursuant to applicable E.U. regulations into low-grade energy sources to be used in industrial applications, and (v) the processing of manure into natural bio-phosphate in Europe.\nCorporate Activities principally includes unallocated corporate overhead expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense net of interest income, and other non-operating income and expenses.\nOperating Performance Indicators\nThe Company monitors the performance of its business segments using key financial metrics such as results of operations, non-GAAP measurements (Adjusted EBITDA), segment operating income, raw material processed, gross margin percentage, foreign currency translation, and corporate activities. The Company's operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as the fluctuation in energy prices, weather conditions, crop harvests, government policies and programs, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, protein consumption, and global production of competing ingredients. Due to these unpredictable factors that are beyond the control of the Company, forward-looking financial or operational estimates are not provided. The Company is exposed to certain risks associated with a business that is influenced by agricultural-based commodities. These risks are further described in Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company's Feed Ingredients segment animal by-products, bakery residuals, used cooking oil recovery, and blood operations are each influenced by prices for agricultural-based alternative ingredients such as corn oil, soybean oil, soybean meal, and palm oil. In these operations, the costs of the Company's raw materials change with, or in certain cases are indexed to, the selling price or the anticipated selling price of the finished goods produced from the acquired raw materials and/or in some cases, the price spread between various types of finished products. The Company believes that this methodology of procuring raw materials generally establishes a relatively stable gross margin upon the acquisition of the raw material. Although the costs of raw materials for the Feed Ingredients segment are generally based upon actual or anticipated finished goods selling prices, rapid and material changes in finished goods prices, including competing agricultural-based alternative ingredients, generally have an immediate and often times, material impact on the Company's gross margin and profitability resulting from the brief lapse of time between the procurement of the raw materials and the sale of the finished goods. In addition, the volume of raw material volume acquired, which has a direct impact on the amount of finished goods produced, can also have a material effect on the gross margin reported, as the Company has a substantial amount of fixed operating costs.\nThe Company's Food Ingredients segment collagen and natural casings products are influenced by other competing ingredients including plant-based and synthetic hydrocolloids and artificial casings. In the collagen operation, the cost of the Company's animal-based raw material moves in relationship to the selling price of the finished goods. The processing time for the Food Ingredients segment collagen and casings is generally 30 to 60 days, which is substantially longer than the Company's Feed Ingredients segment animal by-products operations. Consequently, the Company's gross margin and profitability in this segment can be influenced by the movement of finished goods prices from the time the raw materials were procured until the finished goods are sold.\nThe Company's Fuel Ingredients segment converts fats into renewable diesel, organic sludge and food waste into biogas, and fallen stock into low-grade energy sources. The Company's gross margin and profitability in this segment are impacted by world energy prices for oil, electricity, natural gas and governmental subsidies.\nThe reporting currency for the Company's financial statements is the U.S. dollar. The Company operates in over 15 countries and therefore, certain of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the Euro, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Polish zloty. To prepare the Company's consolidated financial statements, assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. This could have a significant impact on the Company's results, if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies is substantial.\nIn 2019, the Company continued to evaluate operational developments and the impact of anticipated significant expansion of the DGD Joint Venture. This evaluation was impactful to the consideration of how the Company most appropriately reflects its share of equity income from the DGD Joint Venture. Based on the Company's analysis, it was determined that the DGD Joint Venture has evolved into an integral and integrated part of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company determined this justifies a more meaningful and transparent presentation of equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture as a component of the Company's operating income. As a result, the Company has reclassified its equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture to operating income for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter ended September 28, 2019, the equity in Diamond Green Diesel was presented below the operating income line in the Company's published results. Commencing with the third quarter of 2019, the Company is including its equity in earnings of Diamond Green Diesel in operating income for all periods presented.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nOperating Performance Metrics\nOther operating performance metrics indicators which management routinely monitors as an indicator of operating performance include:\n \u2022 Finished product commodity prices \n \u2022 Segment results \n \u2022 Foreign currency exchange \n \u2022 Corporate activities \n \u2022 Non-U.S. GAAP measures \nThese indicators and their importance are discussed below.\nFinished Product Commodity Prices\nPrices for finished product commodities that the Company produces in the Feed Ingredients segment are reported each business day on the Jacobsen Index (the Jacobsen\u201d), an established North American trading exchange price publisher. The Jacobsen reports industry sales from the prior day's activity by product. Included on the Jacobsen are reported prices for finished products such as MBM, PM and feather meal ( FM\u201d), hides, BFT and YG and corn, which is a substitute commodity for the Company's BBP as well as a range of other branded and value-added products, which are products of the Company's Feed Ingredients segment. In the U.S. the Company regularly monitors the Jacobsen for MBM, PM, FM, BFT, YG and corn because it provides a daily indication of the Company's U.S. revenue performance against business plan benchmarks. In Europe, the Company regularly monitors Thomson Reuters ( Reuters\u201d) to track the competing commodities palm oil and soy meal.\nAlthough the Jacobsen and Reuters provide useful metrics of performance, the Company's finished products are commodities that compete with other commodities such as corn, soybean oil, palm oil complex, soybean meal and heating oil on nutritional and functional values. Therefore, actual pricing for the Company's finished products, as well as competing products, can be quite volatile. In addition, neither the Jacobsen nor Reuters provides forward or future period pricing for the Company's commodities. The Jacobsen and Reuters prices quoted below are for delivery of the finished product at a specified location. Although the Company's prices generally move in concert with reported Jacobsen and Reuters prices, the Company's actual sales prices for its finished products may vary significantly from the Jacobsen and Reuters because of production and delivery timing differences and because the Company's finished products are delivered to multiple locations in different geographic regions which utilize alternative price indexes. In addition, certain of the Company's premium branded finished products may sell at prices that may be higher than the closest product on the related Jacobsen or Reuters index. During fiscal year 2019, the Company's actual sales prices by product trended with the disclosed Jacobsen and Reuters prices.\nAverage Jacobsen and Reuters prices (at the specified delivery point) for fiscal year 2019, compared to average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for fiscal year 2018 are:\n\nThe following table shows the average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, compared to the average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.\n\nSegment Results\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 was $475.8 million, which reflects an increase of $220.8 million or 86.6% as compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.\n\n\nFeed Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Feed Ingredients segment totaled 8.74 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Feed Ingredients segment increased approximately 1.7%.\nSales. During the year ended December 28, 2019, net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment were $1,970.6 million as compared to $1,952.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2018, an increase of approximately $18.0 million. Net sales for fats were approximately $584.3 million and $564.7 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Protein net sales were approximately $791.3 million and $842.9 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Other rendering net sales, which include hides, pet food, and service charges, were approximately $167.9 million and $129.3 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Total rendering net sales were approximately $1,543.5 million and $1,536.9 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Used cooking oil net sales were approximately $185.7 million and $166.7 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Bakery net sales were approximately $191.6 million and $180.2 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, and other net sales, which includes trap services, were approximately $49.8 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nThe increase in net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment was primarily due to the following (in millions of dollars):\n\n (1) The decrease in other net sales is primarily a result of the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business in May 2018. \nMargins. In the Feed Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 22.9% as compared to 23.3% for fiscal year 2018. The decrease in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to lower protein finished product prices.\nSegment operating income. Feed Ingredients' operating income for fiscal year 2019 was $54.7 million, a decrease of $28.1 million as compared to fiscal year 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in protein finished product sales prices, lower spreads in poultry pet grade products, higher compensation and depreciation and amortization costs from the addition of several new facilities in the U.S.\nFood Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Food Ingredients segment totaled 1.08 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Food Ingredients segment decreased approximately (3.4)%. The decline was primarily due to certain food grade raw materials being diverted directly to the Chinese food markets as a result of ASF.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Food Ingredients segment primarily due to lower food grade bone and fat raw material volumes and therefore lower sales volumes, lower casings sales prices and strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018. These factors were somewhat offset by higher hydrolyzed collagen sales volumes and values.\nMargins. In the Food Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 22.7% as compared to 19.4% for fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily due to improved margins from the growth of the collagen business and the closure of the Argentina collagen plant which more than offset lower casing and edible fat margins.\nSegment operating income. Food Ingredients' operating income was $90.6 million for fiscal year 2019, an increase of $56.8 million or 168.0% as compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily due to improved results in the collagen markets, a gain on sale of assets in China and no restructuring and impairment charges in the current year as compared to fiscal year 2018 when the Company closed its Argentina collagen plant.\nFuel Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2019, the raw material processed by the Company's Fuel Ingredients segment totaled 1.26 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2018, overall raw material volume processed in the Fuel Ingredients segment increased approximately 7.2%.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Fuel Ingredients segment primarily due the European business sales that translated to less U.S. dollar sales as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar as well as lower diesel and RIN values in North America.\nMargins. In the Fuel Ingredients segment (exclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2019, the gross margin percentage was 25.3% as compared to 22.2% for fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily related to the fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, as compared to 2017 blenders tax credits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nSegment operating income.The Company's Fuel Ingredients segment operating income (inclusive of the equity contribution from DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2019 was $398.8 million, an increase of $203.7 million or 104.4% as compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to 2017 reinstated blenders tax credits booked in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nForeign Currency\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Euro and Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal year 2018. Using actual results for fiscal year 2019 and the prior year's average foreign currency rates for fiscal year 2018 would result in an increase in operating income of approximately $16.9 million. The average rates assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for fiscal year 2019 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.12 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.75 as compared to the average rate for fiscal year 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nCorporate Activities\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $57.9 million during fiscal year 2019, a $12.1 million increase from $45.8 million during fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate related compensation benefits and other corporate expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $0.5 million to $10.4 million during fiscal year 2019 as compared to $10.9 million during fiscal year 2018. The decrease was due to certain of the Company's corporate assets becoming fully depreciated as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $78.7 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $86.4 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $7.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to an interest rate decrease on the Company's euro and U.S. based senior notes, a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization and a reduction in term loan A and term loan B interest due to lower interest rates and lower debt outstanding as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nDebt Extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs were $12.1 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $23.5 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease was due to lower tender and redemption premiums and write-off of deferred loan costs on the 5.375% Senior Notes as compared to the 4.75% Senior Notes extinguished in fiscal year 2018.\nForeign Currency Losses. Foreign currency losses were $1.3 million during fiscal year 2019, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.4 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease is due primarily to lower losses on the revaluation of non-functional currency liabilities as compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.\nGain (loss) on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries represents a gain incurred in fiscal year 2019 on the sale of the Company's trap business in Canada and a gain on the sale of a foreign consolidated joint venture in Europe. The loss on sale of subsidiaries in fiscal year 2018 represents the loss recorded on the sale of a domestic subsidiary that more than offset a gain recorded on the liquidation of a majority owned foreign joint venture.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense was $6.7 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $7.6 million in fiscal year 2018. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to an increase in insurance proceeds on fire and casualty losses that more than offset an increase in the non-service cost component of pension expense and a reduction of interest income.\nEquity in Net Income in Investment of Other Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This primarily represents the Company's pro rata share of the net income from its foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries other than the DGD Joint Venture that more than offset net losses from a domestic unconsolidated subsidiary.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded income tax expense of $59.5 million for fiscal year 2019, compared to $12.0 million of income tax expense recorded in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $47.5 million, which was primarily due to an increase in income from operations before income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 was 15.6% and 10.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2018 and 2019 during 2019 and the relative mix of earnings among jurisdictions with different tax rates. Excluding the impact of the 2018 and 2019 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 27.4%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 during 2018, tax law changes in the Netherlands, and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to deferred tax assets for tax losses that are not expected to be utilized in future years. Excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 34.4%.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance. Since EBITDA (generally, net income plus interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is not calculated identically by all companies, the presentation in this report may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA presentations disclosed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated below and represents, for any relevant period, net income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, (income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, income tax provision, other income/(expense) and equity in net (income)/loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and certain non-cash and other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nAs a result, the Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure to evaluate performance and for other discretionary purposes. In addition to the foregoing, management also uses or will use Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain financial covenants under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes that were outstanding at December 28, 2019. However, the amounts shown below for Adjusted EBITDA differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes, as those definitions permit further adjustments to reflect certain other non-recurring costs, non-cash charges and cash dividends from the DGD Joint Venture. Additionally, the Company evaluates the impact of foreign currency exchange on operating cash flow, which is defined as segment operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization.\nReconciliation of Net Income to (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA and (Non-GAAP) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal Year 2019 As Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\n\n(1) The average rate assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.12 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.75 as compared to the average rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) of $436.9 million, as compared to $431.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2018. The increase is attributable to higher margin collagen in the Feed Ingredients segment.\nOn a Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP) basis, the Company would have generated $453.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $431.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nDGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share) is not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA, the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, or the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP). See Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for financial information regarding the DGD Joint Venture.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2017\nOperating Performance Metrics\nOperating performance metrics indicators which management routinely monitors as an indicator of operating performance include:\n \u2022 Finished product commodity prices \n \u2022 Segment results \n \u2022 Foreign currency exchange \n \u2022 Corporate activities \n \u2022 Non-U.S. GAAP measures \nThese indicators and their importance are discussed below.\nFinished Product Commodity Prices\nAverage Jacobsen and Reuters prices (at the specified delivery point) for fiscal year 2018, compared to average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for fiscal year 2017 are:\n\nThe following table shows the average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the average Jacobsen and Reuters prices for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.\n\nSegment Results\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 was $255.0 million, which reflects an increase of $85.6 million or 50.5% as compared to the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.\n\n\nFeed Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Feed Ingredients segment totaled 8.60 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Feed Ingredients segment increased approximately 4.4%.\nSales. During the year ended December 29, 2018, net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment were $1,952.6 million as compared to $2,239.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2017, a decrease of approximately $286.9 million. Net sales for fats were approximately $564.7 million and $648.3 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Protein net sales were approximately $842.9 million and $816.1 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Other rendering net sales, which include hides, pet food, and service charges, were approximately $129.3 million and $286.2 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Total rendering net sales were approximately $1,536.9 million and $1,750.6 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Used cooking oil net sales were approximately $166.7 million and $185.5 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. Bakery net sales were approximately $180.2 million and $209.8 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 and other sales, which includes trap services, and for 2017 industrial residual services, were approximately $68.8 million and $93.6 million for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\nThe decrease in net sales for the Feed Ingredients segment was primarily due to the following (in millions of dollars):\n\n (1) The decrease in freight revenue represents the impact from adoption of the new revenue standard on current year Feed Segment revenue as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2017. See Note 22 to the Notes for impact on consolidated financial statements. \n(2) The decrease in other rendering net sales was primarily due to the Company's sale of a portion of its interest in a majority owned consolidated subsidiary operating in cattle hides as part of its European operations, which resulted in the foreign subsidiary being deconsolidated and accounted for using the equity method of accounting, effective January 2018. In addition, the decrease in other net sales is due to the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business in May 2018.\nMargins. In the Feed Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 23.3% as compared to 22.1% for fiscal year 2017. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the new revenue standard whereby the Company no longer includes billed freight in revenue, as it did in fiscal year 2017.\nSegment operating income. Feed Ingredients' operating income for fiscal year 2018 was $82.8 million, a decrease of $49.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2017. Segment operating income was down in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to lower finished fat product prices and higher depreciation charges from increased capital expenditures that more than offset increased raw material volumes.\nFood Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Food Ingredients segment totaled 1.11 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Food Ingredients segment decreased approximately (0.2)%.\nSales. Overall sales decreased in the Food Ingredients segment as a result of the permanent shut down of the Company's Hurlingham, Argentina collagen plant, a more competitive European collagen market and lower edible fat sales prices.\nMargins. In the Food Ingredients segment for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 19.4% as compared to 20.5% for fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower margins from European collagen due to lower sales volumes and pressure on margins from export sales, combined with an increase in raw material prices for casings and a decrease in edible fat sales prices.\nSegment operating income. Food Ingredients' operating income was $33.8 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $23.1 million or (40.6)% as compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the restructuring and impairment charges incurred as a result of the Hurlingham, Argentina collagen plant shut down and lower earnings in the European collagen market. The casings business delivered slightly lower earnings in fiscal year 2018 due to an increase of raw material prices as compared to fiscal year 2017. The Company's edible fat prices were lower in fiscal year 2018 as a result of competing fat markets as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nFuel Ingredients Segment\nRaw material volume. In fiscal year 2018, the raw material processed by the Company's Fuel Ingredients segment totaled 1.18 million metric tons. Compared to fiscal year 2017, overall raw material volume processed in the Fuel Ingredients segment decreased approximately (0.6)%.\nSales. Overall sales increased in the Fuel Ingredients segment primarily due to higher sales volumes at Ecoson and in North America due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 of approximately $12.6 million as compared to no blenders tax credits in the same period in fiscal year 2017.\nMargins. In the Fuel Ingredients segment (exclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2018, the gross margin percentage was 22.2% as compared to 20.8% for fiscal year 2017. This increase was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits in North America recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nSegment operating income. The Company's Fuel Ingredients segment income (inclusive of the equity contribution from the DGD Joint Venture) for fiscal year 2018 was $195.1 million, an increase of $152.9 million or 362.3% as compared to fiscal year 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reinstated fiscal year 2017 blenders tax credits in North America recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the lack of blenders tax credits in the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nForeign Currency\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the U.S. dollar weakened against most of the other functional currencies used by the Company's non-domestic operations when compared to fiscal year 2017. Using actual results for fiscal year 2018 and the prior year's average foreign currency rates for fiscal year 2017 would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $8.6 million. The average rates assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for fiscal year 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77 as compared to the average rate for fiscal year 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.13 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nCorporate Activities\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $45.8 million during fiscal year 2018, a $4.4 million decrease from $50.2 million during fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in corporate related compensation benefits and other corporate expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $1.0 million to $10.9 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to $11.9 million during fiscal year 2017. The decrease was due to certain of the Company's corporate assets becoming fully depreciated as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $86.4 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $88.9 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $2.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to an interest rate decrease on the Company's euro based senior notes, a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization and a reduction in other debt interest that more than offset an increase in revolver interest from higher fiscal year 2018 revolver borrowings as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nDebt Extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs were $23.5 million during fiscal year 2018, compared to none for fiscal year 2017. The costs in 2018 were due to tender and redemption premiums and the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the retirement of the 4.75% Senior Notes.\nForeign Currency Losses. Foreign currency losses were $6.4 million during fiscal year 2018, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.9 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease in foreign currency losses was primarily due to reduction in losses on non-designated foreign exchange hedge contracts as compared to fiscal year 2017.\nLoss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Loss on disposal of subsidiaries represents a loss recorded from the sale of the Company's industrial residuals business during fiscal year 2018, that more than offset a gain recorded on the liquidation of a majority owned foreign joint venture in fiscal year 2018, as compared to a loss booked in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the sale of a portion of a majority owned foreign subsidiary.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense was $7.6 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $8.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in other expense for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in non-service cost component of pension expense that more than offset an increase in casualty losses in fiscal year 2018 and a reduction of interest income.\nEquity in Net Income/(loss) of Other Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This primarily represents the Company's pro rata share for fiscal year 2018 net losses of its domestic unconsolidated subsidiary other than the DGD Joint Venture that more than offset net income from foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries as compared to fiscal year 2017, which included net income of foreign unconsolidated subsidiaries that more than offset net losses of the Company's domestic unconsolidated subsidiary.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded income tax expense of $12.0 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $69.2 million of income tax benefit recorded in fiscal year 2017, an increase of $81.2 million, which was primarily due to tax law changes enacted in December 2017 with respect to several of the Company's major tax jurisdictions. Specifically, in fiscal year 2017 a tax benefit of $75.0 million was recorded due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d or U.S. tax reform\u201d) in the United States, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and a tax benefit of $13.9 million was recorded for tax law changes in Belgium and France ( European tax law changes\u201d). The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 was 10.2% and (107.7)%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 during 2018, tax law changes in the Netherlands, and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to deferred tax assets for tax losses that are not expected to be utilized in future years. The biofuel tax incentive expired as of the end of fiscal year 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 34.4%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 differs from the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax reform, European tax law changes, the relative mix of earnings among jurisdictions\nwith different tax rates, and subpart F income. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and European tax law changes, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 is 30.8%.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nFor a discussion of the reasons the Company's management believes the following Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and the purposes for which the Company's management uses such measures, see Results of Operations - Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 - Non-U.S. GAAP Measures.\u201d\nReconciliation of Net Income to (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA and (Non-GAAP) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal Year 2018 As Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\n\n(1) The average rate assumption used in this calculation was the actual fiscal average rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.18 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77 as compared to the average rate for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.13 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.77, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) of $431.4 million, as compared to $443.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. The decrease is attributable to lower earnings in the Feed Ingredients and Food Ingredients segment.\nOn a Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP) basis, the Company would have generated $422.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, as compared to $443.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017.\nDGD Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (Darling's Share) is not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA, the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, or the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency (Non-GAAP). See Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for financial information regarding the DGD Joint Venture.\nFINANCING, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIndebtedness\nCertain Debt Outstanding at December 28, 2019. On December 28, 2019, debt outstanding under the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, the Company's 5.25% Notes and the Company's 3.625% Notes consists of the following (in thousands):\n\nAt December 28, 2019, the U.S. dollar was stronger as compared to the euro and weaker as compared to the Canadian dollar at December 29, 2018. Using the euro and Canadian dollar based debt outstanding at December 29, 2018 and comparing the closing balance sheet rates at December 28, 2019 to those at December 29, 2018, the U.S. dollar debt balances of euro based debt decreased by $16.2 million and the U.S. dollar debt balances of Canadian based debt increased by approximately $0.2 million, at December 28, 2019. The closing balance sheet rate assumptions used in this calculation were the actual fiscal closing balance sheet rate at December 29, 2018 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.114750 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.763789 as compared to the closing balance sheet rate at December 30, 2017 of \u20ac1.00:USD$1.146600 and CAD$1.00:USD$0.735401, respectively.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities. On January 6, 2014, Darling, Darling International Canada Inc. ( Darling Canada\u201d) and Darling International NL Holdings B.V. ( Darling NL\u201d) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), restating its then existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 27, 2013, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other agents from time to time party thereto. Effective December 18, 2017, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) with its lenders to the Amended Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fifth Amendment (i) refinanced the term B loans under the Amended Credit Agreement with new term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million with a maturity date of December 18, 2024; (ii) adjusted the applicable margin pricing on borrowings under the term B loan; (iii) modified certain of the negative covenants to increase the allowances for certain actions, including debt and investments; and (iv) made other updates and changes. Effective December 16, 2016, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) with its lenders to the Amended Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fourth Amendment extended the maturity date of the term A loans and revolving credit facility loans under the Amended Credit Agreement from September 27, 2018 to December 16, 2021. For more information regarding the Amended Credit Agreement see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\n \u2022 As of December 28, 2019, the Company had availability of $911.9 million under the revolving loan facility, taking into account an aggregate of $39.0 million in outstanding borrowings, $45.5 million of ancillary facilities and letters of credit issued of $3.6 million. \n \u2022 As of December 28, 2019, the Company has borrowed all $350.0 million under the term loan A facility and has repaid all $350.0 million, which when repaid, cannot be reborrowed. \n \u2022 As of December 28, 2019, the Company has borrowed all $525.0 million under the terms of the term loan B facility and repaid approximately $30.0 million, which when repaid, cannot be reborrowed. The term loan B facility is repayable in quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant term loan B facility on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year commencing on the last day of each month falling on or after the last day of the first full quarter following December 18, 2017, and continuing until the last day of each quarter period ending immediately prior to December 18, 2024; and one final installment in the amount of the relevant term loan B facility then outstanding, due on December 18, 2024. The term loan B facility will mature on December 18, 2024. \n \u2022 The interest rate applicable to any borrowings under the term loan B facility will equal the base rate plus 1.00% or LIBOR plus 2.00%. \n5.25% Senior Notes due 2027. On April 3, 2019, Darling issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 5.25% Notes\u201d). The 5.25% Notes, which were offered in a private offering, were issued pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of April 3, 2019 (the 5.25% Indenture\u201d), among Darling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, and Regions Bank, as trustee. The gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance all of the Company's formerly outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 5.375% Notes\u201d), by cash tender offer for and redemption of all of the Company's then-outstanding 5.375% Notes, to pay the discount of the initial purchasers and to pay other fees and expenses related to the offering of the 5.25% Notes. The refinancing of the 5.375% Notes was completed in the second quarter of 2019. For a description of the terms of the 5.25% Notes see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n3.625 % Senior Notes due 2026. On May 2, 2018, Darling Global Finance B.V. issued and sold \u20ac515 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 3.625% Notes\u201d). The 3.625% Notes, which were offered in a private offering, were issued pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of May 2, 2018, among Darling Global Finance B.V., Darling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee and principal paying agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Deutschland AG, as principal registrar. The gross proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, were used to refinance all of the then Company's formerly outstanding 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 4.75% Notes\u201d) by cash tender offer and redemption of those notes and to pay any applicable premiums for the refinancing, to pay the commission of the initial purchasers of the 3.625% Notes and to pay the other fees and expenses related to the offering. The refinancing of the 4.75% Notes was completed in the second quarter of 2018. For a description of the terms of the 3.625% Notes see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther debt consists of U.S., Canadian and European ancillary and overdraft facilities and capital lease obligations and note arrangements in Brazil, China and Europe that are not part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, 5.25% Notes or 3.625% Notes.\nThe classification of long-term debt in the Company's December 28, 2019 consolidated balance sheet is based on the contractual repayment terms of the 5.25% Notes, the 3.625% Notes and debt issued under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of the Company's borrowings under its Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture, the Company is highly leveraged. Investors should note that, in order to make scheduled payments on the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, and otherwise, the Company will rely in part on a combination of dividends, distributions and intercompany loan repayments from the Company's direct and indirect U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The Company is prohibited under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture from entering (or allowing such subsidiaries to enter) into contractual limitations on the Company's subsidiaries' ability to declare dividends or make other payments or distributions to the Company. The Company has also attempted to structure the Company's consolidated indebtedness in such a way as to maximize the Company's ability to move cash from the Company's subsidiaries to Darling or another subsidiary that will have fewer limitations on the ability to make upstream payments, whether to Darling or directly to the Company's lenders as a Guarantor. Nevertheless, applicable laws under which the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries are formed may provide limitations on such dividends, distributions and other payments. In addition, regulatory authorities in various countries where the Company operates or where the Company imports or exports products may from time to time impose import/export limitations, foreign exchange controls or currency devaluations that may limit the Company's access to profits from the Company's subsidiaries or otherwise negatively impact the Company's financial condition and therefore reduce the Company's ability to make required payments under Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, or otherwise. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange values may have a negative impact on the Company's ability to repay indebtedness denominated in U.S. or Canadian dollars or euros. See Risk Factors - Our business may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, which could affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants\u201d and - Our ability to repay our indebtedness depends in part on the performance of our subsidiaries, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and their ability to make payments\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.\nAs of December 28, 2019, the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, as well as all of the other covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Indenture and the 3.625% Indenture.\nWorking Capital and Capital Expenditures\nOn December 28, 2019, the Company had working capital of $228.9 million and its working capital ratio was 1.33 to 1 compared to working capital of $357.4 million and a working capital ratio of 1.66 to 1 on December 29, 2018. At December 28, 2019, the Company had unrestricted cash of $72.9 million and funds available under the revolving credit facility of $911.9 million, compared to unrestricted cash of $107.3 million and funds available under the revolving credit facility of $929.8 million at December 29, 2018. The Company diversifies its cash investments by limiting the amounts deposited with any one financial institution and invests primarily in government-backed securities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $362.6 million and $398.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, a decrease of $36.0 million due primarily to an increase in net income that was mostly offset by equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture and to changes in operating assets and liabilities that include a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of approximately $19.8 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and inventory of $41.5 million, a decrease in other of approximately $8.8 million, an increase in income taxes refundable/payable of approximately $19.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expense of approximately $17.9 million. Cash used by investing activities was $338.1 million during fiscal year 2019, compared to $342.4 million in fiscal year 2018, a decrease in cash used of $4.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets that was more than offset by an increase in cash received from insurance. Net cash used by financing activities was $54.9 million during fiscal year 2019, compared to $47.6 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase in cash used of $7.3 million, primarily due to purchases of common stock that more than offset a decrease in debt payments as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nCapital expenditures of $359.5 million were made during fiscal year 2019 as compared to $321.9 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $37.6 million, or 11.7%. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures for expansion in fiscal 2019. In fiscal year 2020, the Company expects to incur approximately $236.0 million in maintenance and compliance type capital expenditures and approximately $70.0 million for new construction (including expansions) for a total of approximately $306.0 million. These costs are expected to be financed using cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations were $37.4 million in fiscal year 2019, $32.1 million in fiscal year 2018 and $27.5 million in fiscal year 2017.\nAccrued Insurance and Pension Plan Obligations\nBased upon the annual actuarial estimate, current accruals and claims paid during fiscal year 2019, the Company has accrued approximately $9.7 million as of December 28, 2019 that it expects will become due during the next twelve months in order to meet obligations related to the Company's self insurance reserves and accrued insurance obligations, which are included in current accrued expenses at December 28, 2019. The self insurance reserve is composed of estimated liability for claims arising for workers' compensation and for auto liability and general liability claims. The self insurance reserve liability is determined annually, based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The actuarial estimate may vary from year to year, due to changes in costs of health care, the pending number of claims and other factors beyond the control of management of the Company.\nBased upon current actuarial estimates, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $0.9 million in order to meet minimum pension funding requirements to its domestic plans in fiscal year 2020. In addition, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $3.4 million under its foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2020. The minimum pension funding requirements are determined annually, based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The actuarial estimate may vary from year to year, due to fluctuations in return on investments or other factors beyond the control of management of the Company or the administrator of the Company's pension funds. No assurance can be given that the minimum pension funding requirements will not increase in the future. The Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its domestic pension plans in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 of approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2019 of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to $3.5 million in contributions in fiscal year 2018.\nThe U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( PPA\u201d) went into effect in January 2008. The stated goal of the PPA is to improve the funding of U.S. pension plans. U.S. plans in an under-funded status are required to increase employer contributions to improve the funding level within PPA timelines. Volatility in the world equity and other financial markets could have a material negative impact on U.S. pension plan assets and the status of required funding under the PPA. The Company participates in various U.S. multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. The Company's contributions to each individual U.S. multiemployer plan represent less than 5% of the total contributions to each such plan. Based on the most currently available information, the Company has determined that, if a withdrawal were to occur, withdrawal liabilities on two of the U.S. plans in which the Company\ncurrently participates could be material to the Company, with one of these material plans certified as critical or red zone. With respect to the other U.S. multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates and which are not individually significant, five plans have certified as critical or red zone and two have certified as endangered or yellow zone, as defined by the PPA. The Company has received notices of withdrawal liability from five U.S. multiemployer pension plans in which it participated. As a result, the Company has an accrued aggregate current liability of approximately $6.0 million representing the present value of scheduled withdrawal liability payments under these multiemployer plans. While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multiemployer plans that could terminate or could require additional funding under the PPA, the amounts could be material.\nDGD Joint Venture\nThe Company announced on January 21, 2011 that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darling entered into a limited liability company agreement with Valero to form the DGD Joint Venture. The DGD Joint Venture is owned 50% / 50% with Valero and was formed to design, engineer, construct and operate the DGD Facility, which as a result of its recently expanded capacity is now capable of processing approximately 20,000 barrels per day of input feedstock to produce renewable diesel fuel and certain other co-products, and is located adjacent to Valero's refinery in Norco, Louisiana. The DGD Joint Venture reached mechanical completion and began the production of renewable diesel in late June 2013. Effective May 1, 2019, the DGD LLC Agreement was amended and restated for the purpose of updating the agreement in certain respects, including to remove certain provisions that were no longer relevant and to add new provisions relating to the DGD Joint Venture's recently approved expansion project to construct a new, parallel facility located next to the current facility, as further described below.\nOn May 1, 2019, Darling, through its wholly owned subsidiary Darling Green Energy LLC, ( Darling Green\u201d), and Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero ( Diamond Alternative\u201d and together with Darling Green, the DGD Lenders\u201d) entered into a revolving loan agreement (the DGD Loan Agreement\u201d) with the DGD Joint Venture. The DGD Lenders have committed to make loans available to the DGD Joint Venture in the total amount of $50.0 million with each lender committed to $25.0 million of the total commitment. Any borrowings by the DGD Joint Venture under the DGD Loan Agreement are at the applicable annum rate equal to the sum of (a) the LIBO Rate (meaning Reuters BBA Libor Rates Page 3750) on such day plus (b) 2.50%. The DGD Loan Agreement matures on April 29, 2020, unless extended by agreement of the parties. The DGD Loan Agreement replaces a similar agreement with lower commitment levels that expired on December 31, 2018. As of December 28, 2019, no amounts are owed to the DGD Lenders under the DGD Loan Agreement.\nBased on the sponsor support agreements executed in connection with the initial construction of the DGD Facility, the Company contributed a total of approximately $111.7 million for completion of the DGD Facility including the Company's portion of cost overruns and working capital funding. As of December 28, 2019, under the equity method of accounting the Company has an investment in the DGD Joint Venture of approximately $661.5 million included on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn August 2018, the DGD Joint Venture completed an expansion project that increased the DGD Facility's annual production capacity from 160 million gallons of renewable diesel to 275 million gallons and expanded outbound logistics for servicing the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. In November 2018, the joint venture partners approved the DGD Joint Venture moving forward with another expansion project to construct a new, parallel facility (the New Facility\u201d) located next to the current facility. The New Facility is expected to grow the DGD Joint Venture's annual production capacity by an additional 400 million gallons from the current capacity of 275 million gallons of renewable diesel to 675 million gallons of renewable diesel and provide the capability to separate naphtha for sale into low carbon fuel markets. In addition, the expansion project includes further expanded inbound and outbound logistics for servicing the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. The DGD Joint Venture estimates completion and startup of the New Facility in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the total cost of the expansion project, including the naphtha production and improved logistics capability, is estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Based on forecasted margins as of the date of this report, the expansion project is expected to be substantially funded by DGD Joint Venture cash flow; however, the DGD LLC Agreement provides that until such time as the New Facility is complete and operational, the joint venture partners shall be required to make capital contributions or, if they agree, loans, to the DGD Joint Venture should the excess available cash in the DGD Joint Venture, as determined on specified dates and in accordance with the provisions contained in the DGD LLC Agreement, fall below $50 million.\nIn April 2019, the joint venture partners adopted a distribution policy that, unless earlier terminated by the partners, will remain in place through the construction and completion of the New Facility. Pursuant to the distribution policy, the DGD Joint Venture will make quarterly distributions to the partners to the extent that distributable cash (as determined in accordance with the policy) exceeds $50 million and as allowed by the DGD Joint Venture's forward looking cash forecast. During the year ended December 28, 2019, the DGD Joint Venture made approximately $67.5 million distributions to each of the partners.\nThe Company's original investment in DGD has expanded since 2011 to the point that it is now integral to how Darling operates its business. Darling traditionally collected and converted used cooking oil and animal fats into feed ingredients which were sold on a caloric value to feed animals as well as for industrial technical uses. Over the past decade, the world's increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas has provided a new finished market for the Company's finished fats ingredients. With Darling's significant fats ownership, this has and continues to transform how Darling operates. In 2018, a large portion of Darling's total U.S. finished fats products were sold to the DGD Facility as feedstock for renewable diesel. This percentage is expected to noticeably increase both in 2019 and beyond due to the recent DGD capacity expansion completed in August 2018 and the even larger expansion to be finished in late 2021. In 2019 and 2018, DGD was Darling's largest finished product customer in terms of sales, with Darling recording sales of $208.7 million and $131.8 million to DGD, respectively.\nFrom a procurement, production and distribution standpoint, DGD has become integral to Darling's base business. DGD is integral to the Company's operations via the combined vertical operating structure from collecting raw fats, to processing collected fats at Darling facilities nationwide to transporting the refined fats to the DGD facility as feedstock. The Darling supply chain has become more efficient and sustainable with transparency for verification to obtain full value to low carbon intensity markets. The development of the low carbon markets in North America and Europe has influenced how Darling operates its core business and has also been a driver for the recent DGD expansions, which are making DGD much more relevant to Darling's earnings. Since 2011 when construction began on DGD, Darling has invested substantially to increase its U.S. railcar fleet to efficiently manage nationwide transportation of Darling fats to DGD. Additionally, Darling acquired an Iowa location on the Mississippi River that further enhances the ability of the Company's Midwest network of facilities to collect and deliver feedstocks to DGD via water, rail or truck from a centralized location. Darling has also stepped up collection efforts by providing indoor used cooking oil collection units in exchange for extended collection contracts at eating establishments and has moved to more of a centralized digital marketing effort with restaurant chains and franchise groups and invested in internet search engine key words to improve visibility with restaurants. The Company also includes DGD in marketing efforts to emphasize environmental sustainability that restaurants participate in when their used cooking oil is collected by Darling. From a production standpoint, Darling now isolates used cooking oil from other fats to preserve identification to qualify for a higher carbon intensity value. As a result, the Company has reclassified its equity in net income of the DGD Joint Venture to operating income for all periods presented.\nIn September 2019, the Company announced that the DGD Joint Venture was initiating an advanced engineering and development cost review for construction of a new renewable diesel plant to be located in Port Arthur, Texas. The proposed facility under review would be designed to produce 400 million gallons of renewable diesel annually as well as 40 million gallons of renewable naphtha. The final investment decision on the project is expected in 2021, subject to further engineering, obtaining necessary permits, and approval by the boards of the Company and Valero. If the decision is made to move forward, new plant construction could begin in 2021, with expected operations commencing in 2024.\nFinancial Impact of Significant Debt Outstanding\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our financial lenders and our contractual and commercial commitments, limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows from operations available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and business conditions, expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors, and/or increase our cost of borrowing.\nCash Flows and Liquidity Risks\nManagement believes that the Company's cash flows from operating activities consistent with the level generated in fiscal year 2019, unrestricted cash and funds available under the Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet the Company's working capital needs and maintenance and compliance-related capital expenditures, scheduled debt and interest payments, income tax obligations, and other contemplated needs through the next twelve months. Numerous factors could have adverse consequences to the Company that cannot be estimated at this time, such as those factors discussed below under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could negatively impact the Company's results of operations in fiscal year 2020 and thereafter. The Company reviews the appropriate use of unrestricted cash periodically. As of the date of this\nreport, no decision has been made as to non-ordinary course material cash usages at this time; however, potential usages could include: opportunistic capital expenditures and/or acquisitions and joint ventures; investments relating to the Company's renewable energy strategy, including, without limitation, potential required funding obligations with respect to the DGD Joint Venture expansion project or potential investments in additional renewable diesel and/or biodiesel projects; investments in response to governmental regulations relating to human and animal food safety or other regulations; unexpected funding required by the legislation, regulation or mass termination of multiemployer plans; and paying dividends or repurchasing stock, subject to limitations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 5.25% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, as well as suitable cash conservation to withstand adverse commodity cycles. In August 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock depending on market conditions. On August 7, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the extension for an additional two years of its previously announced share repurchase program and refreshed the amount of the program back up to its original amount of an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock depending on market conditions. To that point, the Company had previously repurchased $10.9 million shares of its Common stock under the program. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. On November 6, 2018, the Board approved an increase in the share repurchase program from $100.0 million to $200.0 million and extended the term of the program for an additional year to August 13, 2020. Repurchases may occur through August 13, 2020, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors. Since the inception of the share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased approximately $30.1 million of its common stock in open market purchases and, as of the date of this report, has $180.8 million remaining in its share repurchase program.\nEach of the factors described above has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity in a variety of ways, including through reduced raw materials availability, reduced finished product prices, reduced sales, potential inventory buildup, increased bad debt reserves, potential impairment charges and/or higher operating costs.\nSales prices for the principal products that the Company sells are typically influenced by sales prices for agricultural-based ingredients, the prices of which are based on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes. Any decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity. Any of a decline in raw material availability, a decline in agricultural-based alternative ingredients prices, increases in energy prices or the impact of U.S. and foreign regulation (including, without limitation, China), changes in foreign exchange rates, imposition of currency controls and currency devaluations has the potential to adversely impact the Company's liquidity. A decline in commodities prices, a rise in energy prices, a slowdown in the U.S. or international economy or other factors, could cause the Company to fail to meet management's expectations or could cause liquidity concerns.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the Company's expected material contractual payment obligations, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements at December 28, 2019 (in thousands):\n\n (a) The above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions at December 28, 2019. The Company's uncertain tax position is approximately $7.8 million. \n (b) Represents debt obligations outstanding as of December 28, 2019. See Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (c) See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (d) Interest payable was calculated using the current rate for the debt that was outstanding as of December 28, 2019. \n (e) Purchase commitments were determined based on specified contracts for natural gas, diesel fuel and finished product purchases. \n (f) Pension funding requirements are determined annually based upon a third party actuarial estimate. The Company expects to make approximately $4.8 million in required contributions to domestic and foreign pension plans in fiscal year 2020. The Company is not able to estimate pension funding requirements beyond the next twelve months. The accrued pension benefit liability was approximately $56.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2019. The Company knows certain of the multiemployer pension plans that have not terminated to which it contributes and which are not administered by the Company were under-funded as of the latest available information, and while the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for the under-funded multiemployer plan to which the Company contributes, the amounts could be material. \nThe Company's off-balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 28, 2019 relate to letters of credit, foreign bank guarantees, forward purchase agreements and employment agreements. The Company has excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's other commercial commitments, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements that are part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement and other foreign bank guarantees that are not a part of the Company's Amended Credit Agreement at December 28, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nOFF BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS\nBased upon the underlying purchase agreements, the Company has commitments to purchase $95.7 million of commodity products, consisting of approximately $52.2 million of finished and raw material products and approximately $43.5 million of natural gas and diesel fuel commitments during the next two years, which are not included in liabilities on the Company's balance sheet at December 28, 2019. These purchase agreements are entered into in the normal course of the Company's business and are not subject to derivative accounting. The commitments will be recorded on the balance sheet of the Company when delivery of these commodities occurs and ownership passes to the Company during the next two years, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions that may deviate from actual results. In particular, management makes estimates regarding fair value of the Company's reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment of both long-lived assets and goodwill and pension liability. Each of these estimates is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. In fiscal year 2018, the Company shut down the operations at its Hurlingham, Argentina plant and recorded impairment charges related to its long-lived assets of approximately $2.4 million. In fiscal year 2019, no triggering event occurred requiring that the Company perform testing of its long-lived assets for impairment.\nGoodwill Valuation\nThe Company performed the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments at October 26, 2019 and concluded that the Company's goodwill for all reporting units and all recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired as of that date. Goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company follows a two-step process for testing impairment. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the unit's fair value of its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value.\nBased on the Company's annual impairment testing at October 26, 2019, October 27, 2018 and October 28, 2017, the fair values of the Company's reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying value. However, based on the Company's annual impairment testing at October 26, 2019, the fair value of four of the Company's eight reporting units was less than 30% in excess of its carrying value and one reporting unit (Canada Feed) was less than 10% in excess of the estimated fair value with goodwill of approximately $178.6 million, which was substantially less than the percentage by which the other reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values. The Company determined the fair value of reporting units with the assistance of a valuation expert who assisted the Company primarily using the Income Approach to determine the fair value of the Company's reporting units. Key assumptions that impacted the discounted cash flow model were raw material volumes, gross margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. It is possible, depending upon a number of factors that are not determinable at this time or within the control of the Company, that the fair value of these four reporting units could decrease in the future and result in an impairment to goodwill. The amount of goodwill allocated to these four reporting units was approximately $504.0 million. The Company's management believes the biggest risk to these reporting units is decreasing finished product prices impacting gross margins and an economic slowdown that would impact raw material suppliers. Goodwill was approximately $1,223.3 million and $1,229.2 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nPension Liability\nThe Company has retirement and pension plans covering a substantial number of its domestic and foreign employees. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels, mortality rates and trends in health care costs. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.\nThe discount rate applied to the Company's pension liability is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the pension benefit obligation. The weighted average discount rate was 2.77% at December 28, 2019 and 3.68% at December 29, 2018, respectively. The net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020 would increase by approximately $1.2 million if the discount rate was 0.5% lower at a weighted average of 2.27%. The net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020 would decrease by approximately $1.1 million if the discount rate was 0.5% higher at a weighted average of 3.27%.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU amends Topic 740 Income Taxes, which will eliminate certain exceptions in accounting for income taxes, improves consistency in application and clarifies existing guidance. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract. This ASU amends Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Internal - Use Software, which will align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. Implementation should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted the new accounting standard effective December 30, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. This ASU amends Subtopic 715-20, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The standard is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements. This ASU amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvement to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU amends Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies and simplify the application of hedge accounting. The guidance includes certain targeted improvements to ease the operational burden of applying hedge accounting. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company will be required to apply the guidance on a cumulative-effect basis with adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with disclosure on a prospective basis. The Company adopted this ASU on December 30, 2018 and the initial adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU amends Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which will simplify the goodwill impairment calculation by eliminating Step 2 from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under ASU 2016-13, existing guidance on reporting credit losses for trade and other receivables and available for sale debt securities will be replaced with a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein. The initial adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The Company adopted the new standard on December 30, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and is using the effective date as the Company's date of initial application and consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the this ASU will not be provided for dates and periods before December 30, 2018. The Company has elected the package of expedients, which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard the Company's prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to the Company.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking\u201d statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words such as estimate,\u201d project,\u201d planned,\u201d contemplate,\u201d potential,\u201d possible,\u201d proposed,\u201d intend,\u201d believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report are forward looking statements, including, without limitation, the statements under the sections entitled Business,\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Legal Proceedings\u201d and located elsewhere herein regarding industry prospects, the Company's financial position and the Company's use of cash. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. The Company cautions readers that any such forward-looking statements it makes are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including many that are beyond the Company's control.\nIn addition to those factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this report and elsewhere in this report, and in the Company's other public filings with the SEC, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations include: existing and unknown future limitations on the ability of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries to make their cash flow available to the Company for payments on the Company's indebtedness or other\npurposes; global demands for bio-fuels and grain and oilseed commodities, which have exhibited volatility, and can impact the cost of feed for cattle, hogs and poultry, thus affecting available rendering feedstock and selling prices for the Company's products; reductions in raw material volumes available to the Company due to weak margins in the meat production industry as a result of higher feed costs, reduced consumer demand or other factors, reduced volume from food service establishments, or otherwise; reduced demand for animal feed; reduced finished product prices, including a decline in fat and used cooking oil finished product prices; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and GHG emissions that adversely affect programs like the U.S. government's renewable fuel standard, low carbon fuel standards ( LCFS\u201d) and tax credits for biofuels both in the United States and abroad; possible product recall resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food or food additives; the occurrence of 2009 H1N1 flu (initially known as Swine Flu), highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as Bird Flu), SARS, BSE, PED or other diseases associated with animal origin in the United States or elsewhere, such as the outbreak of ASF in China and elsewhere; escalation in the outbreak of the coronavirus; unanticipated costs and/or reductions in raw material volumes related to the Company's compliance with the existing or unforeseen new U.S. or foreign (including, without limitation, China) regulations (including new or modified animal feed, Bird Flu, SARS, PED, BSE or ASF or similar or unanticipated regulations) affecting the industries in which the Company operates or its value added products; risks associated with the DGD Joint Venture, including possible unanticipated operating disruptions and issues relating to the announced expansion project; risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protections imposed by foreign countries; difficulties or a significant disruption in the Company's information systems or failure to implement new systems and software successfully, including the Company's ongoing enterprise resource planning project; risks relating to possible third party claims of intellectual property infringement; increased contributions to the Company's pension and benefit plans, including multiemployer and employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans as required by legislation, regulation or other applicable U.S. or foreign law or resulting from a U.S. mass withdrawal event; bad debt writeoffs; loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations; continued or escalated conflict in the Middle East, North Korea, Ukraine or elsewhere; uncertainty regarding the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; and/or unfavorable export or import markets. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, climate conditions, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements included in this report or negatively impact the Company's results of operations. Among other things, future profitability may be affected by the Company's ability to grow its business, which faces competition from companies that may have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company's announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and purchases of shares under the program are subject to market conditions and other factors, which are likely to change from time to time. The Company cautions readers that all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of changes in circumstances, new events or otherwise.", "item_7_tables": "Table 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Avg.

The Feed Ingredients segment saw a small increase in sales while Food Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients segments had decreases. \n\n- Net income attributable to Darling for 2019 was $312.6 million compared to $101.5 million in 2018, driven primarily by higher equity income from the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture.\n\n- Operating income was $475.8 million in 2019 versus $255.0 million in 2018. The increase was mainly due to higher earnings from the DGD joint venture.\n\n- The company expects 2020 capital expenditures of approximately $306 million, with $236 million for maintenance/compliance and $70 million for expansions. \n\n- At the end of 2019, the company had total debt outstanding of $1.6 billion, cash of $72.9 million, and $911.9 million available under its revolving credit facility.\n\n- Goodwill was $1.2 billion at the end of 2019. Impairment testing indicated no impairment, but the fair value of some reporting units was not substantially above carrying value, indicating heightened risk.\n\n- The company discusses factors that could negatively impact earnings, including commodity price volatility, foreign exchange fluctuations, changes in biofuel policies and regulations, and animal disease outbreaks."}
