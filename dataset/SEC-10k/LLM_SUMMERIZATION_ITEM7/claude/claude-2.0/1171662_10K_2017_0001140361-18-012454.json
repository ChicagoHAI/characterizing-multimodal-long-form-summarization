Overview\nWe are one of the most significant players in the managed care industry in Puerto Rico and have over 55 years of experience in this industry. We offer a broad portfolio of managed care and related products in the Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage markets. In the Commercial market we offer products to corporate accounts, U.S. federal government employees, local government employees, individual accounts and Medicare Supplement. We also participate in the Government of Puerto Rico Health Reform (a managed care program for the medically indigent funded by the Puerto Rico and U.S. federal governments that is similar to the Medicaid program in the U.S.) (Medicaid). The Island is divided in eight regions and we served all of them on an administrative service only basis (ASO) until March 31, 2015. Effective April 1, 2015, the government changed the Medicaid delivery model from an ASO to a risk-based model and we elected to participate as a fully-insured provider in only two regions of Puerto Rico.\nWe have the exclusive right to use the BCBS name and mark throughout Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. As of December 31, 2017 we serve approximately 978,000 members across all regions of Puerto Rico. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively, our managed care segment represented approximately 92% of our total consolidated premiums earned, net. We also participate in the life insurance and property and casualty insurance markets in Puerto Rico.\nWe participate in the managed care market through our subsidiaries, TSS, TSB and TSA. TSS, TSA and TSB are BCBSA licensees.\nWe participate in the life insurance market through our subsidiary, TSV, and in the property and casualty insurance market through our subsidiary, TSP.\nThe Commissioner of Insurance of the Government of Puerto Rico ( Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico\u201d) recognizes only statutory accounting practices for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, for determining its solvency under the Puerto Rico insurance laws, and for determining whether its financial condition warrants the payment of a dividend to its stockholders. No consideration is given by the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in making such determinations. See Note 24, Statutory Accounting, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2017 Consolidated Highlights\nKey developments in our business during 2017 are described below:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> Consolidated premiums earned, net decreased 2.2% year over year, to $2.8 billion, primarily reflecting lower Managed Care and Property and Casualty premiums.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> The lower Managed Care premiums reflect lower membership in the segment's Medicaid and Commercial businesses, the impact of the suspension of the HIP fee pass through in 2017, and lower Medicare additional risk score revenue.

These decreases were offset in part by the estimated $14.8 million net retained losses incurred by the Property and Casualty segment caused by the aforementioned Hurricanes. The consolidated loss ratio was down 230 basis points, to 83.2%, and the Medical Loss Ratio ( MLR\u201d) decreased 300 basis points, to 85.6%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> Consolidated operating expenses for the year were $477.2 million and the operating expense ratio was 16.8%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> Net income for the year was $54.5 million, an increase from a net income of $17.4 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in the Managed Care segment's MLR.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview details\nIntersegment revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis in each of the operating segments but eliminated in the consolidated results. Except as otherwise indicated, the numbers presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect intersegment eliminations. These intersegment revenues and expenses affect the amounts reported on the financial statement line items for each segment, but are eliminated in consolidation and do not change net income.

Our revenue consists primarily of (i) premium revenue generated from our managed care business, (ii) administrative service fees received for services provided to self-insured employers, (iii) premiums we generate from our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses and (iv) investment income.\nPremium Revenue. Our revenue primarily consists of premiums earned from the sale of managed care products to the Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid sectors. We receive a monthly payment from or on behalf of each member enrolled in our managed care plans (excluding ASO). We recognize all premium revenue in our managed care business during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to an enrolled member. Premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as unearned premiums.\nPremiums are set prospectively, meaning that a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of each contract year and revised at renewal. We renegotiate the premiums of different groups as their existing annual contracts become due. Our Medicare Advantage contracts entitle us to premium payments from CMS on behalf of each Medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans, generally on a per member per month ( PMPM\u201d) basis. We submit rate proposals to CMS in June for each Medicare Advantage product that will be offered beginning January 1 of the subsequent year in accordance with the competitive bidding process under the MMA. Retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to our Medicare Advantage plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan participants. Premium rates for the Medicaid business are based on a bid contract with ASES and are revised each year to be effective each July 1, at which time rates are fixed for the plan year.\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremiums on traditional life insurance policies are reported as earned when due. Premiums on accident and health and other short-term contracts are recognized as earned, primarily on a pro rata basis over the contract period. Premiums on credit life policies are recognized as earned in proportion to the amounts of insurance in force. Group insurance premiums are billed one month in advance and a grace period of one month is provided for premium payment. If the insured fails to pay within the one-month grace period, we may cancel the policy. We recognize premiums on property and casualty contracts as earned on a pro rata basis over the policy term. Property and casualty policies are subscribed through general agencies, which bill policy premiums to their clients in advance or, in the case of new business, at the inception date and remit collections to us, net of commissions. The portion of premiums related to the period prior to the end of coverage is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as unearned premiums and is transferred to premium revenue as earned.\nAdministrative Service Fees. Administrative service fees include amounts paid to us for administrative services provided to self-insured contracts. We provide a range of customer services pursuant to our administrative services only ( ASO\u201d) contracts, including claims administration, billing, access to our provider networks and membership services. Administrative service fees are recognized in the month in which services are provided.\nInvestment Income. Investment income consists of interest and dividend income from investment securities. See Note 4, Net Investment Income, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExpenses\nClaims Incurred. Our largest expense is medical claims incurred, or the cost of medical services we arrange for our members. Medical claims incurred include the payment of benefits and losses, mostly to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and other service providers, and to policyholders. We generally pay our providers on one of three forms: (1) fee-for-service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules; (2) capitation arrangements, generally on a fixed PMPM payment basis, whereby the provider generally assumes some of the medical expense risk; and (3) risk-sharing arrangements, whereby we advance a PMPM payment and share the risk of certain medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre-determined sharing ratios. Claims incurred also include claims incurred in our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses. Each segment's results of operations depend to a significant extent on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage claims and losses. A portion of the claims incurred for each period consists of claims reported but not paid during the period, as well as a management and actuarial estimate of claims incurred but not reported during the period.\nThe MLR, which is calculated by dividing managed care claims incurred by managed care premiums earned, net is one of our primary management tools for measuring these costs and their impact on our profitability. The MLR is affected by the cost and utilization of services. The cost of services is affected by many factors, in particular our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers. The cost of services is also influenced by inflation and new medical discoveries, including new prescription drugs, therapies and diagnostic procedures. Utilization rates, which reflect the extent to which beneficiaries utilize healthcare services, significantly influence our medical costs. The level of utilization of services depends in large part on the age, health and lifestyle of our members, among other factors. As the MLR is the ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned, net, it is affected not only by our ability to contain cost trends but also by our ability to increase premium rates to levels consistent with or above medical cost trends. We use MLRs both to monitor our management of healthcare costs and to make various business decisions, including what plans or benefits to offer and our selection of healthcare providers.\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses include commissions to external brokers, general and administrative expenses, cost containment expenses such as case and disease management programs, and depreciation and amortization. The operating expense ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses by premiums earned, net plus administrative service fees. A significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed costs. Accordingly, it is important that we maintain certain level of volume of business in order to compensate for the fixed costs. Significant changes in our volume of business will affect our operating expense ratio and results of operations. We also have variable costs, which vary in proportion to changes in volume of business.\nII. Membership\nOur results of operations depend in large part on our ability to maintain or grow our membership. In addition to driving revenues, membership growth is necessary to successfully introduce new products, maintain an extensive network of providers and achieve economies of scale. Our ability to maintain or grow our membership is affected principally by the competitive environment, the economy, and general market conditions.\nThe following table sets forth selected membership data as of the dates set forth below:\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 475,026\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 509,157\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 547,634\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,451\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 110,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 123,888\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 384,462\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 397,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 422,922\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 977,939\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,017,372\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,094,444\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Commercial membership includes corporate accounts, self-funded employers, individual accounts, Medicare Supplement, federal government employees and local government employees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIII.

This decrease primarily reflects lower premiums in the Managed Care segment by $58.5 million mainly due to lower membership in the segment's Medicaid and Commercial businesses, the impact of the suspension of the HIP fee pass through, and lower Medicare additional risk score revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher average premium rates in the Commercial and Medicaid businesses as well as by higher Medicare membership. Property and Casualty premiums decreased by $10.7 million year over year, mostly reflecting the $9.2 million estimated catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement costs following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.\nAdministrative service fees decreased $1.4 million, or 7.8%, mainly due to lower membership enrolled in this business.\nNet investment income increased $2.7 million, or 5.5%, to $51.6 million mostly as a result of higher invested balances.\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nClaims Incurred\nConsolidated claims incurred decreased by $119.1 million, or 4.8%, to $2.4 billion, mostly due to lower claims in the Managed Care segment offset by an increase in claims in the Property and Casualty segment. The decrease in Managed Care claims primarily reflects lower claims incurred across all businesses in the segment driven by the estimated decrease in utilization as a consequence of the aforementioned Hurricanes, lower enrollment in the Commercial and Medicaid enrollment, and favorable fluctuations in the prior period reserve developments in the Commercial and Medicare businesses. The Property and Casualty segment's estimated net retained losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria were approximately $14.8 million after the application of reinsurance. The consolidated loss ratio decreased by 230 basis points to 83.2%. Excluding the impact of prior-period reserve developments, and moving the Medicare risk score revenue and other revenue adjustments to the corresponding period, the Managed Care MLR for the year was 83.7%, 100 basis points lower than the same metric from the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased by $16.7 million, or 3.4%, to $477.2 million. The lower operating expenses are mostly the result of the decrease in the HIP Fee of $44.2 million due to the 2017 moratorium offset by increase in personnel costs, professional services, and business promotion expenses totaling approximately $30.4 million.\nIncome taxes\nConsolidated income taxes increased by $30.8 million, to a net expense of $24.5 million. The year over year change in income taxes primarily results from an increase in the taxable income from the Managed Care segment, which has a higher effective tax rate than our other segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net increased by $107.4 million, or 3.9%, to $2.9 billion. This increase primarily reflects higher premiums in the Managed Care segment by $99.0 million as a result of the change in the Medicaid service model effective April 1, 2015, from an ASO agreement to a fully insured model, and higher premium rates in the Commercial business. This increase was offset by lower member month enrollment in the Medicare and Commercial businesses and a decrease in the Medicare average premiums rates.\nAdministrative service fees decreased $26.8 million, or 60.0%, mostly as a result of the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract model. Total administrative fees related to the previous Medicaid ASO agreement during the 2015 period amounted to $24.3 million.\nNet investment income increased $3.7 million, or 8.2%, to $48.9 million mostly as a result of higher invested balances.\nClaims Incurred\nConsolidated claims incurred increased by $153.5 million, or 6.6%, to $2.5 billion, mostly due to higher claims in the Managed Care segment. This increase primarily reflects higher claims incurred in the segment's Medicaid business by $150.7 million after the contract changed to a fully insured model and the impact of Managed Care prior period reserve developments. The consolidated loss ratio increased by 220 basis points to 85.5%. Excluding the impact of prior period development, as well as moving the 2015 risk score revenue adjustments to its corresponding period, consolidated loss ratio was 84.1%, 70 basis points higher than last year.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased by $24.8 million, or 4.8%, to $493.9 million. The decrease reflects lower expenses following the change in the Medicaid membership after we elected to reduce the number of regions we serve, from eight regions under an ASO agreement to only two regions when the contract changed to a fully-insured model. The lower operating expenses also reflect a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, mostly due to the strengthening of the allowance for doubtful receivables in the 2015 period, lower payroll and related expenses resulting from accruals related to management changes and retirements impacting the 2015 period, as well as a $4.4 million expense related to settlement agreements entered with governmental agencies in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a new business-to-business tax implemented in Puerto Rico at the end of the third quarter 2015 and an increase in the Health Insurance Providers Fee, reflecting the at-risk Medicaid enrollment after the model changed in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the consolidated operating expense ratio decreased 130 basis points to 17.0%, as the result of the increase in premiums and lower expenses.\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nConsolidated income taxes resulted in a benefit of $6.3 million.

As a result, the segment's loss ratio increased by 1,940 basis points, to 65.8% during this period. Estimated gross losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria were $6.4 million and $687.0 million, respectively.

The loss ratio decreased 220 basis points, to 46.4%, during this period, primarily as a result of favorable loss experience in the Commercial Package insurance products.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses decreased by $1.5 million, or 3.3%, to $43.9 million mostly due to lower net commission expenses driven by a decrease in net premiums earned.

These proceeds were used to prepay the outstanding principal amount of $24.0 million of the 6.6% senior unsecured notes.\nIn August 2017 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $30.0 million repurchase program of its Class B common stock. Repurchases were conducted through open-market purchases of Class B shares only, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the year 2017, the Company repurchased and retired 861,415 shares of our Class B Common Stock shares at an average per share price of $23.38, for an aggregate cost of $20.2 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nCash flow from operating activities decreased by $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, principally as a result of higher claims paid by $257.4 million and an increase cash paid to suppliers and employees by $34.3 million, offset in part by an increase in premiums collections of $67.5 million. The increase in claims paid and premiums collected is principally the result of the change in the Medicaid delivery model from an ASO agreement to a fully insured model effective April 1, 2015.\nIncrease in net purchases of investments in securities are part of our asset/liability management strategy using cash on hand.\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayments of long-term borrowings decreased by $35.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the payment of a repurchase agreement of $25.0 million that matured and a $11.0 million repayment of principal of certain senior unsecured notes during the 2015 period.\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock amounted to $21.4 million reflecting the repurchase and retirement of 951,831 shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016 under the Corporation's Class B common stock repurchase programs.\nThe increase in other sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributed to changes in the amount of outstanding checks in excess of bank balances.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Company repurchases shares through open market transactions, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. Shares purchased under share repurchase programs are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. See Note 18, Stock Repurchase Program, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\nWe have several short-term facilities available to address timing differences between cash collections and disbursements. These short-term facilities are mostly in the form of arrangements to sell securities under repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2017, we had $60.0 million of available credit under these facilities. There are no outstanding short-term borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2017.\nOn December 28, 2016, TSM entered into a $35.5 million credit agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. The agreement consists of three term loans: (i) Term Loan A in the principal amount of $11.2 million, (ii) Term Loan B in the principal amount of $20.2 million and (iii) Term Loan C in the principal amount of $4.1 million. Term Loan A matures in October 2023 while the Term Loans B and C mature in January 2024. Term Loan A was used to refinance a previous $41.0 million secured loan payable with the same commercial bank. Pursuant to the credit agreement, interest is payable on the outstanding balance of the Loan at the following annual rate: (i) 1% over LIBOR for Term Loan A, (ii) 2.75% over LIBOR for Term Loan B, and (iii) 3.25% over LIBOR for Term Loan C. The loan includes certain financial and non-financial covenants, which are customary for this type of facility, including but not limited to, restrictions on the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and limitations on changes in control and dividends. Failure to meet these covenants may trigger the accelerated payment of the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2017 we are in compliance with these covenants.\nOn March 11, 2016 TSS entered into a $30.0 million revolving loan agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. This unused line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 220 basis points and contained certain financial and non-financial covenants that are customary for this type of facility. This revolving loan agreement matured on March 11, 2017, and was not renewed.\nOn April 18, 2017, TSA entered into a $10.0 million revolving loan agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. This line of credit has an interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 25 basis points, matures on April 17, 2018, and includes certain financial and non-financial covenants that are customary for this type of facility. As of December 31, 2017, there were $2.0 million outstanding in this line of credit.\nWe anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to support our currently expected needs.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations impact our short and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. However, our future cash flow prospects cannot be reasonably assessed based solely on such obligations. Future cash outflows, whether contractual or not, will vary based on our future needs. While some cash outflows are completely fixed (such as commitments to repay principal and interest on borrowings), most are dependent on future events (such as the payout pattern of claim liabilities which have been incurred but not reported).\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The table below describes the payments due under our contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, including the maturity profile of our debt, operating leases and other long-term liabilities, but excludes an estimate of the future cash outflows related to the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Alternative investments - The Company has $117.6 million of unfunded capital commitments related to alternative investments.

A significant portion of the estimated obligation for future policy benefits to be paid included in this table considers contracts under which we are currently not making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event not under our control, such as death, illness, or the surrender of a policy. We have estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience as well as expectations of future payment patterns. The amounts presented in the table above represent the estimated cash payments for benefits under such contracts based on assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and assumptions related to mortality, morbidity, policy lapses, renewals, retirements, disability incidence and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. All estimated cash payments included in this table are not discounted to present value nor do they take into account estimated future premiums on policies in-force as of December 31, 2017 and are gross of any reinsurance recoverable. The $657.9 million total estimated cash flows for all years in the table is different from the liability of future policy benefits of $339.5 million included in our audited consolidated financial statements principally due to the time value of money.

These regulations, among other things, require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed by the insurance subsidiaries to TSM. As of December 31, 2017, our insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with such minimum capital requirements.\nThese regulations are not directly applicable to TSM, as a holding company, since it is not an insurance company.\nThe $35.5 million credit agreement limits the amount of dividends or other distributions (including share repurchases) payable by the Corporation to $50 million per year.\nWe do not expect that any of the previously described dividend restrictions will have a significant effect on our ability to meet our cash obligations.\nSolvency Regulation\nTo monitor the solvency of the operations, the BCBSA requires us, TSS, TSA, and TSB to comply with certain specified levels of Risk Based Capital (\u201dRBC\u201d). RBC is designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company's adjusted surplus to its required surplus (RBC ratio). The RBC ratio reflects the risk profile of insurance companies. At December 31, 2017, TSM and TSS estimated RBC ratio was above the 375% minimum BCBSA RBC requirement to avoid monitoring. At December 31, 2017, TSA estimated RBC ratio was above the minimum BCBSA RBC requirement of 100% for smaller controlled affiliate.\nBCBSA's primary licensees could be subject to monitoring if, over a 6 or 12 month period, its RBC ratio declines by 80 or more points and which results in a level that is below 500%.\nOther Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nVarious litigation claims and assessments against us have arisen in the course of our business, including but not limited to, our activities as an insurer and employer. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Insurance, as well as other Federal, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica government authorities, regularly make inquiries and conduct audits concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGiven the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have an adverse effect on our operating results and/or cash flows. For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 23, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGuarantee Associations and Other Regulatory Commitments\nTo operate in Puerto Rico, insurance companies, such as our insurance subsidiaries, are required to participate in guarantee associations, which are organized to pay policyholders contractual benefits on behalf of insurers declared insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on a proportional basis, to all member insurers in the line of business in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. In accordance with insurance laws and regulations assessments are recoverable through policy surcharges. It is the opinion of management that any possible future guarantee association assessments will not have a material effect on our operating results and/or cash flows, although there is no ceiling on these payment obligations.\nPursuant to the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, our property and casualty insurance subsidiary is a member of Sindicato de Aseguradores para la Suscripci\u00f3n Conjunta de Seguros de Responsabilidad Profesional M\u00e9dico-Hospitalaria (SIMED). The syndicate was organized for the purpose of underwriting medical-hospital professional liability insurance. As a member, the property and casualty insurance segment shares risks with other member companies and, accordingly, is contingently liable in the event the syndicate cannot meet their obligations. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, no assessment or payment was made for this contingency. It is the opinion of management that any possible future syndicate assessments will not have a material effect on our operating results and/or cash flows, although there is no ceiling on these payment obligations.\nIn addition, our property and casualty insurance subsidiary is a member of the Compulsory Vehicle Liability Insurance Joint Underwriting Association (the Association\u201d). The Association was organized in 1997 to underwrite insurance coverage of motor vehicle property damage liability risks effective January 1, 1998. As a participant, the segment shares the risk proportionally with other members based on a formula established by the Insurance Code. During the years 2016 and 2015, the Association distributed to the Company an amount based on the good experience of the business amounting to $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In December 2015 the Association declared a special dividend of $21 million subject to a special tax of 15% that was retained upon distribution. This special dividend was paid in three installments during 2016. The share of the Property and Casualty segment in this special dividend was approximately $1.7 million, net of tax. In June 2017, the Association declared a special dividend of $70 million as authorized by a recent amendment to the Act creating the Association. The distribution was subject to a unique and special tax rate of 50% that was already paid to the Puerto Rico Treasury. The dividend net of tax is payable in December 2018. The share of the Property and Casualty segment in this distribution is $2.4 million\nThe Property and Casualty segment is also member of the Puerto Rico Fire and Allied Lines Underwriting Association and the Puerto Rico Auto Assign Plan. These entities periodically impose assessments to cover operations and other charges. The assessments recorded from these entities were $1 thousand in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nV. Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is an explanation of our accounting policies considered most significant by management. These accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information is known. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For all these policies, management cautions that future events may not necessarily develop as forecasted, and that the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Management believes that the amounts provided for these critical accounting estimates are adequate.\nClaim Liabilities\nClaim liabilities by segment as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 367.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and casualty insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 694.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,106.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement continually evaluates the potential impact of changes in the factors considered for its claim liabilities estimates, both positive and negative, and uses the results of these evaluations to adjust recorded claim liabilities and underwriting criteria. Our profitability depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage the amount of claims incurred, particularly those of the Managed Care segment and the losses arising from the Property and Casualty and Life Insurance segment. Management regularly reviews its premiums and benefits structure to reflect our underlying claims experience and revised actuarial data; however, several factors could adversely affect our underwriting results. Some of these factors are beyond management's control and could adversely affect its ability to accurately predict and effectively control claims incurred. Examples of such factors include changes in health practices, economic conditions, change in utilization trends including those caused by epidemic conditions, healthcare costs, the advent of natural disasters, and malpractice litigation. Costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe recognize claim liabilities as follows:\nManaged Care Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the managed care segment amounted to $367.0 million and represented 33.1% of our total consolidated claim liabilities and 16.6% of our total consolidated liabilities.\nClaim liabilities are determined employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by managed care actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice, which require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. The segment determines the amount of the liability by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project a best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical claims incurred dates are compared to actual dates of claims payment. This information is analyzed to create completion\u201d or development\u201d factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the total expected claims incurred. The majority of unpaid claims, both reported and unreported, for any period, are those claims which are incurred in the final months of the period. Since the percentage of claims paid during the period with respect to claims incurred in those months is generally very low, the above-described completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. In order to complement the analysis to determine the unpaid claims, historical completion factors and payment patterns are applied to incurred and paid claims for the most recent twelve months and compared to the prior twelve month period. Incurred claims for the most recent twelve months also take into account recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels (trend factors). Using all of the above methodologies, our actuaries determine based on the different circumstances the unpaid claims as of the end of period.\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed.\nManaged care claim liabilities also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is an estimate for known environmental factors that are reasonably likely to affect the required level of reserves. This provision for adverse deviation is intended to capture the potential adverse development from known environmental factors such as our entry into new geographical markets, changes in our geographic or product mix, the introduction of new customer populations, variation in benefit utilization, disease outbreaks, changes in provider reimbursement, fluctuations in medical cost trend, variation in claim submission patterns and variation in claims processing speed and payment patterns, changes in technology that provide faster access to claims data or change the speed of adjudication and settlement of claims, variability in claim inventory levels, non-standard claim development, and/or exceptional situations that require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims.\nCircumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in enrollment, utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, regulatory and legislative requirements, claim processing patterns, and claim submission patterns. A comparison or prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, but rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. Changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. The re-estimates or recasts are done monthly for the previous four calendar quarters. On average, about 92% of the claims are paid within three months after the last day of the month in which they were incurred and about 5% are within the next three months, for a total of 97% paid within six months after the last day of the month in which they were incurred.\nManagement regularly reviews its assumptions regarding claim liabilities and makes adjustments to claims incurred when necessary. If management's assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our consolidated statement of earnings and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Changes to prior year estimates may result in an increase in claims incurred or a reduction of claims incurred in the period the change is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities are made in each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior year development of claim liabilities is recognized immediately upon the actuary's judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. Health care trends are monitored in conjunction with the claim reserve analysis. Based on these analyses, rating trends are adjusted to anticipate future changes in health care cost or utilization. Thus, the managed care segment incorporates those trends as part of the development of premium rates in an effort to keep premium rating trends in line with claims trends.\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described above, completion factors and claims trend factors can have a significant impact on determination of our claim liabilities. The following example provides the estimated impact on our December 31, 2017 claim liabilities, assuming the indicated hypothetical changes in completion and trend factors:\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Completion Factor 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Claims Trend Factor 2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) Increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease) Increase\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In completion factor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> In unpaid claim\nliabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> In claims trend\nfactor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> In unpaid claim\nliabilities\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> -1.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> -0.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> -0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 0.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 1.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (17.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent twelve months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td> Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent twelve months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe segments' reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate as the ultimate liability for claims within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Management believes that the methodology for determining the best estimate for claim liabilities at each reporting date has been consistently applied.\nAmounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year-end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or run-out becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year-end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred claims related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The reverse is true of reserve shortfalls. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a short tail\u201d, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 93%, of any redundancy or shortfall relates to claims incurred in the previous calendar year-end, with the remaining 7% related to claims incurred prior to the previous calendar year-end. Management has not noted any significant emerging trends in claim frequency and severity and the normal fluctuations in enrollment and utilization trends from year to year.\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the variance between the segment's incurred claims for current period insured events and the incurred claims for such years had they been determined retrospectively (the Incurred claims related to current period insured events\u201d for the year shown plus or minus the Incurred claims related to prior period insured events\u201d for the following year as included in Note 10, Claim Liabilities and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). This table shows that the segments' estimates of this liability have approximated the actual development.\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total incurred claims:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As reported (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,356.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,216.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,665.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On a retrospective basis\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,343.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,207.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,645.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variance to total incurred claims as reported\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Includes total claims incurred less adjustments for prior year reserve development.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement expects that substantially all of the development of the 2017 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2018.\nIn the event this segment experiences an unexpected increase in health care cost or utilization trends, we have the following options to cover claim payments:\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> Through the management of our cash flows and investment portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> In the Commercial business we have the ability to increase the premium rates throughout the year in the monthly renewal process, when renegotiating the premiums for the following contract year of each group as they become due.

The estimate of claim liabilities for this segment is based on the amount of benefits contractually determined for reported claims, and on estimates based on past experience modified for current trends, for unreported claims. This estimate relies on observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events.\nClaim reserve reviews are generally conducted on a monthly basis, in light of continually updated information. We review reserves using current inventory of policies and claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods, judgments and analysis.\nThe key assumption with regard to claim liabilities for our life insurance segment is related to claims incurred prior to the end of the year, but not yet reported to our subsidiary. A liability for these claims is estimated based upon experience with regards to amounts reported subsequent to the close of business in prior years. There are uncertainties in the development of these estimates; however, in recent years our estimates have resulted in immaterial redundancies or deficiencies.\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the property and casualty insurance segment amounted to $694.4 million and represented 62.7% of the total consolidated claim liabilities and 31.5% of our total consolidated liabilities. Claims liabilities related to losses caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria amount to approximately $605 million.\nEstimates of the ultimate cost of claims and loss-adjustment expenses of this segment are based largely on the assumption that past developments, with appropriate adjustments due to known or unexpected changes, are a reasonable basis on which to predict future events and trends, and involve a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze current experience, trends and other relevant factors. Property and casualty insurance claim liabilities are categorized and tracked by line of business. Medical malpractice policies are written on a claims-made basis. Policies written on a claims-made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period. Other lines of business are written on an occurrence basis. Hurricane losses include the use of models from industry recognized firms having data, historical and current information about the events, to estimate ultimate losses. These estimates are supplemented by internal estimates of other costs deemed necessary to develop the ultimate losses.\nIndividual case estimates for reported claims are established by a claims adjuster and are changed as new information becomes available during the course of handling the claim. Our property and casualty business, other than medical malpractice, is primarily short-tailed business, where losses (e.g. paid losses and case reserves) are generally reported quickly.\nClaim reserve reviews are generally conducted on a quarterly basis, in light of continually updated information. Our actuary certifies reserves for both current and prior accident years using current claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods, judgments, and analysis. For each line of business, a variety of actuarial methods are used, with the final selections of ultimate losses that are appropriate for each line of business selected based on the current circumstances affecting that line of business. These selections incorporate input from management, particularly from the claims, underwriting and operations divisions, about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.\nKey assumptions are based on the consideration that past emergence of paid losses and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of future emergence and ultimate losses. A key assumption is the expected loss ratio for the current accident year. This expected loss ratio is generally determined through a review of the loss ratios of prior accident years and expected changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year. Another key assumption is the development patterns for paid and reported losses (also referred to as the loss emergence and settlement patterns). The reserves for unreported claims for each year are determined after reviewing the indications produced by each actuarial projection method, which, in turn, rely on the expected paid and reported development patterns and the expected loss ratio for that year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the actuarial reserve range determined by the actuaries was from $638 million to $760 million. Excluding Hurricanes losses, the range is $84 million to $99 million. Management reviews the results of the reserve estimates in order to determine any appropriate adjustments in the recording of reserves. Adjustments to reserve estimates are made after management's consideration of numerous factors, including but not limited to the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business. In general, changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Varying the net expected loss ratio by +/-1% in all lines of business for the six most recent accident years would increase/decrease the claims incurred by approximately $5.4 million.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nOur life insurance segment establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet its policy obligations when a policy matures or surrenders, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events. We compute the amounts for actuarial liabilities in conformity with GAAP.\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiabilities for future policy benefits for whole life and term insurance products and active life reserves for accident and health products are computed by the net level premium method, using interest assumptions ranging from 3.90% to 5.75% and withdrawal, mortality, morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions appropriate at the time the policies were issued (or when a block of business was purchased, as applicable). Accident and health unpaid claim reserves are stated at amounts determined by estimates on individual claims and estimates of unreported claims based on past experience. Deferred annuity reserves are carried at the account value.\nFor deferred annuities, the liability for future policy benefits is equal to total policy account values. The liabilities for all other products are based upon a variety of actuarial assumptions that are uncertain. The most significant of these assumptions is the level of anticipated death and health claims. Other assumptions that are less significant to the appropriate level of the liability for future policy benefits are anticipated policy persistency rates, investment yields, and operating expense levels. These are reviewed frequently by our subsidiary's external actuaries, to assure that the current level of liabilities for future policy benefits is sufficient, in combination with anticipated future cash flows, to provide for all contractual obligations. For all products, except for deferred annuities, the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time of issuance of each contract and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits. We do not currently expect that level of deterioration to occur.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nCertain costs for acquiring life and property and casualty insurance business are deferred. Acquisition costs related to the managed care business are expensed as incurred.\nThe costs of acquiring new life business, principally commissions, and certain variable underwriting and policy issue expenses of our life insurance segment, have been deferred. These costs, including value of business acquired ( VOBA\u201d) recorded upon our acquisitions of TSV and TSB, are amortized to income over the premium-paying period of the related whole life and term insurance policies in proportion to the ratio of the expected annual premium revenue to the expected total premium revenue, and over the anticipated lives of universal life policies in proportion to the ratio of the expected annual gross profits to the expected total gross profits. The expected premiums revenue and gross profits are based upon the same mortality and withdrawal assumptions used in determining the liability for future policy benefits. For universal life and deferred annuity policies, changes in the amount or timing of expected gross profits result in adjustments to the cumulative amortization of these costs. The effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of revisions to estimated gross profits is reported in earnings in the period such estimated gross profits are revised.\nThe schedules of amortization of life insurance deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) and VOBA are based upon actuarial assumptions regarding future events that are uncertain. For all products, other than universal life and deferred annuities, the most significant of these assumptions is the level of contract persistency and investment yield rates. For these products the basis for the amortization of DPAC and VOBA is established at the issue of each contract and would only change if our segment's experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the net liability is not adequate. We do not currently expect that level of deterioration to occur. For the universal life and deferred annuity products, amortization schedules are based upon the level of historic and anticipated gross profit margins, from the date of each contract's issued (or purchase, in the case of VOBA). These schedules are based upon several actuarial assumptions that are uncertain, are reviewed annually and are modified if necessary. The most significant of these assumptions are claims, investment yield rates and contract persistency. Based upon the most recent actuarial reviews of all of the assumptions, we do not currently anticipate material changes to the level of these amortization schedules.\nThe property and casualty business acquisition costs consist of commissions net of reinsurance commissions, during the production of business are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the policies. The method used in calculating deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to actual costs or their estimated realizable value, whichever is lower.\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of Investments\nImpairment of an investment exists if a decline in the estimated fair value is below the amortized cost of the security. Management regularly monitors and evaluates the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of investments. For investments with a fair value below cost, the process includes evaluating: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities, or cost for equity securities, (2) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions, (3) the Company's intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale prior to recovery, (4) the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities, or cost for equity securities, and (5) other factors, as applicable. This process is not exact and further requires consideration of risks such as credit and interest rate risks. Consequently, if an investment's cost exceeds its estimated fair value solely due to changes in interest rates, other-than temporary impairment may not be appropriate. Due to the subjective nature of our analysis, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that we could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if we had access to additional information about the investee. Additionally, it is possible that the investee's ability to meet future contractual obligations may be different than what we determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. If after monitoring and analyzing impaired securities, management determines that a decline in the estimated fair value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security below cost is other than temporary, the carrying amount of the security is reduced to its fair value according to current accounting guidance. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. For debt securities, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis may be accreted into net investment income in future periods based on prospective changes in cash flow estimates, to reflect adjustments to the effective yield.\nManagement reviews investment portfolios under our impairment review policy. Given current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. Management from time to time may sell investments as part of its asset/liability management process or to reposition its investment portfolio based on current and expected market conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment amounting to $49 thousands on equity securities classified as available for sale. The impairment analysis indicated that, none of the securities whose carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value was considered other-than-temporarily impaired as of that date; however, several factors are beyond management's control, such as the following: financial condition of the issuers, movement of interest rates, specific situations within corporations, among others. Over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the estimated fair value of certain securities, which could change management's judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses related to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income.\nOur fixed maturity securities are sensitive to interest rate and credit risk fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Our equity securities are sensitive to equity price risks, for which potential losses could arise from adverse changes in the value of equity securities.

Overview\nWe are one of the most significant players in the managed care industry in Puerto Rico and have over 55 years of experience in this industry. We offer a broad portfolio of managed care and related products in the Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage markets. In the Commercial market we offer products to corporate accounts, U.S. federal government employees, local government employees, individual accounts and Medicare Supplement. We also participate in the Government of Puerto Rico Health Reform (a managed care program for the medically indigent funded by the Puerto Rico and U.S. federal governments that is similar to the Medicaid program in the U.S.) (Medicaid). The Island is divided in eight regions and we served all of them on an administrative service only basis (ASO) until March 31, 2015. Effective April 1, 2015, the government changed the Medicaid delivery model from an ASO to a risk-based model and we elected to participate as a fully-insured provider in only two regions of Puerto Rico.\nWe have the exclusive right to use the BCBS name and mark throughout Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. As of December 31, 2017 we serve approximately 978,000 members across all regions of Puerto Rico. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively, our managed care segment represented approximately 92% of our total consolidated premiums earned, net. We also participate in the life insurance and property and casualty insurance markets in Puerto Rico.\nWe participate in the managed care market through our subsidiaries, TSS, TSB and TSA. TSS, TSA and TSB are BCBSA licensees.\nWe participate in the life insurance market through our subsidiary, TSV, and in the property and casualty insurance market through our subsidiary, TSP.\nThe Commissioner of Insurance of the Government of Puerto Rico ( Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico\u201d) recognizes only statutory accounting practices for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, for determining its solvency under the Puerto Rico insurance laws, and for determining whether its financial condition warrants the payment of a dividend to its stockholders. No consideration is given by the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in making such determinations. See Note 24, Statutory Accounting, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2017 Consolidated Highlights\nKey developments in our business during 2017 are described below:\n \u00b7 Consolidated premiums earned, net decreased 2.2% year over year, to $2.8 billion, primarily reflecting lower Managed Care and Property and Casualty premiums. \n \u00b7 The lower Managed Care premiums reflect lower membership in the segment's Medicaid and Commercial businesses, the impact of the suspension of the HIP fee pass through in 2017, and lower Medicare additional risk score revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher average premium rates in the Commercial and Medicaid businesses, as well as by higher Medicare membership. \n \u00b7 Consolidated claims for the year were $2.4 billion, down 4.8% over last year, primarily reflecting lower Managed Care membership, the ongoing improvement in our managed care operations, and the estimated decrease in the utilization of Managed Care services caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. These decreases were offset in part by the estimated $14.8 million net retained losses incurred by the Property and Casualty segment caused by the aforementioned Hurricanes. The consolidated loss ratio was down 230 basis points, to 83.2%, and the Medical Loss Ratio ( MLR\u201d) decreased 300 basis points, to 85.6%. \n \u00b7 Consolidated operating expenses for the year were $477.2 million and the operating expense ratio was 16.8%. \n \n \u00b7 Net income for the year was $54.5 million, an increase from a net income of $17.4 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in the Managed Care segment's MLR. \nOverview details\nIntersegment revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis in each of the operating segments but eliminated in the consolidated results. Except as otherwise indicated, the numbers presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect intersegment eliminations. These intersegment revenues and expenses affect the amounts reported on the financial statement line items for each segment, but are eliminated in consolidation and do not change net income. The following table shows premiums earned, net and net fee revenue and operating income for each segment, as well as the intersegment premiums earned, service revenues and other intersegment transactions, which are eliminated in the consolidated results:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,590.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,648.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,549.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 161.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 156.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 148.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and casualty insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 77.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intersegment premiums earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated premiums earned, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,826.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,890.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,783.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative service fees:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intersegment administrative service fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated administrative service fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and casualty insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intersegment and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nGeneral. Our revenue consists primarily of (i) premium revenue generated from our managed care business, (ii) administrative service fees received for services provided to self-insured employers, (iii) premiums we generate from our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses and (iv) investment income.\nPremium Revenue. Our revenue primarily consists of premiums earned from the sale of managed care products to the Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid sectors. We receive a monthly payment from or on behalf of each member enrolled in our managed care plans (excluding ASO). We recognize all premium revenue in our managed care business during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to an enrolled member. Premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as unearned premiums.\nPremiums are set prospectively, meaning that a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of each contract year and revised at renewal. We renegotiate the premiums of different groups as their existing annual contracts become due. Our Medicare Advantage contracts entitle us to premium payments from CMS on behalf of each Medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans, generally on a per member per month ( PMPM\u201d) basis. We submit rate proposals to CMS in June for each Medicare Advantage product that will be offered beginning January 1 of the subsequent year in accordance with the competitive bidding process under the MMA. Retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to our Medicare Advantage plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan participants. Premium rates for the Medicaid business are based on a bid contract with ASES and are revised each year to be effective each July 1, at which time rates are fixed for the plan year.\n \nPremiums on traditional life insurance policies are reported as earned when due. Premiums on accident and health and other short-term contracts are recognized as earned, primarily on a pro rata basis over the contract period. Premiums on credit life policies are recognized as earned in proportion to the amounts of insurance in force. Group insurance premiums are billed one month in advance and a grace period of one month is provided for premium payment. If the insured fails to pay within the one-month grace period, we may cancel the policy. We recognize premiums on property and casualty contracts as earned on a pro rata basis over the policy term. Property and casualty policies are subscribed through general agencies, which bill policy premiums to their clients in advance or, in the case of new business, at the inception date and remit collections to us, net of commissions. The portion of premiums related to the period prior to the end of coverage is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as unearned premiums and is transferred to premium revenue as earned.\nAdministrative Service Fees. Administrative service fees include amounts paid to us for administrative services provided to self-insured contracts. We provide a range of customer services pursuant to our administrative services only ( ASO\u201d) contracts, including claims administration, billing, access to our provider networks and membership services. Administrative service fees are recognized in the month in which services are provided.\nInvestment Income. Investment income consists of interest and dividend income from investment securities. See Note 4, Net Investment Income, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExpenses\nClaims Incurred. Our largest expense is medical claims incurred, or the cost of medical services we arrange for our members. Medical claims incurred include the payment of benefits and losses, mostly to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and other service providers, and to policyholders. We generally pay our providers on one of three forms: (1) fee-for-service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules; (2) capitation arrangements, generally on a fixed PMPM payment basis, whereby the provider generally assumes some of the medical expense risk; and (3) risk-sharing arrangements, whereby we advance a PMPM payment and share the risk of certain medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre-determined sharing ratios. Claims incurred also include claims incurred in our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses. Each segment's results of operations depend to a significant extent on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage claims and losses. A portion of the claims incurred for each period consists of claims reported but not paid during the period, as well as a management and actuarial estimate of claims incurred but not reported during the period.\nThe MLR, which is calculated by dividing managed care claims incurred by managed care premiums earned, net is one of our primary management tools for measuring these costs and their impact on our profitability. The MLR is affected by the cost and utilization of services. The cost of services is affected by many factors, in particular our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers. The cost of services is also influenced by inflation and new medical discoveries, including new prescription drugs, therapies and diagnostic procedures. Utilization rates, which reflect the extent to which beneficiaries utilize healthcare services, significantly influence our medical costs. The level of utilization of services depends in large part on the age, health and lifestyle of our members, among other factors. As the MLR is the ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned, net, it is affected not only by our ability to contain cost trends but also by our ability to increase premium rates to levels consistent with or above medical cost trends. We use MLRs both to monitor our management of healthcare costs and to make various business decisions, including what plans or benefits to offer and our selection of healthcare providers.\n \nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses include commissions to external brokers, general and administrative expenses, cost containment expenses such as case and disease management programs, and depreciation and amortization. The operating expense ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses by premiums earned, net plus administrative service fees. A significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed costs. Accordingly, it is important that we maintain certain level of volume of business in order to compensate for the fixed costs. Significant changes in our volume of business will affect our operating expense ratio and results of operations. We also have variable costs, which vary in proportion to changes in volume of business.\nII. Membership\nOur results of operations depend in large part on our ability to maintain or grow our membership. In addition to driving revenues, membership growth is necessary to successfully introduce new products, maintain an extensive network of providers and achieve economies of scale. Our ability to maintain or grow our membership is affected principally by the competitive environment, the economy, and general market conditions.\nThe following table sets forth selected membership data as of the dates set forth below:\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 475,026\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 509,157\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 547,634\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,451\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 110,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 123,888\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 384,462\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 397,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 422,922\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 977,939\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,017,372\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,094,444\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Commercial membership includes corporate accounts, self-funded employers, individual accounts, Medicare Supplement, federal government employees and local government employees. \n \nIII.

This decrease primarily reflects lower premiums in the Managed Care segment by $58.5 million mainly due to lower membership in the segment's Medicaid and Commercial businesses, the impact of the suspension of the HIP fee pass through, and lower Medicare additional risk score revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher average premium rates in the Commercial and Medicaid businesses as well as by higher Medicare membership. Property and Casualty premiums decreased by $10.7 million year over year, mostly reflecting the $9.2 million estimated catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement costs following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.\nAdministrative service fees decreased $1.4 million, or 7.8%, mainly due to lower membership enrolled in this business.\nNet investment income increased $2.7 million, or 5.5%, to $51.6 million mostly as a result of higher invested balances.\n \nClaims Incurred\nConsolidated claims incurred decreased by $119.1 million, or 4.8%, to $2.4 billion, mostly due to lower claims in the Managed Care segment offset by an increase in claims in the Property and Casualty segment. The decrease in Managed Care claims primarily reflects lower claims incurred across all businesses in the segment driven by the estimated decrease in utilization as a consequence of the aforementioned Hurricanes, lower enrollment in the Commercial and Medicaid enrollment, and favorable fluctuations in the prior period reserve developments in the Commercial and Medicare businesses. The Property and Casualty segment's estimated net retained losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria were approximately $14.8 million after the application of reinsurance. The consolidated loss ratio decreased by 230 basis points to 83.2%. Excluding the impact of prior-period reserve developments, and moving the Medicare risk score revenue and other revenue adjustments to the corresponding period, the Managed Care MLR for the year was 83.7%, 100 basis points lower than the same metric from the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased by $16.7 million, or 3.4%, to $477.2 million. The lower operating expenses are mostly the result of the decrease in the HIP Fee of $44.2 million due to the 2017 moratorium offset by increase in personnel costs, professional services, and business promotion expenses totaling approximately $30.4 million.\nIncome taxes\nConsolidated income taxes increased by $30.8 million, to a net expense of $24.5 million. The year over year change in income taxes primarily results from an increase in the taxable income from the Managed Care segment, which has a higher effective tax rate than our other segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net increased by $107.4 million, or 3.9%, to $2.9 billion. This increase primarily reflects higher premiums in the Managed Care segment by $99.0 million as a result of the change in the Medicaid service model effective April 1, 2015, from an ASO agreement to a fully insured model, and higher premium rates in the Commercial business. This increase was offset by lower member month enrollment in the Medicare and Commercial businesses and a decrease in the Medicare average premiums rates.\nAdministrative service fees decreased $26.8 million, or 60.0%, mostly as a result of the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract model. Total administrative fees related to the previous Medicaid ASO agreement during the 2015 period amounted to $24.3 million.\nNet investment income increased $3.7 million, or 8.2%, to $48.9 million mostly as a result of higher invested balances.\nClaims Incurred\nConsolidated claims incurred increased by $153.5 million, or 6.6%, to $2.5 billion, mostly due to higher claims in the Managed Care segment. This increase primarily reflects higher claims incurred in the segment's Medicaid business by $150.7 million after the contract changed to a fully insured model and the impact of Managed Care prior period reserve developments. The consolidated loss ratio increased by 220 basis points to 85.5%. Excluding the impact of prior period development, as well as moving the 2015 risk score revenue adjustments to its corresponding period, consolidated loss ratio was 84.1%, 70 basis points higher than last year.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased by $24.8 million, or 4.8%, to $493.9 million. The decrease reflects lower expenses following the change in the Medicaid membership after we elected to reduce the number of regions we serve, from eight regions under an ASO agreement to only two regions when the contract changed to a fully-insured model. The lower operating expenses also reflect a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, mostly due to the strengthening of the allowance for doubtful receivables in the 2015 period, lower payroll and related expenses resulting from accruals related to management changes and retirements impacting the 2015 period, as well as a $4.4 million expense related to settlement agreements entered with governmental agencies in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a new business-to-business tax implemented in Puerto Rico at the end of the third quarter 2015 and an increase in the Health Insurance Providers Fee, reflecting the at-risk Medicaid enrollment after the model changed in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the consolidated operating expense ratio decreased 130 basis points to 17.0%, as the result of the increase in premiums and lower expenses.\n \nIncome taxes\nConsolidated income taxes resulted in a benefit of $6.3 million. The tax benefit primarily results from the net effect of the following:\n \u2022 For the 2016 period the Managed Care segment, which has a higher effective tax rate than our other segments, incurred in a loss before taxes, resulting in the recording of a tax benefit during the period. \n \u2022 During the 2015 period, the Company executed a Closing Agreement between TSM and its subsidiaries and the Puerto Rico Treasury Department in connection with a local law that provided a temporary preferential tax rate in capital asset transactions. These events allowed the Company to record a $3.1 million benefit in the 2015 period resulting from the enacted lower taxable rate and the reassessment of the realizability of some of its deferred taxes. \n \u2022 The Property and Casualty segment reassessed the tax rate used to measure several temporary differences; as a consequence such rate was increased from 20% to 39%, resulting in an increase to its deferred tax expense of approximately $3.6 million in 2016 \n \nManaged Care Operating Results\nWe offer our products in the managed care segment to three distinct market sectors in Puerto Rico: Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid sectors represented 28.4%, 36.6% and 26.6% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively.\nTable 217: <table> <tr>

or 2.2%, to $2.6 billion. This decrease is principally the result of the following:\n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Commercial business decreased by $38.1 million, or 4.5%, to $803.3 million. This fluctuation primarily reflects lower fully-insured enrollment during the year of approximately 228,600 member months and $14.5 million related to the suspension of the HIP fee pass-through; offset by an increase in average premium rates of approximately 5%. \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicare business increased by $11.4 million, or 1.1%, to $1,035.3 million, primarily reflecting an increase in member months enrollment of approximately 63,100 lives. This increase is partially offset by lower additional risk score revenue by $30.9 million as well as lower average premium rates due to a reduction in the 2017 Medicare reimbursement rates. \n \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicaid business decreased by $31.8 million to $751.4 million. This decrease primarily reflects lower fully-insured member months enrollment by approximately 198,400 lives, $10.8 million related to the suspension of the HIP fee pass-through as a result of the 2017 moratorium and, the impact of the 2.5% excess profit accrual that increased 2016 premiums by $10.9 million. Decreases are partially offset by a $12.2 million increase in premium collections related to our compliance with the contract's quality incentive metrics and the impact of the new premium rates that were effective July 1st 2017, which increased average premium rates by approximately 9%. \nMedical Claims Incurred\nMedical claims incurred decreased by $129.2 million, or 5.5%, to $2.2 billion. The MLR of the segment decreased 300 basis points during the 2017 period, to 85.6%. These fluctuations are primarily attributed to the net effect of the following:\n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Commercial business decreased by $94.5 million, or 13.2%, during the 2017 period and its MLR, at 77.5%, was 770 basis points lower than the same period last year. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments, the Commercial MLR would have been 77.9%, 590 basis points lower than the adjusted MLR for last year, primarily reflecting the estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 as well as the ongoing claim trends that are lower than our premium trends following the continuity of our underwriting discipline. The estimated decrease in utilization related to the aforementioned hurricanes account for approximately 310 of the 590 basis-points decrease in the adjusted MLR. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicare business decreased by $16.6 million, or 1.8%, during the 2017 period and its MLR decreased by 260 basis points, to 87.7 %. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments in 2017 and 2016 and moving the additional risk score revenue adjustments to their corresponding period, the Medicare MLR would have been approximately 88.4%, about 80 basis points lower than last year. The estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria mitigated the impact of the higher trends in Part B drugs and pharmacy benefits experienced by this business as well as the improvement of benefits in 2017 products taking advantage of the HIP fee moratorium. The estimated decrease in utilization related to the aforementioned hurricanes lowered by approximately 270 basis points the adjusted MLR. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicaid business decreased by $18.2 million, or 2.6%, during the 2017 period and its MLR increased by 140 basis points, to 91.5%. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments in 2017 and 2016, as well as for the impact of the 2.5% excess profit accrual and this year's quality incentive premiums, the Medicaid MLR would have been approximately 91.8%, about 180 basis points higher than last year. The higher MLR primarily reflects increased pharmacy and outpatient claim trends, partially offset by the estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which lowered the adjusted MLR by 30 basis points, and the impact of the higher premium rates that were effective July 1st 2017. \nMedical Operating Expenses\nMedical operating expenses decreased by $20.4 million, or 5.4%, to $354.9 million. The operating expense ratio decreased by 50 basis points to 13.6% in 2017. The lower operating expenses and expense ratio are mostly the result of the decrease in the HIP Fee of $44.2 million due to the 2017 moratorium offset by increase in personnel costs, professional services and business promotion expenses totaling approximately $28.1 million.\n \nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nMedical Operating Revenues\nMedical premiums earned increased by $99.0 million, or 3.9%, to $2.6 billion. This increase is principally the result of the following:\n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Commercial business decreased by $3.2 million, or 0.4%, to $841.4 million primarily resulting from a decrease in fully-insured member months enrollment, partially offset by an approximately 5% year over year increase in average premium rates. \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicare business decreased by $73.8 million, or 6.7%, to $1,000 million. This fluctuation primarily results from lower risk score revenue as compared with 2015, lower member months enrollment, and a reduction in 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates. \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicaid business increased by $176.0 million to $783.2 million, primarily as the result of the change in the Medicaid service model, from an ASO agreement to a fully-insured model effective April 1, 2015. \nAdministrative service fees decreased by $26.9 million, or 54.6%, to $22.4 million mainly due to the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract effective April 1, 2015.\nMedical Claims Incurred\nMedical claims incurred increased by $150.8 million, or 6.9%, to $2.3 billion. The MLR of the segment increased 240 basis points during the 2016 period, to 88.6%. These fluctuations are primarily attributed to the net effect of the following:\n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Commercial business increased by $4.3 million, or 0.6%, during 2016, mostly reflecting the impact of prior period reserve developments, partially offset by lower member months enrollment. The Commercial MLR was 85.2%, which is 100 basis points higher than the MLR for the prior year. Excluding the effect of prior period reserve developments in 2016 and 2015, the MLR would have decreased by 270 basis points, reflecting the continuity of our underwriting discipline and premium trends higher than claims trends. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicare business decreased by $4.1 million, or 0.4%, during the 2016 period reflecting the previously mentioned decrease in membership and changes in benefit design included in 2016 products as the result of the decrease in reimbursement rates. This decrease is offset by unfavorable prior period reserve developments. The Medicare MLR was 90.3%, which is 570 basis points higher than the MLR for the prior year. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments, and moving the 2015 final risk score revenue adjustments to its corresponding period, our Medicare MLR would have been 90.0%, about 530 basis points higher than last year. The higher MLR primarily reflects higher Part B drug costs mainly related to cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, additional deterioration in the experience of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and the effect of the decrease in 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicaid business increased by $150.7 million during the 2016 period reflecting the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract effective April 1, 2015. \nMedical Operating Expenses\nMedical operating expenses decreased by $18.1 million, or 4.6%, to $375.3 million. The decrease mostly reflects lower expenses following the change in the Medicaid membership after we elected to decrease the number of regions we serve, from eight regions under an ASO agreement to only two regions when the contract was changed to a fully-insured model. The lower operating expenses also includes the effect of a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, mostly due to the strengthening of the allowance for doubtful receivables in the 2015 period, lower payroll and related expenses resulting from accruals related to management changes and retirements impacting the 2015 period, as well as to a $4.4 million expense related to settlement agreements entered with governmental agencies in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a new business-to-business tax implemented in Puerto Rico at the end of the third quarter 2015 and an increase in the Health Insurance Providers Fee, reflecting the at-risk Medicaid enrollment after the model changed in 2015. The operating expense ratio increased 110 basis points to 14.0% in 2016 as a result of the increase in premiums and lower expenses.\n \nLife Insurance Operating Results\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 166.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed earned premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded premiums earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 161.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 156.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 148.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 186.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 181.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 172.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy benefits and claims incurred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 86.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 82.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting and other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 79.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 167.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 160.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 152.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additional data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 55.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 55.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 49.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net increased by $4.9 million, or 3.1% to $161.8 million, as the result of premium growth in the segment's Individual Life and Cancer lines of business, as well as growth in the Costa Rica operations.\nPolicy Benefits and Claims Incurred\nPolicy benefits and claims incurred increased by $0.4 million, or 0.5%, to $87.3 million, mostly reflecting a higher volume of business during the year, particularly in the Cancer and Individual Life lines of business, which claims increased by $2.7 million, offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in actuarial reserves.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nIncrease in underwriting and other expenses of $6.5 million, or 8.9%, to $79.9 million mostly reflects higher commissions following the segment's premium growth mentioned above.

The segment's operating expense ratio decreased 50 basis points to 46.8% in 2016, reflecting the increase in premiums during the period.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Operating Results\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums written\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 133.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums ceded\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (62.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (46.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (48.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 77.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 86.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Claims incurred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting and other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 41.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 43.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 84.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additional data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 65.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 49.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 51.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Revenues\nTotal premiums written increased by $10.7 million, or 8.0%, to $143.8 million, driven by higher sales of Commercial property and Commercial liability products, mainly as a result of the acquisition of a large account, as well as to higher sales of Personal package products.\n \nThe premiums ceded to reinsurers increased by $16.3 million, or 35.4%, mostly reflecting higher premiums written in Commercial insurance products during 2017 as well as adjustments related to the catastrophe reinsurance, including $9.2 million for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement costs.\nThe change in unearned premiums mostly reflects the segments higher premiums written in 2017.\nClaims Incurred\nClaims incurred increased by $10.0 million, or 24.5%, to $50.8 million mostly driven by $14.8 million of net losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. As a result, the segment's loss ratio increased by 1,940 basis points, to 65.8% during this period. Estimated gross losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria were $6.4 million and $687.0 million, respectively. While the segment's ultimate losses cannot be determined with certainty at this time, management believes the catastrophe coverage for losses and allocated loss expenses is sufficient to cover anticipated gross losses.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses decreased by $2.0 million, or 4.6%, to $41.9 million mostly due to lower personnel costs and net commissions. The operating expense ratio increased by 440 basis points, to 54.3% in 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Revenues\nTotal premiums written decreased by $1.3 million, or 1.0%, to $133.1 million, mostly resulting from lower sales of Commercial Package, offset by higher sales in the Compulsory Vehicle Liability insurance products.\nThe premiums ceded to reinsurers decreased by $2.7 million, or 5.5%, mostly reflecting favorable pricing in the market for nonproportional reinsurance treaties.\nClaims Incurred\nClaims incurred decreased by $1.8 million, or 4.2%, to $40.8 million. The loss ratio decreased 220 basis points, to 46.4%, during this period, primarily as a result of favorable loss experience in the Commercial Package insurance products.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses decreased by $1.5 million, or 3.3%, to $43.9 million mostly due to lower net commission expenses driven by a decrease in net premiums earned. The operating expense ratio decreased by 190 basis points, to 50.0% in 2016.\n \nIV. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nA summary of our major sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated is presented in the following table:\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sources (uses) of cash:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 229.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net purchases of investment securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (154.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (80.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (41.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net capital expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (21.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from long-term borrowoings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payments of long-term borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (27.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (37.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from policyholder deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surrenders of policyholder deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (22.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (21.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (18.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase and retirement of common stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (21.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (48.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (94.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nCash flow from operating activities increased by $279.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to, lower claims paid by $134.8 million, a decrease in cash paid to suppliers and employees of $191.6 million; offset by a decrease in premium collections of $55.1 million.\nIncrease in net purchases of investments in securities are part of our asset/liability management strategy using cash on hand.\nNet capital expenditures increased by $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 mostly related to information technology initiatives in the Managed Care segment.\nDuring the year 2017, we received the remaining $24.3 million from a loan with a commercial bank related with a credit agreement entered into in December 2016. These proceeds were used to prepay the outstanding principal amount of $24.0 million of the 6.6% senior unsecured notes.\nIn August 2017 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $30.0 million repurchase program of its Class B common stock. Repurchases were conducted through open-market purchases of Class B shares only, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the year 2017, the Company repurchased and retired 861,415 shares of our Class B Common Stock shares at an average per share price of $23.38, for an aggregate cost of $20.2 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nCash flow from operating activities decreased by $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, principally as a result of higher claims paid by $257.4 million and an increase cash paid to suppliers and employees by $34.3 million, offset in part by an increase in premiums collections of $67.5 million. The increase in claims paid and premiums collected is principally the result of the change in the Medicaid delivery model from an ASO agreement to a fully insured model effective April 1, 2015.\nIncrease in net purchases of investments in securities are part of our asset/liability management strategy using cash on hand.\n \nPayments of long-term borrowings decreased by $35.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the payment of a repurchase agreement of $25.0 million that matured and a $11.0 million repayment of principal of certain senior unsecured notes during the 2015 period.\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock amounted to $21.4 million reflecting the repurchase and retirement of 951,831 shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016 under the Corporation's Class B common stock repurchase programs.\nThe increase in other sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributed to changes in the amount of outstanding checks in excess of bank balances.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Company repurchases shares through open market transactions, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. Shares purchased under share repurchase programs are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. See Note 18, Stock Repurchase Program, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\nWe have several short-term facilities available to address timing differences between cash collections and disbursements. These short-term facilities are mostly in the form of arrangements to sell securities under repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2017, we had $60.0 million of available credit under these facilities. There are no outstanding short-term borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2017.\nOn December 28, 2016, TSM entered into a $35.5 million credit agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. The agreement consists of three term loans: (i) Term Loan A in the principal amount of $11.2 million, (ii) Term Loan B in the principal amount of $20.2 million and (iii) Term Loan C in the principal amount of $4.1 million. Term Loan A matures in October 2023 while the Term Loans B and C mature in January 2024. Term Loan A was used to refinance a previous $41.0 million secured loan payable with the same commercial bank. Pursuant to the credit agreement, interest is payable on the outstanding balance of the Loan at the following annual rate: (i) 1% over LIBOR for Term Loan A, (ii) 2.75% over LIBOR for Term Loan B, and (iii) 3.25% over LIBOR for Term Loan C. The loan includes certain financial and non-financial covenants, which are customary for this type of facility, including but not limited to, restrictions on the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and limitations on changes in control and dividends. Failure to meet these covenants may trigger the accelerated payment of the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2017 we are in compliance with these covenants.\nOn March 11, 2016 TSS entered into a $30.0 million revolving loan agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. This unused line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 220 basis points and contained certain financial and non-financial covenants that are customary for this type of facility. This revolving loan agreement matured on March 11, 2017, and was not renewed.\nOn April 18, 2017, TSA entered into a $10.0 million revolving loan agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. This line of credit has an interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 25 basis points, matures on April 17, 2018, and includes certain financial and non-financial covenants that are customary for this type of facility. As of December 31, 2017, there were $2.0 million outstanding in this line of credit.\nWe anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to support our currently expected needs.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations impact our short and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. However, our future cash flow prospects cannot be reasonably assessed based solely on such obligations. Future cash outflows, whether contractual or not, will vary based on our future needs. While some cash outflows are completely fixed (such as commitments to repay principal and interest on borrowings), most are dependent on future events (such as the payout pattern of claim liabilities which have been incurred but not reported).\n \n \u00b7 The table below describes the payments due under our contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, including the maturity profile of our debt, operating leases and other long-term liabilities, but excludes an estimate of the future cash outflows related to the following: \n o Alternative investments - The Company has $117.6 million of unfunded capital commitments related to alternative investments. These commitments were excluded from this disclosure due to the undeterminate nature of their cash flows. \n o Unearned premiums - This amount accounts for the premiums collected prior to the end of coverage period and does not represent a future cash outflow. As of December 31, 2017, we had $86.3 million in unearned premiums. \n o Policyholder deposits - The cash outflows related to these instruments are not included because they do not have defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. There are currently no significant policyholder deposits in paying status. As of December 31, 2017, our policyholder deposits had a carrying amount of $176.5 million. \n o Other long-term liabilities - Due to the indeterminate nature of their cash outflows, $107.9 million of other long-term liabilities are not reflected in the following table, including $33.7 million of liability for pension benefits, $21.9 million in deferred tax liabilities, and $52.3 million in liabilities to the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Plan Program. \nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual obligations by year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term borrowings (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 297.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 236.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Claim liabilities (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 464.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 370.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 56.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated obligation for future policy benefits (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 657.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 133.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 116.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 108.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 102.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 101.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,469.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 747.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 223.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As of December 31, 2017, our long-term borrowings consist of a credit agreement entered with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. See the Financing and Financing Capacity\u201d section for additional information regarding our long-term borrowings. \n (2) Purchase obligations represent payments required by us under material agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and where all significant terms are specified, including: quantities to be purchased, price provisions and the timing of the transaction. Other purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business for which we are not liable are excluded from the table above. Estimated pension plan contributions amounting to $2.0 million were included within the total purchase obligations. However, this amount is an estimate which may be subject to change in view of the fact that contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance, regulatory and legal requirements and plan funding policy. \n (3) Claim liabilities represent the amount of our claims processed and incomplete as well as an estimate of the amount of incurred but not reported claims and loss-adjustment expenses. This amount does not include an estimate of claims to be incurred subsequent to December 31, 2017. The expected claims payments are an estimate and may differ materially from the actual claims payments made by us in the future. Also, claim liabilities are presented gross, and thus do not reflect the effects of reinsurance under which $642.5 million of reserves had been ceded at December 31, 2017. \n \n (4) Our life insurance segment establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet its policy obligations when a policy matures or surrenders, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events. A significant portion of the estimated obligation for future policy benefits to be paid included in this table considers contracts under which we are currently not making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event not under our control, such as death, illness, or the surrender of a policy. We have estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience as well as expectations of future payment patterns. The amounts presented in the table above represent the estimated cash payments for benefits under such contracts based on assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and assumptions related to mortality, morbidity, policy lapses, renewals, retirements, disability incidence and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. All estimated cash payments included in this table are not discounted to present value nor do they take into account estimated future premiums on policies in-force as of December 31, 2017 and are gross of any reinsurance recoverable. The $657.9 million total estimated cash flows for all years in the table is different from the liability of future policy benefits of $339.5 million included in our audited consolidated financial statements principally due to the time value of money. Actual cash payments to policyholders could differ significantly from the estimated cash payments as presented in this table due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the estimation of these payments. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRestriction on Certain Payments by the Corporation's Subsidiaries\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico. These regulations, among other things, require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed by the insurance subsidiaries to TSM. As of December 31, 2017, our insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with such minimum capital requirements.\nThese regulations are not directly applicable to TSM, as a holding company, since it is not an insurance company.\nThe $35.5 million credit agreement limits the amount of dividends or other distributions (including share repurchases) payable by the Corporation to $50 million per year.\nWe do not expect that any of the previously described dividend restrictions will have a significant effect on our ability to meet our cash obligations.\nSolvency Regulation\nTo monitor the solvency of the operations, the BCBSA requires us, TSS, TSA, and TSB to comply with certain specified levels of Risk Based Capital (\u201dRBC\u201d). RBC is designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company's adjusted surplus to its required surplus (RBC ratio). The RBC ratio reflects the risk profile of insurance companies. At December 31, 2017, TSM and TSS estimated RBC ratio was above the 375% minimum BCBSA RBC requirement to avoid monitoring. At December 31, 2017, TSA estimated RBC ratio was above the minimum BCBSA RBC requirement of 100% for smaller controlled affiliate.\nBCBSA's primary licensees could be subject to monitoring if, over a 6 or 12 month period, its RBC ratio declines by 80 or more points and which results in a level that is below 500%.\nOther Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nVarious litigation claims and assessments against us have arisen in the course of our business, including but not limited to, our activities as an insurer and employer. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Insurance, as well as other Federal, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica government authorities, regularly make inquiries and conduct audits concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.\n \nGiven the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have an adverse effect on our operating results and/or cash flows. For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 23, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGuarantee Associations and Other Regulatory Commitments\nTo operate in Puerto Rico, insurance companies, such as our insurance subsidiaries, are required to participate in guarantee associations, which are organized to pay policyholders contractual benefits on behalf of insurers declared insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on a proportional basis, to all member insurers in the line of business in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. In accordance with insurance laws and regulations assessments are recoverable through policy surcharges. It is the opinion of management that any possible future guarantee association assessments will not have a material effect on our operating results and/or cash flows, although there is no ceiling on these payment obligations.\nPursuant to the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, our property and casualty insurance subsidiary is a member of Sindicato de Aseguradores para la Suscripci\u00f3n Conjunta de Seguros de Responsabilidad Profesional M\u00e9dico-Hospitalaria (SIMED). The syndicate was organized for the purpose of underwriting medical-hospital professional liability insurance. As a member, the property and casualty insurance segment shares risks with other member companies and, accordingly, is contingently liable in the event the syndicate cannot meet their obligations. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, no assessment or payment was made for this contingency. It is the opinion of management that any possible future syndicate assessments will not have a material effect on our operating results and/or cash flows, although there is no ceiling on these payment obligations.\nIn addition, our property and casualty insurance subsidiary is a member of the Compulsory Vehicle Liability Insurance Joint Underwriting Association (the Association\u201d). The Association was organized in 1997 to underwrite insurance coverage of motor vehicle property damage liability risks effective January 1, 1998. As a participant, the segment shares the risk proportionally with other members based on a formula established by the Insurance Code. During the years 2016 and 2015, the Association distributed to the Company an amount based on the good experience of the business amounting to $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In December 2015 the Association declared a special dividend of $21 million subject to a special tax of 15% that was retained upon distribution. This special dividend was paid in three installments during 2016. The share of the Property and Casualty segment in this special dividend was approximately $1.7 million, net of tax. In June 2017, the Association declared a special dividend of $70 million as authorized by a recent amendment to the Act creating the Association. The distribution was subject to a unique and special tax rate of 50% that was already paid to the Puerto Rico Treasury. The dividend net of tax is payable in December 2018. The share of the Property and Casualty segment in this distribution is $2.4 million\nThe Property and Casualty segment is also member of the Puerto Rico Fire and Allied Lines Underwriting Association and the Puerto Rico Auto Assign Plan. These entities periodically impose assessments to cover operations and other charges. The assessments recorded from these entities were $1 thousand in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nV. Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is an explanation of our accounting policies considered most significant by management. These accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information is known. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n \nThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For all these policies, management cautions that future events may not necessarily develop as forecasted, and that the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Management believes that the amounts provided for these critical accounting estimates are adequate.\nClaim Liabilities\nClaim liabilities by segment as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 367.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and casualty insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 694.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,106.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement continually evaluates the potential impact of changes in the factors considered for its claim liabilities estimates, both positive and negative, and uses the results of these evaluations to adjust recorded claim liabilities and underwriting criteria. Our profitability depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage the amount of claims incurred, particularly those of the Managed Care segment and the losses arising from the Property and Casualty and Life Insurance segment. Management regularly reviews its premiums and benefits structure to reflect our underlying claims experience and revised actuarial data; however, several factors could adversely affect our underwriting results. Some of these factors are beyond management's control and could adversely affect its ability to accurately predict and effectively control claims incurred. Examples of such factors include changes in health practices, economic conditions, change in utilization trends including those caused by epidemic conditions, healthcare costs, the advent of natural disasters, and malpractice litigation. Costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe recognize claim liabilities as follows:\nManaged Care Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the managed care segment amounted to $367.0 million and represented 33.1% of our total consolidated claim liabilities and 16.6% of our total consolidated liabilities.\nClaim liabilities are determined employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by managed care actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice, which require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. The segment determines the amount of the liability by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project a best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical claims incurred dates are compared to actual dates of claims payment. This information is analyzed to create completion\u201d or development\u201d factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the total expected claims incurred. The majority of unpaid claims, both reported and unreported, for any period, are those claims which are incurred in the final months of the period. Since the percentage of claims paid during the period with respect to claims incurred in those months is generally very low, the above-described completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. In order to complement the analysis to determine the unpaid claims, historical completion factors and payment patterns are applied to incurred and paid claims for the most recent twelve months and compared to the prior twelve month period. Incurred claims for the most recent twelve months also take into account recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels (trend factors). Using all of the above methodologies, our actuaries determine based on the different circumstances the unpaid claims as of the end of period.\n \nBecause the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed.\nManaged care claim liabilities also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is an estimate for known environmental factors that are reasonably likely to affect the required level of reserves. This provision for adverse deviation is intended to capture the potential adverse development from known environmental factors such as our entry into new geographical markets, changes in our geographic or product mix, the introduction of new customer populations, variation in benefit utilization, disease outbreaks, changes in provider reimbursement, fluctuations in medical cost trend, variation in claim submission patterns and variation in claims processing speed and payment patterns, changes in technology that provide faster access to claims data or change the speed of adjudication and settlement of claims, variability in claim inventory levels, non-standard claim development, and/or exceptional situations that require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims.\nCircumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in enrollment, utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, regulatory and legislative requirements, claim processing patterns, and claim submission patterns. A comparison or prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, but rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. Changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. The re-estimates or recasts are done monthly for the previous four calendar quarters. On average, about 92% of the claims are paid within three months after the last day of the month in which they were incurred and about 5% are within the next three months, for a total of 97% paid within six months after the last day of the month in which they were incurred.\nManagement regularly reviews its assumptions regarding claim liabilities and makes adjustments to claims incurred when necessary. If management's assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our consolidated statement of earnings and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Changes to prior year estimates may result in an increase in claims incurred or a reduction of claims incurred in the period the change is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities are made in each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior year development of claim liabilities is recognized immediately upon the actuary's judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. Health care trends are monitored in conjunction with the claim reserve analysis. Based on these analyses, rating trends are adjusted to anticipate future changes in health care cost or utilization. Thus, the managed care segment incorporates those trends as part of the development of premium rates in an effort to keep premium rating trends in line with claims trends.\n \nAs described above, completion factors and claims trend factors can have a significant impact on determination of our claim liabilities. The following example provides the estimated impact on our December 31, 2017 claim liabilities, assuming the indicated hypothetical changes in completion and trend factors:\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Completion Factor 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Claims Trend Factor 2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) Increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease) Increase\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In completion factor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> In unpaid claim\nliabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> In claims trend\nfactor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> In unpaid claim\nliabilities\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> -1.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> -0.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> -0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 0.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 1.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (17.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent twelve months. \n (2) Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent twelve months. \nThe segments' reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate as the ultimate liability for claims within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Management believes that the methodology for determining the best estimate for claim liabilities at each reporting date has been consistently applied.\nAmounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year-end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or run-out becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year-end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred claims related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The reverse is true of reserve shortfalls. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a short tail\u201d, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 93%, of any redundancy or shortfall relates to claims incurred in the previous calendar year-end, with the remaining 7% related to claims incurred prior to the previous calendar year-end. Management has not noted any significant emerging trends in claim frequency and severity and the normal fluctuations in enrollment and utilization trends from year to year.\n \nThe following table shows the variance between the segment's incurred claims for current period insured events and the incurred claims for such years had they been determined retrospectively (the Incurred claims related to current period insured events\u201d for the year shown plus or minus the Incurred claims related to prior period insured events\u201d for the following year as included in Note 10, Claim Liabilities and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). This table shows that the segments' estimates of this liability have approximated the actual development.\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total incurred claims:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As reported (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,356.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,216.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,665.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On a retrospective basis\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,343.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,207.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,645.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variance to total incurred claims as reported\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes total claims incurred less adjustments for prior year reserve development. \nManagement expects that substantially all of the development of the 2017 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2018.\nIn the event this segment experiences an unexpected increase in health care cost or utilization trends, we have the following options to cover claim payments:\n \u00b7 Through the management of our cash flows and investment portfolio. \n \u00b7 In the Commercial business we have the ability to increase the premium rates throughout the year in the monthly renewal process, when renegotiating the premiums for the following contract year of each group as they become due. We consider the actual claims trend of each group when determining the premium rates for the following contract year. \n \u00b7 We have available short-term borrowing facilities that from time to time address differences between cash receipts and disbursements. \nFor additional information on our credit facilities, see section Financing and Financing Capacity\u201d of this Item.\nLife Insurance Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the life insurance segment amounted to $45.5 million and represented 4.1% of total consolidated claim liabilities and 2.1% of our total consolidated liabilities.\nThe claim liabilities related to the life insurance segment are based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP. The estimate of claim liabilities for this segment is based on the amount of benefits contractually determined for reported claims, and on estimates based on past experience modified for current trends, for unreported claims. This estimate relies on observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events.\nClaim reserve reviews are generally conducted on a monthly basis, in light of continually updated information. We review reserves using current inventory of policies and claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods, judgments and analysis.\nThe key assumption with regard to claim liabilities for our life insurance segment is related to claims incurred prior to the end of the year, but not yet reported to our subsidiary. A liability for these claims is estimated based upon experience with regards to amounts reported subsequent to the close of business in prior years. There are uncertainties in the development of these estimates; however, in recent years our estimates have resulted in immaterial redundancies or deficiencies.\n \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the property and casualty insurance segment amounted to $694.4 million and represented 62.7% of the total consolidated claim liabilities and 31.5% of our total consolidated liabilities. Claims liabilities related to losses caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria amount to approximately $605 million.\nEstimates of the ultimate cost of claims and loss-adjustment expenses of this segment are based largely on the assumption that past developments, with appropriate adjustments due to known or unexpected changes, are a reasonable basis on which to predict future events and trends, and involve a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze current experience, trends and other relevant factors. Property and casualty insurance claim liabilities are categorized and tracked by line of business. Medical malpractice policies are written on a claims-made basis. Policies written on a claims-made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period. Other lines of business are written on an occurrence basis. Hurricane losses include the use of models from industry recognized firms having data, historical and current information about the events, to estimate ultimate losses. These estimates are supplemented by internal estimates of other costs deemed necessary to develop the ultimate losses.\nIndividual case estimates for reported claims are established by a claims adjuster and are changed as new information becomes available during the course of handling the claim. Our property and casualty business, other than medical malpractice, is primarily short-tailed business, where losses (e.g. paid losses and case reserves) are generally reported quickly.\nClaim reserve reviews are generally conducted on a quarterly basis, in light of continually updated information. Our actuary certifies reserves for both current and prior accident years using current claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods, judgments, and analysis. For each line of business, a variety of actuarial methods are used, with the final selections of ultimate losses that are appropriate for each line of business selected based on the current circumstances affecting that line of business. These selections incorporate input from management, particularly from the claims, underwriting and operations divisions, about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.\nKey assumptions are based on the consideration that past emergence of paid losses and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of future emergence and ultimate losses. A key assumption is the expected loss ratio for the current accident year. This expected loss ratio is generally determined through a review of the loss ratios of prior accident years and expected changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year. Another key assumption is the development patterns for paid and reported losses (also referred to as the loss emergence and settlement patterns). The reserves for unreported claims for each year are determined after reviewing the indications produced by each actuarial projection method, which, in turn, rely on the expected paid and reported development patterns and the expected loss ratio for that year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the actuarial reserve range determined by the actuaries was from $638 million to $760 million. Excluding Hurricanes losses, the range is $84 million to $99 million. Management reviews the results of the reserve estimates in order to determine any appropriate adjustments in the recording of reserves. Adjustments to reserve estimates are made after management's consideration of numerous factors, including but not limited to the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business. In general, changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Varying the net expected loss ratio by +/-1% in all lines of business for the six most recent accident years would increase/decrease the claims incurred by approximately $5.4 million.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nOur life insurance segment establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet its policy obligations when a policy matures or surrenders, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events. We compute the amounts for actuarial liabilities in conformity with GAAP.\n \nLiabilities for future policy benefits for whole life and term insurance products and active life reserves for accident and health products are computed by the net level premium method, using interest assumptions ranging from 3.90% to 5.75% and withdrawal, mortality, morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions appropriate at the time the policies were issued (or when a block of business was purchased, as applicable). Accident and health unpaid claim reserves are stated at amounts determined by estimates on individual claims and estimates of unreported claims based on past experience. Deferred annuity reserves are carried at the account value.\nFor deferred annuities, the liability for future policy benefits is equal to total policy account values. The liabilities for all other products are based upon a variety of actuarial assumptions that are uncertain. The most significant of these assumptions is the level of anticipated death and health claims. Other assumptions that are less significant to the appropriate level of the liability for future policy benefits are anticipated policy persistency rates, investment yields, and operating expense levels. These are reviewed frequently by our subsidiary's external actuaries, to assure that the current level of liabilities for future policy benefits is sufficient, in combination with anticipated future cash flows, to provide for all contractual obligations. For all products, except for deferred annuities, the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time of issuance of each contract and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits. We do not currently expect that level of deterioration to occur.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nCertain costs for acquiring life and property and casualty insurance business are deferred. Acquisition costs related to the managed care business are expensed as incurred.\nThe costs of acquiring new life business, principally commissions, and certain variable underwriting and policy issue expenses of our life insurance segment, have been deferred. These costs, including value of business acquired ( VOBA\u201d) recorded upon our acquisitions of TSV and TSB, are amortized to income over the premium-paying period of the related whole life and term insurance policies in proportion to the ratio of the expected annual premium revenue to the expected total premium revenue, and over the anticipated lives of universal life policies in proportion to the ratio of the expected annual gross profits to the expected total gross profits. The expected premiums revenue and gross profits are based upon the same mortality and withdrawal assumptions used in determining the liability for future policy benefits. For universal life and deferred annuity policies, changes in the amount or timing of expected gross profits result in adjustments to the cumulative amortization of these costs. The effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of revisions to estimated gross profits is reported in earnings in the period such estimated gross profits are revised.\nThe schedules of amortization of life insurance deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) and VOBA are based upon actuarial assumptions regarding future events that are uncertain. For all products, other than universal life and deferred annuities, the most significant of these assumptions is the level of contract persistency and investment yield rates. For these products the basis for the amortization of DPAC and VOBA is established at the issue of each contract and would only change if our segment's experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the net liability is not adequate. We do not currently expect that level of deterioration to occur. For the universal life and deferred annuity products, amortization schedules are based upon the level of historic and anticipated gross profit margins, from the date of each contract's issued (or purchase, in the case of VOBA). These schedules are based upon several actuarial assumptions that are uncertain, are reviewed annually and are modified if necessary. The most significant of these assumptions are claims, investment yield rates and contract persistency. Based upon the most recent actuarial reviews of all of the assumptions, we do not currently anticipate material changes to the level of these amortization schedules.\nThe property and casualty business acquisition costs consist of commissions net of reinsurance commissions, during the production of business are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the policies. The method used in calculating deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to actual costs or their estimated realizable value, whichever is lower.\n \nImpairment of Investments\nImpairment of an investment exists if a decline in the estimated fair value is below the amortized cost of the security. Management regularly monitors and evaluates the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of investments. For investments with a fair value below cost, the process includes evaluating: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities, or cost for equity securities, (2) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions, (3) the Company's intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale prior to recovery, (4) the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities, or cost for equity securities, and (5) other factors, as applicable. This process is not exact and further requires consideration of risks such as credit and interest rate risks. Consequently, if an investment's cost exceeds its estimated fair value solely due to changes in interest rates, other-than temporary impairment may not be appropriate. Due to the subjective nature of our analysis, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that we could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if we had access to additional information about the investee. Additionally, it is possible that the investee's ability to meet future contractual obligations may be different than what we determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. If after monitoring and analyzing impaired securities, management determines that a decline in the estimated fair value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security below cost is other than temporary, the carrying amount of the security is reduced to its fair value according to current accounting guidance. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. For debt securities, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis may be accreted into net investment income in future periods based on prospective changes in cash flow estimates, to reflect adjustments to the effective yield.\nManagement reviews investment portfolios under our impairment review policy. Given current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. Management from time to time may sell investments as part of its asset/liability management process or to reposition its investment portfolio based on current and expected market conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment amounting to $49 thousands on equity securities classified as available for sale. The impairment analysis indicated that, none of the securities whose carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value was considered other-than-temporarily impaired as of that date; however, several factors are beyond management's control, such as the following: financial condition of the issuers, movement of interest rates, specific situations within corporations, among others. Over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the estimated fair value of certain securities, which could change management's judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses related to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income.\nOur fixed maturity securities are sensitive to interest rate and credit risk fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Our equity securities are sensitive to equity price risks, for which potential losses could arise from adverse changes in the value of equity securities. For additional information on the sensitivity of our investments, see", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis financial discussion contains an analysis of our consolidated financial position and financial performance as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and consolidated results of operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015. References to the terms \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\" used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d), refer to TSM and unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. This analysis should be read in its entirety and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes and tables included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe structure of our MD&A is as follows:\n\n \nI. Overview\nWe are one of the most significant players in the managed care industry in Puerto Rico and have over 55 years of experience in this industry. We offer a broad portfolio of managed care and related products in the Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage markets. In the Commercial market we offer products to corporate accounts, U.S. federal government employees, local government employees, individual accounts and Medicare Supplement. We also participate in the Government of Puerto Rico Health Reform (a managed care program for the medically indigent funded by the Puerto Rico and U.S. federal governments that is similar to the Medicaid program in the U.S.) (Medicaid). The Island is divided in eight regions and we served all of them on an administrative service only basis (ASO) until March 31, 2015. Effective April 1, 2015, the government changed the Medicaid delivery model from an ASO to a risk-based model and we elected to participate as a fully-insured provider in only two regions of Puerto Rico.\nWe have the exclusive right to use the BCBS name and mark throughout Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. As of December 31, 2017 we serve approximately 978,000 members across all regions of Puerto Rico. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively, our managed care segment represented approximately 92% of our total consolidated premiums earned, net. We also participate in the life insurance and property and casualty insurance markets in Puerto Rico.\nWe participate in the managed care market through our subsidiaries, TSS, TSB and TSA. TSS, TSA and TSB are BCBSA licensees.\nWe participate in the life insurance market through our subsidiary, TSV, and in the property and casualty insurance market through our subsidiary, TSP.\nThe Commissioner of Insurance of the Government of Puerto Rico ( Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico\u201d) recognizes only statutory accounting practices for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, for determining its solvency under the Puerto Rico insurance laws, and for determining whether its financial condition warrants the payment of a dividend to its stockholders. No consideration is given by the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in making such determinations. See Note 24, Statutory Accounting, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2017 Consolidated Highlights\nKey developments in our business during 2017 are described below:\n \u00b7 Consolidated premiums earned, net decreased 2.2% year over year, to $2.8 billion, primarily reflecting lower Managed Care and Property and Casualty premiums. \n \u00b7 The lower Managed Care premiums reflect lower membership in the segment's Medicaid and Commercial businesses, the impact of the suspension of the HIP fee pass through in 2017, and lower Medicare additional risk score revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher average premium rates in the Commercial and Medicaid businesses, as well as by higher Medicare membership. \n \u00b7 Consolidated claims for the year were $2.4 billion, down 4.8% over last year, primarily reflecting lower Managed Care membership, the ongoing improvement in our managed care operations, and the estimated decrease in the utilization of Managed Care services caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. These decreases were offset in part by the estimated $14.8 million net retained losses incurred by the Property and Casualty segment caused by the aforementioned Hurricanes. The consolidated loss ratio was down 230 basis points, to 83.2%, and the Medical Loss Ratio ( MLR\u201d) decreased 300 basis points, to 85.6%. \n \u00b7 Consolidated operating expenses for the year were $477.2 million and the operating expense ratio was 16.8%. \n \n \u00b7 Net income for the year was $54.5 million, an increase from a net income of $17.4 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in the Managed Care segment's MLR. \nOverview details\nIntersegment revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis in each of the operating segments but eliminated in the consolidated results. Except as otherwise indicated, the numbers presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect intersegment eliminations. These intersegment revenues and expenses affect the amounts reported on the financial statement line items for each segment, but are eliminated in consolidation and do not change net income. The following table shows premiums earned, net and net fee revenue and operating income for each segment, as well as the intersegment premiums earned, service revenues and other intersegment transactions, which are eliminated in the consolidated results:\n\nRevenue\nGeneral. Our revenue consists primarily of (i) premium revenue generated from our managed care business, (ii) administrative service fees received for services provided to self-insured employers, (iii) premiums we generate from our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses and (iv) investment income.\nPremium Revenue. Our revenue primarily consists of premiums earned from the sale of managed care products to the Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid sectors. We receive a monthly payment from or on behalf of each member enrolled in our managed care plans (excluding ASO). We recognize all premium revenue in our managed care business during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to an enrolled member. Premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as unearned premiums.\nPremiums are set prospectively, meaning that a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of each contract year and revised at renewal. We renegotiate the premiums of different groups as their existing annual contracts become due. Our Medicare Advantage contracts entitle us to premium payments from CMS on behalf of each Medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans, generally on a per member per month ( PMPM\u201d) basis. We submit rate proposals to CMS in June for each Medicare Advantage product that will be offered beginning January 1 of the subsequent year in accordance with the competitive bidding process under the MMA. Retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to our Medicare Advantage plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan participants. Premium rates for the Medicaid business are based on a bid contract with ASES and are revised each year to be effective each July 1, at which time rates are fixed for the plan year.\n \nPremiums on traditional life insurance policies are reported as earned when due. Premiums on accident and health and other short-term contracts are recognized as earned, primarily on a pro rata basis over the contract period. Premiums on credit life policies are recognized as earned in proportion to the amounts of insurance in force. Group insurance premiums are billed one month in advance and a grace period of one month is provided for premium payment. If the insured fails to pay within the one-month grace period, we may cancel the policy. We recognize premiums on property and casualty contracts as earned on a pro rata basis over the policy term. Property and casualty policies are subscribed through general agencies, which bill policy premiums to their clients in advance or, in the case of new business, at the inception date and remit collections to us, net of commissions. The portion of premiums related to the period prior to the end of coverage is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as unearned premiums and is transferred to premium revenue as earned.\nAdministrative Service Fees. Administrative service fees include amounts paid to us for administrative services provided to self-insured contracts. We provide a range of customer services pursuant to our administrative services only ( ASO\u201d) contracts, including claims administration, billing, access to our provider networks and membership services. Administrative service fees are recognized in the month in which services are provided.\nInvestment Income. Investment income consists of interest and dividend income from investment securities. See Note 4, Net Investment Income, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExpenses\nClaims Incurred. Our largest expense is medical claims incurred, or the cost of medical services we arrange for our members. Medical claims incurred include the payment of benefits and losses, mostly to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and other service providers, and to policyholders. We generally pay our providers on one of three forms: (1) fee-for-service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules; (2) capitation arrangements, generally on a fixed PMPM payment basis, whereby the provider generally assumes some of the medical expense risk; and (3) risk-sharing arrangements, whereby we advance a PMPM payment and share the risk of certain medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre-determined sharing ratios. Claims incurred also include claims incurred in our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses. Each segment's results of operations depend to a significant extent on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage claims and losses. A portion of the claims incurred for each period consists of claims reported but not paid during the period, as well as a management and actuarial estimate of claims incurred but not reported during the period.\nThe MLR, which is calculated by dividing managed care claims incurred by managed care premiums earned, net is one of our primary management tools for measuring these costs and their impact on our profitability. The MLR is affected by the cost and utilization of services. The cost of services is affected by many factors, in particular our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers. The cost of services is also influenced by inflation and new medical discoveries, including new prescription drugs, therapies and diagnostic procedures. Utilization rates, which reflect the extent to which beneficiaries utilize healthcare services, significantly influence our medical costs. The level of utilization of services depends in large part on the age, health and lifestyle of our members, among other factors. As the MLR is the ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned, net, it is affected not only by our ability to contain cost trends but also by our ability to increase premium rates to levels consistent with or above medical cost trends. We use MLRs both to monitor our management of healthcare costs and to make various business decisions, including what plans or benefits to offer and our selection of healthcare providers.\n \nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses include commissions to external brokers, general and administrative expenses, cost containment expenses such as case and disease management programs, and depreciation and amortization. The operating expense ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses by premiums earned, net plus administrative service fees. A significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed costs. Accordingly, it is important that we maintain certain level of volume of business in order to compensate for the fixed costs. Significant changes in our volume of business will affect our operating expense ratio and results of operations. We also have variable costs, which vary in proportion to changes in volume of business.\nII. Membership\nOur results of operations depend in large part on our ability to maintain or grow our membership. In addition to driving revenues, membership growth is necessary to successfully introduce new products, maintain an extensive network of providers and achieve economies of scale. Our ability to maintain or grow our membership is affected principally by the competitive environment, the economy, and general market conditions.\nThe following table sets forth selected membership data as of the dates set forth below:\n\n (1) Commercial membership includes corporate accounts, self-funded employers, individual accounts, Medicare Supplement, federal government employees and local government employees. \n \nIII. Results of Operations\nConsolidated Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Further details of the results of operations of each reportable segment are included in the analysis of operating results for the respective segments.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net decreased by $63.7 million, or 2.2%, to $2.8 billion. This decrease primarily reflects lower premiums in the Managed Care segment by $58.5 million mainly due to lower membership in the segment's Medicaid and Commercial businesses, the impact of the suspension of the HIP fee pass through, and lower Medicare additional risk score revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher average premium rates in the Commercial and Medicaid businesses as well as by higher Medicare membership. Property and Casualty premiums decreased by $10.7 million year over year, mostly reflecting the $9.2 million estimated catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement costs following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.\nAdministrative service fees decreased $1.4 million, or 7.8%, mainly due to lower membership enrolled in this business.\nNet investment income increased $2.7 million, or 5.5%, to $51.6 million mostly as a result of higher invested balances.\n \nClaims Incurred\nConsolidated claims incurred decreased by $119.1 million, or 4.8%, to $2.4 billion, mostly due to lower claims in the Managed Care segment offset by an increase in claims in the Property and Casualty segment. The decrease in Managed Care claims primarily reflects lower claims incurred across all businesses in the segment driven by the estimated decrease in utilization as a consequence of the aforementioned Hurricanes, lower enrollment in the Commercial and Medicaid enrollment, and favorable fluctuations in the prior period reserve developments in the Commercial and Medicare businesses. The Property and Casualty segment's estimated net retained losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria were approximately $14.8 million after the application of reinsurance. The consolidated loss ratio decreased by 230 basis points to 83.2%. Excluding the impact of prior-period reserve developments, and moving the Medicare risk score revenue and other revenue adjustments to the corresponding period, the Managed Care MLR for the year was 83.7%, 100 basis points lower than the same metric from the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased by $16.7 million, or 3.4%, to $477.2 million. The lower operating expenses are mostly the result of the decrease in the HIP Fee of $44.2 million due to the 2017 moratorium offset by increase in personnel costs, professional services, and business promotion expenses totaling approximately $30.4 million.\nIncome taxes\nConsolidated income taxes increased by $30.8 million, to a net expense of $24.5 million. The year over year change in income taxes primarily results from an increase in the taxable income from the Managed Care segment, which has a higher effective tax rate than our other segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net increased by $107.4 million, or 3.9%, to $2.9 billion. This increase primarily reflects higher premiums in the Managed Care segment by $99.0 million as a result of the change in the Medicaid service model effective April 1, 2015, from an ASO agreement to a fully insured model, and higher premium rates in the Commercial business. This increase was offset by lower member month enrollment in the Medicare and Commercial businesses and a decrease in the Medicare average premiums rates.\nAdministrative service fees decreased $26.8 million, or 60.0%, mostly as a result of the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract model. Total administrative fees related to the previous Medicaid ASO agreement during the 2015 period amounted to $24.3 million.\nNet investment income increased $3.7 million, or 8.2%, to $48.9 million mostly as a result of higher invested balances.\nClaims Incurred\nConsolidated claims incurred increased by $153.5 million, or 6.6%, to $2.5 billion, mostly due to higher claims in the Managed Care segment. This increase primarily reflects higher claims incurred in the segment's Medicaid business by $150.7 million after the contract changed to a fully insured model and the impact of Managed Care prior period reserve developments. The consolidated loss ratio increased by 220 basis points to 85.5%. Excluding the impact of prior period development, as well as moving the 2015 risk score revenue adjustments to its corresponding period, consolidated loss ratio was 84.1%, 70 basis points higher than last year.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased by $24.8 million, or 4.8%, to $493.9 million. The decrease reflects lower expenses following the change in the Medicaid membership after we elected to reduce the number of regions we serve, from eight regions under an ASO agreement to only two regions when the contract changed to a fully-insured model. The lower operating expenses also reflect a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, mostly due to the strengthening of the allowance for doubtful receivables in the 2015 period, lower payroll and related expenses resulting from accruals related to management changes and retirements impacting the 2015 period, as well as a $4.4 million expense related to settlement agreements entered with governmental agencies in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a new business-to-business tax implemented in Puerto Rico at the end of the third quarter 2015 and an increase in the Health Insurance Providers Fee, reflecting the at-risk Medicaid enrollment after the model changed in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the consolidated operating expense ratio decreased 130 basis points to 17.0%, as the result of the increase in premiums and lower expenses.\n \nIncome taxes\nConsolidated income taxes resulted in a benefit of $6.3 million. The tax benefit primarily results from the net effect of the following:\n \u2022 For the 2016 period the Managed Care segment, which has a higher effective tax rate than our other segments, incurred in a loss before taxes, resulting in the recording of a tax benefit during the period. \n \u2022 During the 2015 period, the Company executed a Closing Agreement between TSM and its subsidiaries and the Puerto Rico Treasury Department in connection with a local law that provided a temporary preferential tax rate in capital asset transactions. These events allowed the Company to record a $3.1 million benefit in the 2015 period resulting from the enacted lower taxable rate and the reassessment of the realizability of some of its deferred taxes. \n \u2022 The Property and Casualty segment reassessed the tax rate used to measure several temporary differences; as a consequence such rate was increased from 20% to 39%, resulting in an increase to its deferred tax expense of approximately $3.6 million in 2016 \n \nManaged Care Operating Results\nWe offer our products in the managed care segment to three distinct market sectors in Puerto Rico: Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid sectors represented 28.4%, 36.6% and 26.6% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nMedical Operating Revenues\nMedical premiums earned decreased by $58.5 million, or 2.2%, to $2.6 billion. This decrease is principally the result of the following:\n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Commercial business decreased by $38.1 million, or 4.5%, to $803.3 million. This fluctuation primarily reflects lower fully-insured enrollment during the year of approximately 228,600 member months and $14.5 million related to the suspension of the HIP fee pass-through; offset by an increase in average premium rates of approximately 5%. \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicare business increased by $11.4 million, or 1.1%, to $1,035.3 million, primarily reflecting an increase in member months enrollment of approximately 63,100 lives. This increase is partially offset by lower additional risk score revenue by $30.9 million as well as lower average premium rates due to a reduction in the 2017 Medicare reimbursement rates. \n \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicaid business decreased by $31.8 million to $751.4 million. This decrease primarily reflects lower fully-insured member months enrollment by approximately 198,400 lives, $10.8 million related to the suspension of the HIP fee pass-through as a result of the 2017 moratorium and, the impact of the 2.5% excess profit accrual that increased 2016 premiums by $10.9 million. Decreases are partially offset by a $12.2 million increase in premium collections related to our compliance with the contract's quality incentive metrics and the impact of the new premium rates that were effective July 1st 2017, which increased average premium rates by approximately 9%. \nMedical Claims Incurred\nMedical claims incurred decreased by $129.2 million, or 5.5%, to $2.2 billion. The MLR of the segment decreased 300 basis points during the 2017 period, to 85.6%. These fluctuations are primarily attributed to the net effect of the following:\n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Commercial business decreased by $94.5 million, or 13.2%, during the 2017 period and its MLR, at 77.5%, was 770 basis points lower than the same period last year. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments, the Commercial MLR would have been 77.9%, 590 basis points lower than the adjusted MLR for last year, primarily reflecting the estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 as well as the ongoing claim trends that are lower than our premium trends following the continuity of our underwriting discipline. The estimated decrease in utilization related to the aforementioned hurricanes account for approximately 310 of the 590 basis-points decrease in the adjusted MLR. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicare business decreased by $16.6 million, or 1.8%, during the 2017 period and its MLR decreased by 260 basis points, to 87.7 %. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments in 2017 and 2016 and moving the additional risk score revenue adjustments to their corresponding period, the Medicare MLR would have been approximately 88.4%, about 80 basis points lower than last year. The estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria mitigated the impact of the higher trends in Part B drugs and pharmacy benefits experienced by this business as well as the improvement of benefits in 2017 products taking advantage of the HIP fee moratorium. The estimated decrease in utilization related to the aforementioned hurricanes lowered by approximately 270 basis points the adjusted MLR. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicaid business decreased by $18.2 million, or 2.6%, during the 2017 period and its MLR increased by 140 basis points, to 91.5%. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments in 2017 and 2016, as well as for the impact of the 2.5% excess profit accrual and this year's quality incentive premiums, the Medicaid MLR would have been approximately 91.8%, about 180 basis points higher than last year. The higher MLR primarily reflects increased pharmacy and outpatient claim trends, partially offset by the estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which lowered the adjusted MLR by 30 basis points, and the impact of the higher premium rates that were effective July 1st 2017. \nMedical Operating Expenses\nMedical operating expenses decreased by $20.4 million, or 5.4%, to $354.9 million. The operating expense ratio decreased by 50 basis points to 13.6% in 2017. The lower operating expenses and expense ratio are mostly the result of the decrease in the HIP Fee of $44.2 million due to the 2017 moratorium offset by increase in personnel costs, professional services and business promotion expenses totaling approximately $28.1 million.\n \nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nMedical Operating Revenues\nMedical premiums earned increased by $99.0 million, or 3.9%, to $2.6 billion. This increase is principally the result of the following:\n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Commercial business decreased by $3.2 million, or 0.4%, to $841.4 million primarily resulting from a decrease in fully-insured member months enrollment, partially offset by an approximately 5% year over year increase in average premium rates. \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicare business decreased by $73.8 million, or 6.7%, to $1,000 million. This fluctuation primarily results from lower risk score revenue as compared with 2015, lower member months enrollment, and a reduction in 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates. \n \u00b7 Medical premiums generated by the Medicaid business increased by $176.0 million to $783.2 million, primarily as the result of the change in the Medicaid service model, from an ASO agreement to a fully-insured model effective April 1, 2015. \nAdministrative service fees decreased by $26.9 million, or 54.6%, to $22.4 million mainly due to the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract effective April 1, 2015.\nMedical Claims Incurred\nMedical claims incurred increased by $150.8 million, or 6.9%, to $2.3 billion. The MLR of the segment increased 240 basis points during the 2016 period, to 88.6%. These fluctuations are primarily attributed to the net effect of the following:\n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Commercial business increased by $4.3 million, or 0.6%, during 2016, mostly reflecting the impact of prior period reserve developments, partially offset by lower member months enrollment. The Commercial MLR was 85.2%, which is 100 basis points higher than the MLR for the prior year. Excluding the effect of prior period reserve developments in 2016 and 2015, the MLR would have decreased by 270 basis points, reflecting the continuity of our underwriting discipline and premium trends higher than claims trends. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicare business decreased by $4.1 million, or 0.4%, during the 2016 period reflecting the previously mentioned decrease in membership and changes in benefit design included in 2016 products as the result of the decrease in reimbursement rates. This decrease is offset by unfavorable prior period reserve developments. The Medicare MLR was 90.3%, which is 570 basis points higher than the MLR for the prior year. Adjusting for the effect of prior period reserve developments, and moving the 2015 final risk score revenue adjustments to its corresponding period, our Medicare MLR would have been 90.0%, about 530 basis points higher than last year. The higher MLR primarily reflects higher Part B drug costs mainly related to cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, additional deterioration in the experience of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and the effect of the decrease in 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates. \n \u00b7 The medical claims incurred of the Medicaid business increased by $150.7 million during the 2016 period reflecting the previously mentioned change in the Medicaid contract effective April 1, 2015. \nMedical Operating Expenses\nMedical operating expenses decreased by $18.1 million, or 4.6%, to $375.3 million. The decrease mostly reflects lower expenses following the change in the Medicaid membership after we elected to decrease the number of regions we serve, from eight regions under an ASO agreement to only two regions when the contract was changed to a fully-insured model. The lower operating expenses also includes the effect of a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, mostly due to the strengthening of the allowance for doubtful receivables in the 2015 period, lower payroll and related expenses resulting from accruals related to management changes and retirements impacting the 2015 period, as well as to a $4.4 million expense related to settlement agreements entered with governmental agencies in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a new business-to-business tax implemented in Puerto Rico at the end of the third quarter 2015 and an increase in the Health Insurance Providers Fee, reflecting the at-risk Medicaid enrollment after the model changed in 2015. The operating expense ratio increased 110 basis points to 14.0% in 2016 as a result of the increase in premiums and lower expenses.\n \nLife Insurance Operating Results\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net increased by $4.9 million, or 3.1% to $161.8 million, as the result of premium growth in the segment's Individual Life and Cancer lines of business, as well as growth in the Costa Rica operations.\nPolicy Benefits and Claims Incurred\nPolicy benefits and claims incurred increased by $0.4 million, or 0.5%, to $87.3 million, mostly reflecting a higher volume of business during the year, particularly in the Cancer and Individual Life lines of business, which claims increased by $2.7 million, offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in actuarial reserves.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nIncrease in underwriting and other expenses of $6.5 million, or 8.9%, to $79.9 million mostly reflects higher commissions following the segment's premium growth mentioned above. In addition, the segment has incurred in higher development and marketing expenses related to the expansion of the Costa Rica operations. As a result, the segment's operating expense ratio increased to 49.4%, or 260 basis points.\n \nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Revenues\nPremiums earned, net increased by $8.8 million, or 5.9% to $156.9 million, reflecting improved policy retention and higher sales in the segment's Individual Life and Cancer lines of business of $4.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, as well as growth in the Costa Rica operations.\nPolicy Benefits and Claims Incurred\nPolicy benefits and claims incurred increased by $4.3 million, or 5.2%, to $86.9 million, mostly reflecting a higher volume of business during the year, particularly in the Cancer line of business, which claims increased by $2.7 million, as well as to an increase of $2.6 million in actuarial reserves.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nUnderwriting and other expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 4.9%, primarily reflecting an increase in commissions expense following the segment's premium growth mentioned above. In addition, the segment has incurred in higher development and marketing expenses related to the development of the Costa Rica operations. The segment's operating expense ratio decreased 50 basis points to 46.8% in 2016, reflecting the increase in premiums during the period.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Operating Results\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Revenues\nTotal premiums written increased by $10.7 million, or 8.0%, to $143.8 million, driven by higher sales of Commercial property and Commercial liability products, mainly as a result of the acquisition of a large account, as well as to higher sales of Personal package products.\n \nThe premiums ceded to reinsurers increased by $16.3 million, or 35.4%, mostly reflecting higher premiums written in Commercial insurance products during 2017 as well as adjustments related to the catastrophe reinsurance, including $9.2 million for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement costs.\nThe change in unearned premiums mostly reflects the segments higher premiums written in 2017.\nClaims Incurred\nClaims incurred increased by $10.0 million, or 24.5%, to $50.8 million mostly driven by $14.8 million of net losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. As a result, the segment's loss ratio increased by 1,940 basis points, to 65.8% during this period. Estimated gross losses related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria were $6.4 million and $687.0 million, respectively. While the segment's ultimate losses cannot be determined with certainty at this time, management believes the catastrophe coverage for losses and allocated loss expenses is sufficient to cover anticipated gross losses.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses decreased by $2.0 million, or 4.6%, to $41.9 million mostly due to lower personnel costs and net commissions. The operating expense ratio increased by 440 basis points, to 54.3% in 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Revenues\nTotal premiums written decreased by $1.3 million, or 1.0%, to $133.1 million, mostly resulting from lower sales of Commercial Package, offset by higher sales in the Compulsory Vehicle Liability insurance products.\nThe premiums ceded to reinsurers decreased by $2.7 million, or 5.5%, mostly reflecting favorable pricing in the market for nonproportional reinsurance treaties.\nClaims Incurred\nClaims incurred decreased by $1.8 million, or 4.2%, to $40.8 million. The loss ratio decreased 220 basis points, to 46.4%, during this period, primarily as a result of favorable loss experience in the Commercial Package insurance products.\nUnderwriting and Other Expenses\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses decreased by $1.5 million, or 3.3%, to $43.9 million mostly due to lower net commission expenses driven by a decrease in net premiums earned. The operating expense ratio decreased by 190 basis points, to 50.0% in 2016.\n \nIV. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nA summary of our major sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated is presented in the following table:\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nCash flow from operating activities increased by $279.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to, lower claims paid by $134.8 million, a decrease in cash paid to suppliers and employees of $191.6 million; offset by a decrease in premium collections of $55.1 million.\nIncrease in net purchases of investments in securities are part of our asset/liability management strategy using cash on hand.\nNet capital expenditures increased by $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 mostly related to information technology initiatives in the Managed Care segment.\nDuring the year 2017, we received the remaining $24.3 million from a loan with a commercial bank related with a credit agreement entered into in December 2016. These proceeds were used to prepay the outstanding principal amount of $24.0 million of the 6.6% senior unsecured notes.\nIn August 2017 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $30.0 million repurchase program of its Class B common stock. Repurchases were conducted through open-market purchases of Class B shares only, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the year 2017, the Company repurchased and retired 861,415 shares of our Class B Common Stock shares at an average per share price of $23.38, for an aggregate cost of $20.2 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nCash flow from operating activities decreased by $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, principally as a result of higher claims paid by $257.4 million and an increase cash paid to suppliers and employees by $34.3 million, offset in part by an increase in premiums collections of $67.5 million. The increase in claims paid and premiums collected is principally the result of the change in the Medicaid delivery model from an ASO agreement to a fully insured model effective April 1, 2015.\nIncrease in net purchases of investments in securities are part of our asset/liability management strategy using cash on hand.\n \nPayments of long-term borrowings decreased by $35.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the payment of a repurchase agreement of $25.0 million that matured and a $11.0 million repayment of principal of certain senior unsecured notes during the 2015 period.\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock amounted to $21.4 million reflecting the repurchase and retirement of 951,831 shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016 under the Corporation's Class B common stock repurchase programs.\nThe increase in other sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributed to changes in the amount of outstanding checks in excess of bank balances.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Company repurchases shares through open market transactions, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. Shares purchased under share repurchase programs are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. See Note 18, Stock Repurchase Program, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\nWe have several short-term facilities available to address timing differences between cash collections and disbursements. These short-term facilities are mostly in the form of arrangements to sell securities under repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2017, we had $60.0 million of available credit under these facilities. There are no outstanding short-term borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2017.\nOn December 28, 2016, TSM entered into a $35.5 million credit agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. The agreement consists of three term loans: (i) Term Loan A in the principal amount of $11.2 million, (ii) Term Loan B in the principal amount of $20.2 million and (iii) Term Loan C in the principal amount of $4.1 million. Term Loan A matures in October 2023 while the Term Loans B and C mature in January 2024. Term Loan A was used to refinance a previous $41.0 million secured loan payable with the same commercial bank. Pursuant to the credit agreement, interest is payable on the outstanding balance of the Loan at the following annual rate: (i) 1% over LIBOR for Term Loan A, (ii) 2.75% over LIBOR for Term Loan B, and (iii) 3.25% over LIBOR for Term Loan C. The loan includes certain financial and non-financial covenants, which are customary for this type of facility, including but not limited to, restrictions on the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and limitations on changes in control and dividends. Failure to meet these covenants may trigger the accelerated payment of the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2017 we are in compliance with these covenants.\nOn March 11, 2016 TSS entered into a $30.0 million revolving loan agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. This unused line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 220 basis points and contained certain financial and non-financial covenants that are customary for this type of facility. This revolving loan agreement matured on March 11, 2017, and was not renewed.\nOn April 18, 2017, TSA entered into a $10.0 million revolving loan agreement with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. This line of credit has an interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 25 basis points, matures on April 17, 2018, and includes certain financial and non-financial covenants that are customary for this type of facility. As of December 31, 2017, there were $2.0 million outstanding in this line of credit.\nWe anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to support our currently expected needs.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations impact our short and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. However, our future cash flow prospects cannot be reasonably assessed based solely on such obligations. Future cash outflows, whether contractual or not, will vary based on our future needs. While some cash outflows are completely fixed (such as commitments to repay principal and interest on borrowings), most are dependent on future events (such as the payout pattern of claim liabilities which have been incurred but not reported).\n \n \u00b7 The table below describes the payments due under our contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, including the maturity profile of our debt, operating leases and other long-term liabilities, but excludes an estimate of the future cash outflows related to the following: \n o Alternative investments - The Company has $117.6 million of unfunded capital commitments related to alternative investments. These commitments were excluded from this disclosure due to the undeterminate nature of their cash flows. \n o Unearned premiums - This amount accounts for the premiums collected prior to the end of coverage period and does not represent a future cash outflow. As of December 31, 2017, we had $86.3 million in unearned premiums. \n o Policyholder deposits - The cash outflows related to these instruments are not included because they do not have defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. There are currently no significant policyholder deposits in paying status. As of December 31, 2017, our policyholder deposits had a carrying amount of $176.5 million. \n o Other long-term liabilities - Due to the indeterminate nature of their cash outflows, $107.9 million of other long-term liabilities are not reflected in the following table, including $33.7 million of liability for pension benefits, $21.9 million in deferred tax liabilities, and $52.3 million in liabilities to the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Plan Program. \n\n (1) As of December 31, 2017, our long-term borrowings consist of a credit agreement entered with a commercial bank in Puerto Rico. See the Financing and Financing Capacity\u201d section for additional information regarding our long-term borrowings. \n (2) Purchase obligations represent payments required by us under material agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and where all significant terms are specified, including: quantities to be purchased, price provisions and the timing of the transaction. Other purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business for which we are not liable are excluded from the table above. Estimated pension plan contributions amounting to $2.0 million were included within the total purchase obligations. However, this amount is an estimate which may be subject to change in view of the fact that contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance, regulatory and legal requirements and plan funding policy. \n (3) Claim liabilities represent the amount of our claims processed and incomplete as well as an estimate of the amount of incurred but not reported claims and loss-adjustment expenses. This amount does not include an estimate of claims to be incurred subsequent to December 31, 2017. The expected claims payments are an estimate and may differ materially from the actual claims payments made by us in the future. Also, claim liabilities are presented gross, and thus do not reflect the effects of reinsurance under which $642.5 million of reserves had been ceded at December 31, 2017. \n \n (4) Our life insurance segment establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet its policy obligations when a policy matures or surrenders, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events. A significant portion of the estimated obligation for future policy benefits to be paid included in this table considers contracts under which we are currently not making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event not under our control, such as death, illness, or the surrender of a policy. We have estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience as well as expectations of future payment patterns. The amounts presented in the table above represent the estimated cash payments for benefits under such contracts based on assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and assumptions related to mortality, morbidity, policy lapses, renewals, retirements, disability incidence and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. All estimated cash payments included in this table are not discounted to present value nor do they take into account estimated future premiums on policies in-force as of December 31, 2017 and are gross of any reinsurance recoverable. The $657.9 million total estimated cash flows for all years in the table is different from the liability of future policy benefits of $339.5 million included in our audited consolidated financial statements principally due to the time value of money. Actual cash payments to policyholders could differ significantly from the estimated cash payments as presented in this table due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the estimation of these payments. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRestriction on Certain Payments by the Corporation's Subsidiaries\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico. These regulations, among other things, require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed by the insurance subsidiaries to TSM. As of December 31, 2017, our insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with such minimum capital requirements.\nThese regulations are not directly applicable to TSM, as a holding company, since it is not an insurance company.\nThe $35.5 million credit agreement limits the amount of dividends or other distributions (including share repurchases) payable by the Corporation to $50 million per year.\nWe do not expect that any of the previously described dividend restrictions will have a significant effect on our ability to meet our cash obligations.\nSolvency Regulation\nTo monitor the solvency of the operations, the BCBSA requires us, TSS, TSA, and TSB to comply with certain specified levels of Risk Based Capital (\u201dRBC\u201d). RBC is designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company's adjusted surplus to its required surplus (RBC ratio). The RBC ratio reflects the risk profile of insurance companies. At December 31, 2017, TSM and TSS estimated RBC ratio was above the 375% minimum BCBSA RBC requirement to avoid monitoring. At December 31, 2017, TSA estimated RBC ratio was above the minimum BCBSA RBC requirement of 100% for smaller controlled affiliate.\nBCBSA's primary licensees could be subject to monitoring if, over a 6 or 12 month period, its RBC ratio declines by 80 or more points and which results in a level that is below 500%.\nOther Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nVarious litigation claims and assessments against us have arisen in the course of our business, including but not limited to, our activities as an insurer and employer. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Insurance, as well as other Federal, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica government authorities, regularly make inquiries and conduct audits concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.\n \nGiven the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have an adverse effect on our operating results and/or cash flows. For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 23, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGuarantee Associations and Other Regulatory Commitments\nTo operate in Puerto Rico, insurance companies, such as our insurance subsidiaries, are required to participate in guarantee associations, which are organized to pay policyholders contractual benefits on behalf of insurers declared insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on a proportional basis, to all member insurers in the line of business in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. In accordance with insurance laws and regulations assessments are recoverable through policy surcharges. It is the opinion of management that any possible future guarantee association assessments will not have a material effect on our operating results and/or cash flows, although there is no ceiling on these payment obligations.\nPursuant to the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, our property and casualty insurance subsidiary is a member of Sindicato de Aseguradores para la Suscripci\u00f3n Conjunta de Seguros de Responsabilidad Profesional M\u00e9dico-Hospitalaria (SIMED). The syndicate was organized for the purpose of underwriting medical-hospital professional liability insurance. As a member, the property and casualty insurance segment shares risks with other member companies and, accordingly, is contingently liable in the event the syndicate cannot meet their obligations. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, no assessment or payment was made for this contingency. It is the opinion of management that any possible future syndicate assessments will not have a material effect on our operating results and/or cash flows, although there is no ceiling on these payment obligations.\nIn addition, our property and casualty insurance subsidiary is a member of the Compulsory Vehicle Liability Insurance Joint Underwriting Association (the Association\u201d). The Association was organized in 1997 to underwrite insurance coverage of motor vehicle property damage liability risks effective January 1, 1998. As a participant, the segment shares the risk proportionally with other members based on a formula established by the Insurance Code. During the years 2016 and 2015, the Association distributed to the Company an amount based on the good experience of the business amounting to $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In December 2015 the Association declared a special dividend of $21 million subject to a special tax of 15% that was retained upon distribution. This special dividend was paid in three installments during 2016. The share of the Property and Casualty segment in this special dividend was approximately $1.7 million, net of tax. In June 2017, the Association declared a special dividend of $70 million as authorized by a recent amendment to the Act creating the Association. The distribution was subject to a unique and special tax rate of 50% that was already paid to the Puerto Rico Treasury. The dividend net of tax is payable in December 2018. The share of the Property and Casualty segment in this distribution is $2.4 million\nThe Property and Casualty segment is also member of the Puerto Rico Fire and Allied Lines Underwriting Association and the Puerto Rico Auto Assign Plan. These entities periodically impose assessments to cover operations and other charges. The assessments recorded from these entities were $1 thousand in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nV. Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is an explanation of our accounting policies considered most significant by management. These accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information is known. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n \nThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For all these policies, management cautions that future events may not necessarily develop as forecasted, and that the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Management believes that the amounts provided for these critical accounting estimates are adequate.\nClaim Liabilities\nClaim liabilities by segment as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\n\nManagement continually evaluates the potential impact of changes in the factors considered for its claim liabilities estimates, both positive and negative, and uses the results of these evaluations to adjust recorded claim liabilities and underwriting criteria. Our profitability depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage the amount of claims incurred, particularly those of the Managed Care segment and the losses arising from the Property and Casualty and Life Insurance segment. Management regularly reviews its premiums and benefits structure to reflect our underlying claims experience and revised actuarial data; however, several factors could adversely affect our underwriting results. Some of these factors are beyond management's control and could adversely affect its ability to accurately predict and effectively control claims incurred. Examples of such factors include changes in health practices, economic conditions, change in utilization trends including those caused by epidemic conditions, healthcare costs, the advent of natural disasters, and malpractice litigation. Costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe recognize claim liabilities as follows:\nManaged Care Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the managed care segment amounted to $367.0 million and represented 33.1% of our total consolidated claim liabilities and 16.6% of our total consolidated liabilities.\nClaim liabilities are determined employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by managed care actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice, which require that the claim liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. The segment determines the amount of the liability by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project a best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical claims incurred dates are compared to actual dates of claims payment. This information is analyzed to create completion\u201d or development\u201d factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the total expected claims incurred. The majority of unpaid claims, both reported and unreported, for any period, are those claims which are incurred in the final months of the period. Since the percentage of claims paid during the period with respect to claims incurred in those months is generally very low, the above-described completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. In order to complement the analysis to determine the unpaid claims, historical completion factors and payment patterns are applied to incurred and paid claims for the most recent twelve months and compared to the prior twelve month period. Incurred claims for the most recent twelve months also take into account recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels (trend factors). Using all of the above methodologies, our actuaries determine based on the different circumstances the unpaid claims as of the end of period.\n \nBecause the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed.\nManaged care claim liabilities also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is an estimate for known environmental factors that are reasonably likely to affect the required level of reserves. This provision for adverse deviation is intended to capture the potential adverse development from known environmental factors such as our entry into new geographical markets, changes in our geographic or product mix, the introduction of new customer populations, variation in benefit utilization, disease outbreaks, changes in provider reimbursement, fluctuations in medical cost trend, variation in claim submission patterns and variation in claims processing speed and payment patterns, changes in technology that provide faster access to claims data or change the speed of adjudication and settlement of claims, variability in claim inventory levels, non-standard claim development, and/or exceptional situations that require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims.\nCircumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in enrollment, utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, regulatory and legislative requirements, claim processing patterns, and claim submission patterns. A comparison or prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated, but rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. Changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. The re-estimates or recasts are done monthly for the previous four calendar quarters. On average, about 92% of the claims are paid within three months after the last day of the month in which they were incurred and about 5% are within the next three months, for a total of 97% paid within six months after the last day of the month in which they were incurred.\nManagement regularly reviews its assumptions regarding claim liabilities and makes adjustments to claims incurred when necessary. If management's assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our consolidated statement of earnings and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Changes to prior year estimates may result in an increase in claims incurred or a reduction of claims incurred in the period the change is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities are made in each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior year development of claim liabilities is recognized immediately upon the actuary's judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. Health care trends are monitored in conjunction with the claim reserve analysis. Based on these analyses, rating trends are adjusted to anticipate future changes in health care cost or utilization. Thus, the managed care segment incorporates those trends as part of the development of premium rates in an effort to keep premium rating trends in line with claims trends.\n \nAs described above, completion factors and claims trend factors can have a significant impact on determination of our claim liabilities. The following example provides the estimated impact on our December 31, 2017 claim liabilities, assuming the indicated hypothetical changes in completion and trend factors:\n\n (1) Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent twelve months. \n (2) Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent twelve months. \nThe segments' reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate as the ultimate liability for claims within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Management believes that the methodology for determining the best estimate for claim liabilities at each reporting date has been consistently applied.\nAmounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year-end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or run-out becomes known. This information is compared to the originally established year-end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred claims related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The reverse is true of reserve shortfalls. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a short tail\u201d, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately 93%, of any redundancy or shortfall relates to claims incurred in the previous calendar year-end, with the remaining 7% related to claims incurred prior to the previous calendar year-end. Management has not noted any significant emerging trends in claim frequency and severity and the normal fluctuations in enrollment and utilization trends from year to year.\n \nThe following table shows the variance between the segment's incurred claims for current period insured events and the incurred claims for such years had they been determined retrospectively (the Incurred claims related to current period insured events\u201d for the year shown plus or minus the Incurred claims related to prior period insured events\u201d for the following year as included in Note 10, Claim Liabilities and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). This table shows that the segments' estimates of this liability have approximated the actual development.\n\n (1) Includes total claims incurred less adjustments for prior year reserve development. \nManagement expects that substantially all of the development of the 2017 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2018.\nIn the event this segment experiences an unexpected increase in health care cost or utilization trends, we have the following options to cover claim payments:\n \u00b7 Through the management of our cash flows and investment portfolio. \n \u00b7 In the Commercial business we have the ability to increase the premium rates throughout the year in the monthly renewal process, when renegotiating the premiums for the following contract year of each group as they become due. We consider the actual claims trend of each group when determining the premium rates for the following contract year. \n \u00b7 We have available short-term borrowing facilities that from time to time address differences between cash receipts and disbursements. \nFor additional information on our credit facilities, see section Financing and Financing Capacity\u201d of this Item.\nLife Insurance Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the life insurance segment amounted to $45.5 million and represented 4.1% of total consolidated claim liabilities and 2.1% of our total consolidated liabilities.\nThe claim liabilities related to the life insurance segment are based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP. The estimate of claim liabilities for this segment is based on the amount of benefits contractually determined for reported claims, and on estimates based on past experience modified for current trends, for unreported claims. This estimate relies on observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events.\nClaim reserve reviews are generally conducted on a monthly basis, in light of continually updated information. We review reserves using current inventory of policies and claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods, judgments and analysis.\nThe key assumption with regard to claim liabilities for our life insurance segment is related to claims incurred prior to the end of the year, but not yet reported to our subsidiary. A liability for these claims is estimated based upon experience with regards to amounts reported subsequent to the close of business in prior years. There are uncertainties in the development of these estimates; however, in recent years our estimates have resulted in immaterial redundancies or deficiencies.\n \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, claim liabilities for the property and casualty insurance segment amounted to $694.4 million and represented 62.7% of the total consolidated claim liabilities and 31.5% of our total consolidated liabilities. Claims liabilities related to losses caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria amount to approximately $605 million.\nEstimates of the ultimate cost of claims and loss-adjustment expenses of this segment are based largely on the assumption that past developments, with appropriate adjustments due to known or unexpected changes, are a reasonable basis on which to predict future events and trends, and involve a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze current experience, trends and other relevant factors. Property and casualty insurance claim liabilities are categorized and tracked by line of business. Medical malpractice policies are written on a claims-made basis. Policies written on a claims-made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period. Other lines of business are written on an occurrence basis. Hurricane losses include the use of models from industry recognized firms having data, historical and current information about the events, to estimate ultimate losses. These estimates are supplemented by internal estimates of other costs deemed necessary to develop the ultimate losses.\nIndividual case estimates for reported claims are established by a claims adjuster and are changed as new information becomes available during the course of handling the claim. Our property and casualty business, other than medical malpractice, is primarily short-tailed business, where losses (e.g. paid losses and case reserves) are generally reported quickly.\nClaim reserve reviews are generally conducted on a quarterly basis, in light of continually updated information. Our actuary certifies reserves for both current and prior accident years using current claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods, judgments, and analysis. For each line of business, a variety of actuarial methods are used, with the final selections of ultimate losses that are appropriate for each line of business selected based on the current circumstances affecting that line of business. These selections incorporate input from management, particularly from the claims, underwriting and operations divisions, about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.\nKey assumptions are based on the consideration that past emergence of paid losses and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of future emergence and ultimate losses. A key assumption is the expected loss ratio for the current accident year. This expected loss ratio is generally determined through a review of the loss ratios of prior accident years and expected changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year. Another key assumption is the development patterns for paid and reported losses (also referred to as the loss emergence and settlement patterns). The reserves for unreported claims for each year are determined after reviewing the indications produced by each actuarial projection method, which, in turn, rely on the expected paid and reported development patterns and the expected loss ratio for that year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the actuarial reserve range determined by the actuaries was from $638 million to $760 million. Excluding Hurricanes losses, the range is $84 million to $99 million. Management reviews the results of the reserve estimates in order to determine any appropriate adjustments in the recording of reserves. Adjustments to reserve estimates are made after management's consideration of numerous factors, including but not limited to the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business. In general, changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Varying the net expected loss ratio by +/-1% in all lines of business for the six most recent accident years would increase/decrease the claims incurred by approximately $5.4 million.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nOur life insurance segment establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet its policy obligations when a policy matures or surrenders, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events. We compute the amounts for actuarial liabilities in conformity with GAAP.\n \nLiabilities for future policy benefits for whole life and term insurance products and active life reserves for accident and health products are computed by the net level premium method, using interest assumptions ranging from 3.90% to 5.75% and withdrawal, mortality, morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions appropriate at the time the policies were issued (or when a block of business was purchased, as applicable). Accident and health unpaid claim reserves are stated at amounts determined by estimates on individual claims and estimates of unreported claims based on past experience. Deferred annuity reserves are carried at the account value.\nFor deferred annuities, the liability for future policy benefits is equal to total policy account values. The liabilities for all other products are based upon a variety of actuarial assumptions that are uncertain. The most significant of these assumptions is the level of anticipated death and health claims. Other assumptions that are less significant to the appropriate level of the liability for future policy benefits are anticipated policy persistency rates, investment yields, and operating expense levels. These are reviewed frequently by our subsidiary's external actuaries, to assure that the current level of liabilities for future policy benefits is sufficient, in combination with anticipated future cash flows, to provide for all contractual obligations. For all products, except for deferred annuities, the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time of issuance of each contract and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits. We do not currently expect that level of deterioration to occur.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nCertain costs for acquiring life and property and casualty insurance business are deferred. Acquisition costs related to the managed care business are expensed as incurred.\nThe costs of acquiring new life business, principally commissions, and certain variable underwriting and policy issue expenses of our life insurance segment, have been deferred. These costs, including value of business acquired ( VOBA\u201d) recorded upon our acquisitions of TSV and TSB, are amortized to income over the premium-paying period of the related whole life and term insurance policies in proportion to the ratio of the expected annual premium revenue to the expected total premium revenue, and over the anticipated lives of universal life policies in proportion to the ratio of the expected annual gross profits to the expected total gross profits. The expected premiums revenue and gross profits are based upon the same mortality and withdrawal assumptions used in determining the liability for future policy benefits. For universal life and deferred annuity policies, changes in the amount or timing of expected gross profits result in adjustments to the cumulative amortization of these costs. The effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of revisions to estimated gross profits is reported in earnings in the period such estimated gross profits are revised.\nThe schedules of amortization of life insurance deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) and VOBA are based upon actuarial assumptions regarding future events that are uncertain. For all products, other than universal life and deferred annuities, the most significant of these assumptions is the level of contract persistency and investment yield rates. For these products the basis for the amortization of DPAC and VOBA is established at the issue of each contract and would only change if our segment's experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the net liability is not adequate. We do not currently expect that level of deterioration to occur. For the universal life and deferred annuity products, amortization schedules are based upon the level of historic and anticipated gross profit margins, from the date of each contract's issued (or purchase, in the case of VOBA). These schedules are based upon several actuarial assumptions that are uncertain, are reviewed annually and are modified if necessary. The most significant of these assumptions are claims, investment yield rates and contract persistency. Based upon the most recent actuarial reviews of all of the assumptions, we do not currently anticipate material changes to the level of these amortization schedules.\nThe property and casualty business acquisition costs consist of commissions net of reinsurance commissions, during the production of business are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the policies. The method used in calculating deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to actual costs or their estimated realizable value, whichever is lower.\n \nImpairment of Investments\nImpairment of an investment exists if a decline in the estimated fair value is below the amortized cost of the security. Management regularly monitors and evaluates the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of investments. For investments with a fair value below cost, the process includes evaluating: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities, or cost for equity securities, (2) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions, (3) the Company's intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale prior to recovery, (4) the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities, or cost for equity securities, and (5) other factors, as applicable. This process is not exact and further requires consideration of risks such as credit and interest rate risks. Consequently, if an investment's cost exceeds its estimated fair value solely due to changes in interest rates, other-than temporary impairment may not be appropriate. Due to the subjective nature of our analysis, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that we could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if we had access to additional information about the investee. Additionally, it is possible that the investee's ability to meet future contractual obligations may be different than what we determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. If after monitoring and analyzing impaired securities, management determines that a decline in the estimated fair value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security below cost is other than temporary, the carrying amount of the security is reduced to its fair value according to current accounting guidance. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. For debt securities, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis may be accreted into net investment income in future periods based on prospective changes in cash flow estimates, to reflect adjustments to the effective yield.\nManagement reviews investment portfolios under our impairment review policy. Given current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. Management from time to time may sell investments as part of its asset/liability management process or to reposition its investment portfolio based on current and expected market conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment amounting to $49 thousands on equity securities classified as available for sale. The impairment analysis indicated that, none of the securities whose carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value was considered other-than-temporarily impaired as of that date; however, several factors are beyond management's control, such as the following: financial condition of the issuers, movement of interest rates, specific situations within corporations, among others. Over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the estimated fair value of certain securities, which could change management's judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses related to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income.\nOur fixed maturity securities are sensitive to interest rate and credit risk fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Our equity securities are sensitive to equity price risks, for which potential losses could arise from adverse changes in the value of equity securities.

Management Corporation (TSM) and its subsidiaries. TSM operates in three segments: managed care, life insurance, and property & casualty insurance. \n\n- In 2017, consolidated revenues were $2.9 billion, down 2.4% from 2016. This was mainly due to lower managed care and property & casualty premiums. Net income was $54.5 million, up from $17.4 million in 2016, largely due to improvements in the managed care segment. \n\n- Managed care membership declined in 2017, driven by decreases in Medicaid and commercial lines. Claims incurred decreased due to lower membership, operational improvements, and reduced utilization from hurricanes. The managed care medical loss ratio improved from 88.6% to 85.6%.\n\n- Life insurance operating income decreased due to higher commissions and expansion costs. Property & casualty operating income declined due to $14.8 million in estimated hurricane losses. \n\n- The company has $1.1 billion in claim liabilities at year-end 2017, with the majority in property & casualty related to hurricane losses. Critical accounting estimates around claims liabilities are discussed.\n\n- Liquidity remains stable with cash from operations of $286 million. The company repurchased $20 million in stock in 2017. Regulatory capital levels remain above required minimums.\n\nIn summary, TSM showed improved earnings in 2017 led by the managed care segment, but continues to face challenges from hurricane losses, Medicaid membership declines, and ongoing uncertainties in Puerto Rico."}
