Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nMGE Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company operating through subsidiaries in five business segments:\n\u00b7\nRegulated electric utility operations, conducted through MGE,\n\u00b7\nRegulated gas utility operations, conducted through MGE,\n\u00b7\nNonregulated energy operations, conducted through MGE Power and its subsidiaries,\n\u00b7\nTransmission investments, representing our equity investment in ATC and ATC Holdco, and\n\u00b7\nAll other, which includes corporate operations and services.\nOur principal subsidiary is MGE, which generates and distributes electric energy, distributes natural gas, and represents a majority portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. MGE generates and distributes electricity to approximately 153,000 customers in Dane County, Wisconsin, including the city of Madison, and purchases and distributes natural gas to approximately 161,000 customers in the Wisconsin counties of Columbia, Crawford, Dane, Iowa, Juneau, Monroe, and Vernon.\nOur nonregulated energy operations own interests in electric generating capacity that is leased to MGE. The ownership/leasing structure was adopted under applicable state regulatory guidelines for MGE's participation in these generation facilities, consisting principally of a stable return on the equity investment in the new generation facilities over the term of the related leases. The nonregulated energy operations include an ownership interest in two coal-fired generating units in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and a partial ownership of a cogeneration project on the UW-Madison campus. A third party operates the units in Oak Creek, and MGE operates the cogeneration project. Due to the nature of MGE's participation in these facilities, the results of our nonregulated operations are also consolidated into MGE's consolidated financial position and results of operations under applicable accounting standards.\nExecutive Overview\nOur primary focus today and for the foreseeable future is our core utility customers at MGE as well as creating long-term value for our shareholders. MGE continues to face the challenge of providing its customers with reliable power at competitive prices. MGE meets this challenge by investing in more efficient generation projects, including renewable energy sources. MGE continues to examine and pursue opportunities to reduce the proportion that coal generation represents in its generation mix, including the reduction in its ownership of Columbia and its growing ownership of renewable generation sources. MGE will continue to focus on growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs. MGE maintains safe and efficient operations in addition to providing customer value. We believe it is critical to maintain a strong credit standing consistent with financial strength in MGE as well as the parent company in order to accomplish these goals.\nWe earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services, including electric power generation and electric power and gas distribution. The earnings and cash flows from the utility business are sensitive to various external factors, including:\n\u00b7\nWeather, and its impact on customer sales,\n\u00b7\nEconomic conditions, including current business activity and employment and their impact on customer demand,\n\u00b7\nRegulation and regulatory issues, and their impact on the timing and recovery of costs,\n\u00b7\nEnergy commodity prices, including natural gas prices,\n\u00b7\nEquity price risk pertaining to pension related assets,\n\u00b7\nCredit market conditions, including interest rates and our debt credit rating,\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental laws and regulations, including adopted and pending environmental rule changes, and\n\u00b7\nOther factors listed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, MGE Energy's earnings were $84.2 million or $2.43 per share compared to $97.6 million or $2.82 per share for the same period in the prior year. MGE's earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $56.5 million compared to $49.8 million for the same period in the prior year.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>26\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMGE Energy's net income was derived from our business segments as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Business Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Electric Utility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Gas Utility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Nonregulated Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Transmission Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> All Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net income during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:\nElectric Utility\nFor 2018, electric operating income increased primarily as a result of more favorable weather conditions in the current year. Cooling degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the cooling season) increased by 37.2% compared to 2017.\nGas Utility\nFor 2018, gas operating income increased primarily related to an increase in gas retail sales reflecting higher customer demand resulting from colder weather experienced compared to the same period in the prior year and an increase in retail customers. Heating degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the heating season) increased by 11.2% compared to 2017.\nNonregulated Energy\nNonregulated Energy income decreased due to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of lower federal income tax rates associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See \"Tax Reform\" below for additional information.\nOur net income during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:\nElectric and Gas Utility\nElectric and gas net income increased primarily related to a $1.5 million (pre-tax) gain on sale of property assets in 2017, customer growth, and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016.\nNonregulated Energy\nNonregulated Energy income increased due to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of lower federal income tax rates associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See \"Tax Reform\" below for additional information.\nAll Others\nThe decrease in all other income in 2017 primarily results from a $2 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation.\nDuring 2018, the following events occurred:\nTax Reform: On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.\nCustomer rates approved for 2018 reflect an income tax rate of 35 percent. In January 2018, the PSCW issued an order directing Wisconsin investor-owned utilities to defer the over-collection of income tax expense as a result of the decrease in tax rate to 21 percent. The PSCW issued an order in May 2018 to return to customers the estimated 2018 over-collection of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018, MGE returned $8.2 million to customers through bill credits. Any over/under recovery of the actual costs will be subject to the PSCW's review in a future rate case. As of December 31, 2018, MGE has deferred $3.1 million as a regulatory liability and recorded a corresponding reduction in operating revenues for over-collection of income tax expense (net of customer bill credits).\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>27\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSaratoga Wind Farm: In December 2017, the PSCW authorized construction of a 66 MW wind farm, consisting of 33 turbines, located near Saratoga, Iowa. MGE received specific approval to recover 100% AFUDC on the project. As of December 31, 2018, MGE has incurred $95.8 million of capital expenditures. After tax, MGE has recognized $2.5 million in AFUDC equity related to this project for the year ended December 31, 2018. Construction of the project is expected to be completed in February 2019 for approximately $112 million.\nForward Wind: In April 2018, MGE, along with two other utilities, purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center, which consists of 86 wind turbines located in Wisconsin with a total capacity of 137.85 MW. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $174 million, of which MGE's proportionate share is 12.8%, or approximately $23 million. The purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center replaced an existing purchase power agreement, under which MGE purchased 12.8% of the facility's energy output.\nColumbia: MGE and WPL have negotiated an amendment to the existing Columbia joint operating agreement, effective January 1, 2017, under which MGE has reduced its obligation to pay certain capital expenditures (other than SCR-related expenditures) at Columbia in exchange for a proportional reduction in MGE's ownership in Columbia. On January 1 of each year from 2017 through 2019 and then on June 1, 2020, the ownership percentage is adjusted through a partial sale based on the amount of capital expenditures foregone. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MGE classified $3.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively, of Columbia assets as held-for-sale on the consolidated balance sheets. In January 2018, MGE reduced its ownership interest in Columbia from 20.4% to 19.4% as a result of the partial sale of plant assets to WPL.\nDeferred Fuel Costs - Subject to Refund: As of December 31, 2018, MGE has deferred $9.5 million of 2018 fuel savings. These costs will be subject to the PSCW's annual review of 2018 fuel costs, expected to be completed in 2019.\nDebt Issuance: MGE issued $40 million of long-term unsecured debt in July 2018 and $60 million of long-term unsecured debt in September 2018. The proceeds of these debt financings were used to assist with the financing of additional capital expenditures, such as the Saratoga Wind Farm, and refinanced $20 million of long-term debt which matured in September 2018. The covenants of these debt issues are substantially consistent with MGE's existing unsecured long-term debt.\n2017 Annual Fuel Proceeding: In August 2018, the PSCW issued a final decision in the fuel rules proceedings for MGE to refund $4.2 million of additional fuel savings realized during 2017 to its retail electric customers which was returned over a one-month period in October 2018. There was no change to the refund in the fuel rules proceedings from the amount MGE deferred as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring 2019, several items may affect us, including:\n2019/2020 Rate Change Settlement: In December 2018, the PSCW approved the settlement agreement between MGE and intervening parties in the rate case. The settlement decreases electric rates by 2.24% or $9.2 million in 2019. MGE will maintain this rate level for 2020, with the exception that MGE will file a 2020 Fuel Cost Plan in 2019 and MGE's electric rates will be adjusted accordingly. The decrease reflects the ongoing tax impacts of the Tax Act and the addition of lower-cost renewable generation capacity. The settlement agreement increases gas rates by 1.06% or $1.7 million in 2019 and 1.46% or $2.4 million in 2020. The increase covers infrastructure costs. It also reflects the impacts of the Tax Act.\nTax Reform: Pursuant to the Tax Act, deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, were remeasured to reflect the decrease in corporate tax rate. A $130.5 million regulatory liability was recorded given that changes in income taxes are generally passed through in customer rates for the regulated utility. The amount and timing of the cash impacts will depend on the period over which certain income tax benefits are provided to customers, which will be determined by the PSCW. A portion of the regulatory liability will be returned to customers using a normalization method of accounting.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs: Costs for pension and other postretirement benefits are affected by actual investment returns on the assets held for those benefits and by the discount rate, which is sensitive to interest rates, used to calculate those benefits. Volatility in interest rates and investment returns could affect the value of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. These changes may affect benefit costs in future years. As a result of lower investment returns in the fourth quarter of 2018, pension and postretirement benefit costs will increase in 2019. In December 2018, MGE filed a deferral request with the PSCW to defer the difference between estimated pension and other postretirement costs included in the 2019 and 2020 rate settlement and actual expense incurred. If approved, MGE expects to defer approximately $5.9 million in 2019 as a regulatory asset. The pension and other postretirement costs for 2020 are currently unknown. Any overcollection or undercollection of actual expense in 2020 will be netted with the\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>28\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\namount deferred in 2019. MGE expects that the deferred cost for employee benefit plans will be factored into future rate actions starting in 2021. A PSCW decision is expected in early 2019.\nATC Return on Equity: Several parties have filed complaints with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC. Any change to ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future. We derived approximately 7.3% of our net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, from our investment in ATC. See \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC.\nEnvironmental Initiatives: There are proposed legislative rules and initiatives involving matters related to air emissions, water effluent, hazardous materials, and greenhouse gases, all of which affect generation plant capital expenditures and operating costs as well as future operational planning. At present, it is unclear how the changes in the Presidential, Congressional, and EPA administrations may affect existing, pending or new legislative or rulemaking proposals or regulatory initiatives. Such legislation and rulemaking could significantly affect the costs of owning and operating fossil-fueled generating plants, such as Columbia and the Elm Road Units, from which we derive approximately 43% of our electric generating capacity as of December 31, 2018. We would expect to seek and receive recovery of any such costs in rates; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of such costs due to the uncertainty as to the timing and form of the legislation and rules, and the scope and time of the recovery of costs in rates, which may lag the incurrence of those costs.\nEPA's Clean Power Plan: In October 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule with an effective date of December 2015, setting guidelines and approval criteria for states to use in developing plans to control GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and systems. Implementation of the rule is currently stayed by order to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, if implemented, the CPP is expected to have a direct impact on existing coal and natural gas fired generating units, including possible changes in dispatch and additional operating costs. The rule is the subject of pending legal challenges. In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule which would replace the CPP, if successfully implemented. The proposed ACE as it is currently written has the potential to impact Blount, Columbia, and the Elm Road Units. Given the pending CPP legal proceedings and the proposed ACE rule, the nature and timing of any final requirements to control GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs is subject to uncertainty. MGE is unable to determine with any certainty the impact of the CPP and proposed ACE rule on our operations. If an ACE rule is implemented substantially in the form of the CPP rule, it is expected to have a material impact on MGE. MGE will continue to monitor developments with the proposed ACE rule, the CPP rule, and related litigation.\nColumbia: MGE will reduce its obligation to pay certain capital expenditures (other than SCR-related expenditures) at Columbia in exchange for a proportional reduction in MGE's ownership in Columbia. In January 2019, MGE reduced its ownership interest in Columbia from 19.4% to 19.1% as a result of the partial sale of plant assets to WPL. By June 2020, MGE's ownership in Columbia is forecasted to be approximately 19%, a decrease of 3% from the 22% ownership interest held by MGE on January 1, 2016.\nFuture Generation - Riverside: In 2016, MGE entered into an agreement with WPL under which MGE may acquire up to 50 MW of capacity in a gas-fired generating plant to be constructed by WPL at its Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin, during the five-year period following the in-service date of the plant. The plant is expected to be completed by early 2020.\nFuture Generation - Utility Solar: In May 2018, MGE and WPSC filed a joint application with the PSCW for the approval to acquire 300 MW of solar generating capacity from two separate solar projects in Wisconsin, Badger Hollow Solar Farm and Two Creeks Solar Farm. MGE's combined ownership share of the two projects is expected to be 100 MW. If approved by the PSCW, construction of the projects is expected to begin in 2019. MGE's share of the construction cost is expected to be approximately $130 million.\nThe following discussion is based on the business segments as discussed in Footnote 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations include financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and electric and gas margins, both which are non-GAAP measures. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchase power costs) and gas margin (gas revenues less cost of gas sold) are non-GAAP measures because they exclude nonregulated operating revenues used in the calculation of the most comparable GAAP measure, operating income;\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>29\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nother operations and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other general taxes expense and thus are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes that electric and gas margins provide a meaningful basis for evaluating and managing utility operations since fuel for electric generation, purchase power costs, and cost of gas sold are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments. The presentation of utility electric and gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. These electric and gas margins may not be comparable to how other entities calculate utility electric and gas margin or similar measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018, Versus the Year

MGE's fuel-related costs subject to refund decreased revenue $5.3 million. MGE returned $4.2 million and $6.2 million of electric fuel-related savings in October 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MGE has deferred $9.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of fuel-related savings. Under fuel rules, MGE is required to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a 2% cost tolerance band around the amount used in the most recent rate proceeding. Beginning in 2018, over-collection of fuel-related costs outside the tolerance band are reflected as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred. Under-collection of costs outside the tolerance band is reflected as a reduction of purchase power expense in the period incurred. Any potential recovery of excess fuel costs will be recorded in the period received. Prior to adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, effective January 1, 2018, deferred fuel-related costs were reflected in purchased power expense, with potential refunds associated with fuel savings increasing that expense and potential recovery of excess fuel costs decreasing that expense.\no\nTransmission. MGE's transmission costs subject to refund decreased revenue $2.2 million primarily related to a one-time refund received in June 2018.\no\nOperating Costs. MGE's electric plant operating costs subject to refund decreased revenue $4.1 million primarily related to lower leased generation costs due to the reduction in tax rate.\n\u00b7\nOther. During 2018, other items affecting electric operating revenues decreased $1.8 million primarily attributable to a decrease in demand charges as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state.\n\u00b7\nVolume. During 2018, there was an 8.4% increase in residential electric sales volumes compared to the same period in the prior year driven by favorable weather conditions. During 2018, there was a 8.4% decrease in industrial retail electric sales volumes compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state.\n\u00b7\nFuel Costs. Fuel costs decreased during 2018, primarily as a result of a reduction in purchased power. The purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center in April 2018 replaced an existing purchase power agreement that was previously recorded as purchased power expense in fuel costs.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>31\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas deliveries and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's gas revenues and gas therms delivered by customer class during each of the years indicated:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except HDD and average rate per therm of retail customer)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Therms Delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial/Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gas transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,767\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Heating degree days (normal 6,913)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average rate per therm of retail customer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.736\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas margin, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.6 million during 2018 compared to 2017, due to the following:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase in volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue subject to refund/tax credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u00b7\nVolume. For 2018, retail gas deliveries increased 11.8% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to customer growth and more favorable weather conditions in the current year.\n\u00b7\nRevenue subject to refund/tax credit. MGE received a PSCW order in January 2018 to defer the over-collection of income tax expense collected in customer rates as a result of the Tax Act reduction in federal income tax rate to 21 percent. Any over-collection of the difference between actual costs incurred and the amount of costs collected from customers is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred. For 2018, MGE recorded a $1.5 million reduction in retail gas revenues and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability. During 2018, MGE returned $1.9 million to gas customers through bill credits related to the tax credit.\nConsolidated operations and maintenance expenses\nFor 2018, operations and maintenance expenses increased $0.1 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The following contributed to the net change:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased customer accounts costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased gas distribution costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased electric distribution costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased other costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased electric transmission costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2018, decreased electric transmission costs are primarily related to a decrease in transmission rates as a result of a one-time refund received in June 2018. The lower transmission rate is reflected in customer revenue as revenue subject to refund.\nConsolidated depreciation expense\nElectric depreciation expense increased $2.3 million and gas depreciation expense increased $1.0 million for 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in depreciable assets and change in estimated useful lives of capitalized software assets affected by the technology corporate initiative.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>32\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2018 and 2017, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $20.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively. The decrease in net income is attributable to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. The decrease in tax rate lowered lease revenues and income tax expense in 2018. Income tax expense is a factor used in the formula to calculate lease rates. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nTransmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nFor 2018 and 2017, other income at the transmission investment segment was $8.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The decrease in tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, lowered earnings from ATC and income tax expense for 2018. Income tax expense is a factor used in the calculation of ATC's transmission rates. The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of the investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016. In the near term, it is expected that ATC Holdco will be pursuing transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.\nConsolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE\nAlthough effective tax rates have been lowered as a result of the Tax Act, regulated revenues have been affected as tax expense is a factor in the determination of rates for electric and gas service, and rates relating to our investment in transmission. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details of effective income tax rates for continuing operations.\nNoncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE\nThe noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs.

During 2017, customers received a fuel credit on their bill related to accumulated fuel savings of $6.2 million, which decreased electric revenues. During 2016, customers received a fuel credit on their bill related to the fuel savings of $23.7 million, which decreased electric revenues in the prior year. In January 2016, the PSCW lowered MGE's 2016 fuel rules monitored costs as a result of continued lower projected fuel costs in 2016.\n\u00b7\nAdjustments to Revenue. MGE leases electric generating capacity from MGE Power Elm Road. MGE collects in rates the lease payments associated with the electric generating capacity as authorized by the PSCW. Any differential between estimated lease payments collected in rates and actual lease payments paid to MGE Power Elm Road are included in adjustments to revenues.\n\u00b7\nVolume. During 2017, there was a 15.6% decrease in industrial retail sales volumes compared to the same period in 2016 as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state. During 2017, there was a 4.3% decrease in residential sales volumes compared to the same period in 2016 driven by decreased customer demand due, at least in part, to less favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by the lower number of cooling degree days.\n\u00b7\nRate Changes. In December 2016, the PSCW authorized MGE to decrease 2017 rates for retail electric customers by 0.8% or $3.3 million on an annual basis.\nRates charged to retail customers for 2017, were 2.2% or $4.0 million lower than those charged during the same period in 2016.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>34\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u00b7\nSales to the Market. Sales to the market represent wholesale sales made to third parties who are not ultimate users of the electricity. These sales may include spot market transactions on the markets operated by MISO and PJM. These sales may also include bilateral sales to other utilities or power marketers. Generating units are dispatched by MISO based on cost considerations as well as reliability of the system. Sales to the market typically occur when MGE has more generation and purchases online than are needed for its own system demand. The excess electricity is then sold to others in the market. For 2017, market volumes decreased compared to the same period in 2016, reflecting decreased opportunities for sales, and those sales were made at lower market prices. The revenue generated from these sales is included in fuel rules monitored costs. See fuel rules discussion in Footnote 8.b. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nElectric fuel and purchased power\nElectric fuel and purchased power costs reflect a decrease in internal generation volumes partially offset by an increase in the volume of purchased power when compared to 2016. Adjustments related to the regulatory recovery for fuel costs, known as fuel rules, increased purchased power expense. These items are explained below.\nFuel for electric generation\nThe expense for fuel for internal electric generation decreased $7.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the following:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decrease in volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decrease in per-unit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis decrease in expense reflects an 8.1% decrease in internal generation volume delivered to the system primarily as a result of decreased generation at WCCF based on market prices and a 5.0% decrease in per-unit cost of internal electric generation.\nPurchased power\nPurchased power expense increased $2.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the following:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase in volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decrease in per-unit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in fuel rule adjustments, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in expense (before fuel rules adjustments) reflects a 4.9% increase in the volume of power purchased from third parties, partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in the per-unit cost of purchased power.\nUnder fuel rules, MGE is required to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a 2% cost tolerance band around the amount used in the most recent rate proceeding. Any fuel rules adjustments are reflected in purchased power expense, with potential refunds associated with fuel savings increasing that expense and potential recovery of excess fuel costs decreasing that expense.\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses increased $3.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The following changes contributed to the net change:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased transmission costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased customer accounts costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased other costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased production costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased administrative and general costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>35\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, increased transmission costs are primarily due to an increase in transmission reliability enhancements and increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to technology improvements, partially offset by decreased production costs at Columbia and the Elm Road Units.\nElectric depreciation expense\nElectric depreciation expense increased $7.5 million during 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of new depreciation rates for Columbia, as approved by the PSCW.\nOther electric income\nOther electric income increased $1.0 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of property assets.\nGas Utility Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nGas deliveries and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's gas revenues and gas therms delivered by customer class during each of the years indicated:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except HDD and average rate per therm of retail customer)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Therms Delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,695\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial/Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gas transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,825\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Heating degree days (normal 6,916)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average rate per therm of retail customer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.773\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas revenues increased $14.3 million or 10.6% during 2017.

In December 2016, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2017 rates for retail gas customers by 1.9% or $3.1 million on an annual basis.\nMGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the purchased gas adjustment clause (PGA). Under the PGA, MGE is able to pass through to its gas customers the cost of gas. Changes in PGA recoveries affect revenues but do not impact net income.\nThe average retail rate per therm for 2017 increased 6.5% compared to 2016, reflecting a $6.5 million increase in natural gas commodity costs (recovered through the PGA). Additionally, there was an increase in fixed rate charges.\n\u00b7\nVolume. For 2017, retail gas deliveries increased 4.3% compared to 2016. The increase in volume is primarily related to customer growth and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016.\nCost of gas sold\nFor 2017, cost of gas sold increased by $9.9 million, compared to 2016. The cost per therm of natural gas increased 9.2%, which resulted in $6.5 million of increased expense. The volume of gas purchased increased 5.1%, which resulted in $3.4 million of increased expense.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td>36\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas operating and maintenance expenses\nGas operating and maintenance expenses increased $1.6 million for 2017 compared to 2016.

Increased customer service costs are due to higher Focus on Energy payments. Focus on Energy is Wisconsin's statewide energy efficiency and renewable resource program to promote energy efficiency on customer's premises. Decreased administrative and general costs are primarily related to a decrease in payroll expense.\nNonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2017 and 2016, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $40.5 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The increase in net income is attributable to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nTransmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nFor 2017 and 2016, other income at the transmission investment segment was $9.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of the investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016. In the near term, it is expected that ATC Holdco will be pursuing transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.\nAll Other Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nOther income\nThe decrease in all other income primarily results from a $2 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation.\nConsolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE\nMGE Energy's effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 18.5% and 36.0%, respectively. MGE's effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 17.0% and 35.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for both MGE Energy and MGE in 2017 was primarily related to the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Tax Act, deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, were remeasured to reflect the decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details of effective income tax rates for continuing operations.\nNoncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE\nThe noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Also included in noncontrolling interest, net of tax, for 2016 is MGE Energy's interest in MGE Transco, which holds our investment in ATC.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>37\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows MGE Energy's noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflected on MGE's consolidated statement of income:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Power Elm Road(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Power West Campus(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Transco(b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)\nIn 2017, there was a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\n(b)\nMGE Transco holds an ownership interest in ATC. In July 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco declined below a majority, resulting in MGE Energy's investment in MGE Transco being deconsolidated from MGE's consolidated financial statements. See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of noncontrolling interest. In December 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco was transferred to MGE Energy. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMGE Energy and MGE have adequate liquidity to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Available resources include cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, liquid assets, borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities, and access to equity and debt capital markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes cash flows for MGE Energy and MGE during 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MGE Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cash provided by/(used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,040\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,373\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,994\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,120\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218,328)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116,275)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,813)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,302)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,572)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,635)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,637)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,112)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,897)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,845)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nMGE Energy\nMGE Energy's consolidated net cash provided by operating activities is derived mainly from the electric and gas operations of its principal subsidiary, MGE.\n2018 vs. 2017\nCash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $153.0 million, an increase of $21.7 million when compared to the prior year.\nMGE Energy's net income decreased $13.4 million for 2018 when compared to the prior year primarily related to a $21.6 million one-time 2017 noncash tax impact of the Tax Act from the nonregulated energy segment.\nMGE Energy's federal and state taxes paid decreased $14.6 million during 2018, when compared to the prior year, reflecting the reduction in tax rates effected by the Tax Act.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $10.5 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, primarily due to increased current liabilities, decreased unbilled revenues, and decreased inventories, partially offset by decreased accounts payable and increased receivables.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $12.7 million in cash used for operating activities for 2017, primarily due to decreased accounts payable, increased receivables, increased inventories, and increased unbilled revenues, partially offset by increased current liabilities.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>38\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA decrease in pension contribution resulted in an additional $5.7 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, when compared to the prior year.

This project accounts for $95.8 million of the capital expenditures for 2018.\nMGE Energy used funds received as dividend payments from MGE Power West Campus and MGE Power Elm Road, internally generated cash, and long-term and short-term external financing to meet its 2018 capital requirements and cash obligations, including dividend payments. External financing included short-term financing under existing lines of credit.\nThe forecasted capital expenditures are based upon management's assumptions with respect to future events, including the timing and amount of expenditures associated with compliance with environmental compliance initiatives, load growth, and the timing and adequacy of rate recovery. Actual events may differ materially from those assumptions and result in material changes to those forecasted amounts.\nIn May 2018, MGE and WPSC filed a joint application with the PSCW for the approval to acquire 300 MW of solar generating capacity from two separate solar projects in Wisconsin, Badger Hollow Solar Farm and Two Creeks Solar Farm. MGE's combined ownership share of the two projects is expected to be 100 MW. If approved by the PSCW, construction of the projects is expected to begin in 2019. MGE's share of the construction cost is expected to be approximately $130 million. The application is pending approval by the PSCW and is excluded from the forecasted capital expenditures noted above.\nFinancing Activities\nMGE Energy\n2018 vs. 2017\nCash provided by MGE Energy's financing activities was $38.1 million for 2018, compared to $4.6 million of cash used for 2017.\nFor 2018, cash dividends paid were $45.8 million compared to $43.7 million in the prior year.

The PSCW order restricts any dividends, above the PSCW authorized amount of $70.8 million, that MGE may pay MGE Energy if its common equity ratio, calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding, is less than 55%. MGE's thirteen month rolling average common equity ratio as of December 31, 2018, is 56.3%, as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding. This restriction did not impact MGE's payment of dividends in 2018. Cash dividends of $45.0 million were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2017. No cash dividends were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2018.

The \"floating rate\" is calculated on a daily basis as the highest of a prime rate, a Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum, or a Eurodollar Rate for a one-month interest period plus 1%. The \"floating rate\" adder ranges from zero to 0.125%. The \"Eurodollar Rate\" is calculated as provided in the Credit Agreements. The \"Eurodollar Rate\" adder ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%.\nThe credit agreements require the borrower to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization not to exceed a maximum of 65%. The ratio calculation excludes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in MGE's financial statements as a result of the consolidation of VIEs, such as MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. As of December 31, 2018, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization for each of MGE Energy and MGE, as calculated under the credit agreements' covenant, were 38.5% and 43.0%, respectively.

At the time, MISO's base ROE was 12.38% and ATC's base ROE was 12.2%. In February 2015, a second complaint was filed for the period February 2015 through May 2015 with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to the filing date of the complaint. In June 2016, an administrative law judge issued an initial decision for the second complaint that would reduce the transmission owner's base ROE to 9.7%. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. It is anticipated FERC will issue an order on this issue in 2019. On September 28, 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint, for the period November 2013 through February 2015, reducing the base ROE to 10.32%. This base ROE also became effective September 28, 2016, and will apply to future periods until FERC rules in the second complaint, at which time the base ROE ordered by FERC in the second complaint will prospectively become the authorized base ROE. Any change to ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future.\nIn January 2015, FERC accepted the transmission owner's request for a 50 basis-point incentive ROE adder for participating in MISO. The adder became effective January 6, 2015.\nOur share of ATC's earnings reflects a pre-tax adjustment of $0.5 million and $1.9 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, recorded by ATC for these matters representing its estimate of its refund liability. There was not a pre-tax expense for 2018. We derived approximately 7.3%, 6.2%, and 6.8% of our net income for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, from our investment in ATC.\nCritical Accounting Estimates - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to unbilled revenues, allowance for doubtful accounts, pension obligations, income taxes, derivatives, and regulatory assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Those values may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>45\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnbilled Revenues\nRevenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are recorded when electricity/gas is delivered to those customers. The quantity of those sales is measured by customers' meters. Due to the large volume of those meters, it is impractical to read all of them at month end. Meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter-reading schedules. Consequently, at the end of any month, there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings. As a result, management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter-read dates and the end of the period. These estimates include:\n\u00b7\nThe amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers (line loss) and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers.\n\u00b7\nThe amount of gas expected to be lost in the process of its distribution to customers and the amount of gas actually delivered to customers.\n\u00b7\nThe mix of sales between customer rate classes, which is based upon historical utilization assumptions.\nMGE monitors the reasonableness of the unbilled revenue estimate through the review of ratios such as unbilled electric consumption compared to billed electric sales. In the case of unbilled gas, the estimated unbilled consumption is compared to various other statistics, including percent of gas available for sale, change in unbilled month to month and change in unbilled compared to the prior year in order to confirm its reasonableness.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nMGE maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. It determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, regional economic data, and review of the accounts receivable aging. MGE reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Although management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is MGE's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses, if the financial condition of MGE's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nMGE provides employees with certain retirement (pension) and postretirement (health care and life insurance) benefits. In order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, the rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, health care trends, mortality rates, and other factors. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure. Different estimates used by us could result in recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Recovery in rates is expected.\nMGE uses third-party specialists to assist us in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on available investment yields and the historical performance of our plan assets. They are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management's judgment and can materially affect net income.\n\u00b7\nAssumed return on assets. This assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested (or to be invested) to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. For 2018, MGE used an assumed return on assets of 7.40% for pension and 6.94% for other postretirement benefits. In 2019, the pension asset assumption will decrease to 7.20% and the postretirement benefit assumption will decrease to 6.72%. The annual expected rate of return is based on projected long-term equity and bond returns, maturities and asset allocations. Holding other assumptions constant, for every 1% reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets, annual pension and other postretirement cost would increase by approximately $4.0 million, before taxes.\n\u00b7\nDiscount rate. The discount rate represents the rate at which pension obligations could effectively be settled on a present-value basis. MGE uses high-grade bond yields as a benchmark for determining the appropriate discount rate. MGE uses individual spot rates, instead of a weighted average of the yield curve spot rates, for measuring the service cost and interest cost components for net periodic benefit cost. Holding other assumptions constant, a 0.5%\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>46\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nreduction in the discount rate on the obligation balance as of December 31, 2018, would increase annual pension and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.6 million, before taxes.\n\u00b7\nMedical trend assumptions. The health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per-capita health care charges.\n\u00b7\nMortality rate assumption. Expected mortality rates are used in the valuation to determine the expected duration of future benefit payments to the plan participants. MGE utilizes mortality tables and projection scales developed by a third-party actuary that were updated in 2018.\nSee Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional discussion of these plans.\nIncome Tax Provision\nMGE Energy's and MGE's income tax provisions, including both current and deferred components, are based on estimates, assumptions, calculations, and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years. Determination of current-year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years.\nManagement regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final.\nAdditionally, in determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recorded for those benefits that do not meet this criterion. We record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. The passing of the law significantly lowers MGE's corporate tax rates and triggered a remeasurement of deferred taxes. We reflected estimates of the impact of the Tax Act in our year-end 2017 financial results. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, any subsequent adjustment to these amounts would be recorded in 2018 when the analysis is complete. No material adjustments have been recorded during 2018. Furthermore, while regulation allows us to incorporate changes in tax law into the rate-setting process, there will likely be timing delays before realization of the changes.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all tax positions and requires a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. The threshold is defined for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as \"more likely than not\" that the position is sustainable, based on its merits. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nMGE accounts for derivative financial instruments, except those qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale exception, at their fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value is determined using current quoted market prices, except for the PPA, which is valued utilizing an internally-developed pricing model. This model includes observable and unobservable inputs.\nMGE received approval from the PSCW to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark-to-market accounting on contracts related to commodity hedging in MGE's regulated operations.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>47\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulatory Assets/Liabilities\nRegulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates. MGE bases its assessment of recovery on precedents established by the regulatory body. Regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities typically include deferral of energy costs, the normalization of income taxes, the deferral of certain operating expenses, and non-ARO removal costs. The accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with regulatory accounting standards.\nMGE continually assesses whether the regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current-period revenues or expenses.\nAmortization of regulatory assets and liabilities is provided over the recovery or deferral period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement.\nAdoption of Accounting Principles and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - MGE Energy and MGE\nSee Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for discussion of new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nMGE Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company operating through subsidiaries in five business segments:\n\u00b7\nRegulated electric utility operations, conducted through MGE,\n\u00b7\nRegulated gas utility operations, conducted through MGE,\n\u00b7\nNonregulated energy operations, conducted through MGE Power and its subsidiaries,\n\u00b7\nTransmission investments, representing our equity investment in ATC and ATC Holdco, and\n\u00b7\nAll other, which includes corporate operations and services.\nOur principal subsidiary is MGE, which generates and distributes electric energy, distributes natural gas, and represents a majority portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. MGE generates and distributes electricity to approximately 153,000 customers in Dane County, Wisconsin, including the city of Madison, and purchases and distributes natural gas to approximately 161,000 customers in the Wisconsin counties of Columbia, Crawford, Dane, Iowa, Juneau, Monroe, and Vernon.\nOur nonregulated energy operations own interests in electric generating capacity that is leased to MGE. The ownership/leasing structure was adopted under applicable state regulatory guidelines for MGE's participation in these generation facilities, consisting principally of a stable return on the equity investment in the new generation facilities over the term of the related leases. The nonregulated energy operations include an ownership interest in two coal-fired generating units in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and a partial ownership of a cogeneration project on the UW-Madison campus. A third party operates the units in Oak Creek, and MGE operates the cogeneration project. Due to the nature of MGE's participation in these facilities, the results of our nonregulated operations are also consolidated into MGE's consolidated financial position and results of operations under applicable accounting standards.\nExecutive Overview\nOur primary focus today and for the foreseeable future is our core utility customers at MGE as well as creating long-term value for our shareholders. MGE continues to face the challenge of providing its customers with reliable power at competitive prices. MGE meets this challenge by investing in more efficient generation projects, including renewable energy sources. MGE continues to examine and pursue opportunities to reduce the proportion that coal generation represents in its generation mix, including the reduction in its ownership of Columbia and its growing ownership of renewable generation sources. MGE will continue to focus on growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs. MGE maintains safe and efficient operations in addition to providing customer value. We believe it is critical to maintain a strong credit standing consistent with financial strength in MGE as well as the parent company in order to accomplish these goals.\nWe earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services, including electric power generation and electric power and gas distribution. The earnings and cash flows from the utility business are sensitive to various external factors, including:\n\u00b7\nWeather, and its impact on customer sales,\n\u00b7\nEconomic conditions, including current business activity and employment and their impact on customer demand,\n\u00b7\nRegulation and regulatory issues, and their impact on the timing and recovery of costs,\n\u00b7\nEnergy commodity prices, including natural gas prices,\n\u00b7\nEquity price risk pertaining to pension related assets,\n\u00b7\nCredit market conditions, including interest rates and our debt credit rating,\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental laws and regulations, including adopted and pending environmental rule changes, and\n\u00b7\nOther factors listed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, MGE Energy's earnings were $84.2 million or $2.43 per share compared to $97.6 million or $2.82 per share for the same period in the prior year. MGE's earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $56.5 million compared to $49.8 million for the same period in the prior year.\n 26 \n \nMGE Energy's net income was derived from our business segments as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Business Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Electric Utility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Gas Utility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Nonregulated Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Transmission Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> All Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net income during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:\nElectric Utility\nFor 2018, electric operating income increased primarily as a result of more favorable weather conditions in the current year. Cooling degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the cooling season) increased by 37.2% compared to 2017.\nGas Utility\nFor 2018, gas operating income increased primarily related to an increase in gas retail sales reflecting higher customer demand resulting from colder weather experienced compared to the same period in the prior year and an increase in retail customers. Heating degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the heating season) increased by 11.2% compared to 2017.\nNonregulated Energy\nNonregulated Energy income decreased due to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of lower federal income tax rates associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See \"Tax Reform\" below for additional information.\nOur net income during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:\nElectric and Gas Utility\nElectric and gas net income increased primarily related to a $1.5 million (pre-tax) gain on sale of property assets in 2017, customer growth, and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016.\nNonregulated Energy\nNonregulated Energy income increased due to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of lower federal income tax rates associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See \"Tax Reform\" below for additional information.\nAll Others\nThe decrease in all other income in 2017 primarily results from a $2 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation.\nDuring 2018, the following events occurred:\nTax Reform: On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.\nCustomer rates approved for 2018 reflect an income tax rate of 35 percent. In January 2018, the PSCW issued an order directing Wisconsin investor-owned utilities to defer the over-collection of income tax expense as a result of the decrease in tax rate to 21 percent. The PSCW issued an order in May 2018 to return to customers the estimated 2018 over-collection of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018, MGE returned $8.2 million to customers through bill credits. Any over/under recovery of the actual costs will be subject to the PSCW's review in a future rate case. As of December 31, 2018, MGE has deferred $3.1 million as a regulatory liability and recorded a corresponding reduction in operating revenues for over-collection of income tax expense (net of customer bill credits).\n 27 \n \nSaratoga Wind Farm: In December 2017, the PSCW authorized construction of a 66 MW wind farm, consisting of 33 turbines, located near Saratoga, Iowa. MGE received specific approval to recover 100% AFUDC on the project. As of December 31, 2018, MGE has incurred $95.8 million of capital expenditures. After tax, MGE has recognized $2.5 million in AFUDC equity related to this project for the year ended December 31, 2018. Construction of the project is expected to be completed in February 2019 for approximately $112 million.\nForward Wind: In April 2018, MGE, along with two other utilities, purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center, which consists of 86 wind turbines located in Wisconsin with a total capacity of 137.85 MW. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $174 million, of which MGE's proportionate share is 12.8%, or approximately $23 million. The purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center replaced an existing purchase power agreement, under which MGE purchased 12.8% of the facility's energy output.\nColumbia: MGE and WPL have negotiated an amendment to the existing Columbia joint operating agreement, effective January 1, 2017, under which MGE has reduced its obligation to pay certain capital expenditures (other than SCR-related expenditures) at Columbia in exchange for a proportional reduction in MGE's ownership in Columbia. On January 1 of each year from 2017 through 2019 and then on June 1, 2020, the ownership percentage is adjusted through a partial sale based on the amount of capital expenditures foregone. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MGE classified $3.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively, of Columbia assets as held-for-sale on the consolidated balance sheets. In January 2018, MGE reduced its ownership interest in Columbia from 20.4% to 19.4% as a result of the partial sale of plant assets to WPL.\nDeferred Fuel Costs - Subject to Refund: As of December 31, 2018, MGE has deferred $9.5 million of 2018 fuel savings. These costs will be subject to the PSCW's annual review of 2018 fuel costs, expected to be completed in 2019.\nDebt Issuance: MGE issued $40 million of long-term unsecured debt in July 2018 and $60 million of long-term unsecured debt in September 2018. The proceeds of these debt financings were used to assist with the financing of additional capital expenditures, such as the Saratoga Wind Farm, and refinanced $20 million of long-term debt which matured in September 2018. The covenants of these debt issues are substantially consistent with MGE's existing unsecured long-term debt.\n2017 Annual Fuel Proceeding: In August 2018, the PSCW issued a final decision in the fuel rules proceedings for MGE to refund $4.2 million of additional fuel savings realized during 2017 to its retail electric customers which was returned over a one-month period in October 2018. There was no change to the refund in the fuel rules proceedings from the amount MGE deferred as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring 2019, several items may affect us, including:\n2019/2020 Rate Change Settlement: In December 2018, the PSCW approved the settlement agreement between MGE and intervening parties in the rate case. The settlement decreases electric rates by 2.24% or $9.2 million in 2019. MGE will maintain this rate level for 2020, with the exception that MGE will file a 2020 Fuel Cost Plan in 2019 and MGE's electric rates will be adjusted accordingly. The decrease reflects the ongoing tax impacts of the Tax Act and the addition of lower-cost renewable generation capacity. The settlement agreement increases gas rates by 1.06% or $1.7 million in 2019 and 1.46% or $2.4 million in 2020. The increase covers infrastructure costs. It also reflects the impacts of the Tax Act.\nTax Reform: Pursuant to the Tax Act, deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, were remeasured to reflect the decrease in corporate tax rate. A $130.5 million regulatory liability was recorded given that changes in income taxes are generally passed through in customer rates for the regulated utility. The amount and timing of the cash impacts will depend on the period over which certain income tax benefits are provided to customers, which will be determined by the PSCW. A portion of the regulatory liability will be returned to customers using a normalization method of accounting.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs: Costs for pension and other postretirement benefits are affected by actual investment returns on the assets held for those benefits and by the discount rate, which is sensitive to interest rates, used to calculate those benefits. Volatility in interest rates and investment returns could affect the value of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. These changes may affect benefit costs in future years. As a result of lower investment returns in the fourth quarter of 2018, pension and postretirement benefit costs will increase in 2019. In December 2018, MGE filed a deferral request with the PSCW to defer the difference between estimated pension and other postretirement costs included in the 2019 and 2020 rate settlement and actual expense incurred. If approved, MGE expects to defer approximately $5.9 million in 2019 as a regulatory asset. The pension and other postretirement costs for 2020 are currently unknown. Any overcollection or undercollection of actual expense in 2020 will be netted with the\n 28 \n \namount deferred in 2019. MGE expects that the deferred cost for employee benefit plans will be factored into future rate actions starting in 2021. A PSCW decision is expected in early 2019.\nATC Return on Equity: Several parties have filed complaints with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC. Any change to ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future. We derived approximately 7.3% of our net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, from our investment in ATC. See \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC.\nEnvironmental Initiatives: There are proposed legislative rules and initiatives involving matters related to air emissions, water effluent, hazardous materials, and greenhouse gases, all of which affect generation plant capital expenditures and operating costs as well as future operational planning. At present, it is unclear how the changes in the Presidential, Congressional, and EPA administrations may affect existing, pending or new legislative or rulemaking proposals or regulatory initiatives. Such legislation and rulemaking could significantly affect the costs of owning and operating fossil-fueled generating plants, such as Columbia and the Elm Road Units, from which we derive approximately 43% of our electric generating capacity as of December 31, 2018. We would expect to seek and receive recovery of any such costs in rates; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of such costs due to the uncertainty as to the timing and form of the legislation and rules, and the scope and time of the recovery of costs in rates, which may lag the incurrence of those costs.\nEPA's Clean Power Plan: In October 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule with an effective date of December 2015, setting guidelines and approval criteria for states to use in developing plans to control GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and systems. Implementation of the rule is currently stayed by order to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, if implemented, the CPP is expected to have a direct impact on existing coal and natural gas fired generating units, including possible changes in dispatch and additional operating costs. The rule is the subject of pending legal challenges. In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule which would replace the CPP, if successfully implemented. The proposed ACE as it is currently written has the potential to impact Blount, Columbia, and the Elm Road Units. Given the pending CPP legal proceedings and the proposed ACE rule, the nature and timing of any final requirements to control GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs is subject to uncertainty. MGE is unable to determine with any certainty the impact of the CPP and proposed ACE rule on our operations. If an ACE rule is implemented substantially in the form of the CPP rule, it is expected to have a material impact on MGE. MGE will continue to monitor developments with the proposed ACE rule, the CPP rule, and related litigation.\nColumbia: MGE will reduce its obligation to pay certain capital expenditures (other than SCR-related expenditures) at Columbia in exchange for a proportional reduction in MGE's ownership in Columbia. In January 2019, MGE reduced its ownership interest in Columbia from 19.4% to 19.1% as a result of the partial sale of plant assets to WPL. By June 2020, MGE's ownership in Columbia is forecasted to be approximately 19%, a decrease of 3% from the 22% ownership interest held by MGE on January 1, 2016.\nFuture Generation - Riverside: In 2016, MGE entered into an agreement with WPL under which MGE may acquire up to 50 MW of capacity in a gas-fired generating plant to be constructed by WPL at its Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin, during the five-year period following the in-service date of the plant. The plant is expected to be completed by early 2020.\nFuture Generation - Utility Solar: In May 2018, MGE and WPSC filed a joint application with the PSCW for the approval to acquire 300 MW of solar generating capacity from two separate solar projects in Wisconsin, Badger Hollow Solar Farm and Two Creeks Solar Farm. MGE's combined ownership share of the two projects is expected to be 100 MW. If approved by the PSCW, construction of the projects is expected to begin in 2019. MGE's share of the construction cost is expected to be approximately $130 million.\nThe following discussion is based on the business segments as discussed in Footnote 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations include financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and electric and gas margins, both which are non-GAAP measures. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchase power costs) and gas margin (gas revenues less cost of gas sold) are non-GAAP measures because they exclude nonregulated operating revenues used in the calculation of the most comparable GAAP measure, operating income;\n 29 \n \nother operations and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other general taxes expense and thus are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes that electric and gas margins provide a meaningful basis for evaluating and managing utility operations since fuel for electric generation, purchase power costs, and cost of gas sold are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments. The presentation of utility electric and gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. These electric and gas margins may not be comparable to how other entities calculate utility electric and gas margin or similar measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table provides a calculation of electric and gas margins (non-GAAP), along with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, operating income:\nTable

For cost recovery mechanisms, any over-collection of the difference between actual costs incurred and the amount of costs collected from customers is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred.\no\nTax Act. MGE received a PSCW order in January 2018 to defer the over-collection of income tax expense collected in customer rates as a result of the Tax Act reduction in federal income tax rate to 21 percent. During 2018, MGE recorded a $4.4 million reduction in retail electric revenues and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability. During 2018, MGE returned $6.3 million to electric customers through bill credits related to the tax credit.\no\nFuel-related costs. MGE's fuel-related costs subject to refund decreased revenue $5.3 million. MGE returned $4.2 million and $6.2 million of electric fuel-related savings in October 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MGE has deferred $9.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of fuel-related savings. Under fuel rules, MGE is required to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a 2% cost tolerance band around the amount used in the most recent rate proceeding. Beginning in 2018, over-collection of fuel-related costs outside the tolerance band are reflected as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred. Under-collection of costs outside the tolerance band is reflected as a reduction of purchase power expense in the period incurred. Any potential recovery of excess fuel costs will be recorded in the period received. Prior to adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, effective January 1, 2018, deferred fuel-related costs were reflected in purchased power expense, with potential refunds associated with fuel savings increasing that expense and potential recovery of excess fuel costs decreasing that expense.\no\nTransmission. MGE's transmission costs subject to refund decreased revenue $2.2 million primarily related to a one-time refund received in June 2018.\no\nOperating Costs. MGE's electric plant operating costs subject to refund decreased revenue $4.1 million primarily related to lower leased generation costs due to the reduction in tax rate.\n\u00b7\nOther. During 2018, other items affecting electric operating revenues decreased $1.8 million primarily attributable to a decrease in demand charges as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state.\n\u00b7\nVolume. During 2018, there was an 8.4% increase in residential electric sales volumes compared to the same period in the prior year driven by favorable weather conditions. During 2018, there was a 8.4% decrease in industrial retail electric sales volumes compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state.\n\u00b7\nFuel Costs. Fuel costs decreased during 2018, primarily as a result of a reduction in purchased power. The purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center in April 2018 replaced an existing purchase power agreement that was previously recorded as purchased power expense in fuel costs.\n 31 \n \nGas deliveries and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's gas revenues and gas therms delivered by customer class during each of the years indicated:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except HDD and average rate per therm of retail customer)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Therms Delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial/Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gas transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,767\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Heating degree days (normal 6,913)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average rate per therm of retail customer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.736\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas margin, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.6 million during 2018 compared to 2017, due to the following:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase in volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue subject to refund/tax credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u00b7\nVolume. For 2018, retail gas deliveries increased 11.8% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to customer growth and more favorable weather conditions in the current year.\n\u00b7\nRevenue subject to refund/tax credit. MGE received a PSCW order in January 2018 to defer the over-collection of income tax expense collected in customer rates as a result of the Tax Act reduction in federal income tax rate to 21 percent. Any over-collection of the difference between actual costs incurred and the amount of costs collected from customers is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred. For 2018, MGE recorded a $1.5 million reduction in retail gas revenues and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability. During 2018, MGE returned $1.9 million to gas customers through bill credits related to the tax credit.\nConsolidated operations and maintenance expenses\nFor 2018, operations and maintenance expenses increased $0.1 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The following contributed to the net change:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased customer accounts costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased gas distribution costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased electric distribution costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased other costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased electric transmission costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2018, decreased electric transmission costs are primarily related to a decrease in transmission rates as a result of a one-time refund received in June 2018. The lower transmission rate is reflected in customer revenue as revenue subject to refund.\nConsolidated depreciation expense\nElectric depreciation expense increased $2.3 million and gas depreciation expense increased $1.0 million for 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in depreciable assets and change in estimated useful lives of capitalized software assets affected by the technology corporate initiative.\n 32 \n \nNonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2018 and 2017, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $20.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively. The decrease in net income is attributable to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. The decrease in tax rate lowered lease revenues and income tax expense in 2018. Income tax expense is a factor used in the formula to calculate lease rates. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nTransmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nFor 2018 and 2017, other income at the transmission investment segment was $8.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The decrease in tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, lowered earnings from ATC and income tax expense for 2018. Income tax expense is a factor used in the calculation of ATC's transmission rates. The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of the investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016. In the near term, it is expected that ATC Holdco will be pursuing transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.\nConsolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE\nAlthough effective tax rates have been lowered as a result of the Tax Act, regulated revenues have been affected as tax expense is a factor in the determination of rates for electric and gas service, and rates relating to our investment in transmission. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details of effective income tax rates for continuing operations.\nNoncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE\nThe noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The following table shows MGE Energy's noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflected on MGE's consolidated statement of income:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Power Elm Road(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Power West Campus(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)\nIn 2017, there was a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act.

During 2017, customers received a fuel credit on their bill related to accumulated fuel savings of $6.2 million, which decreased electric revenues. During 2016, customers received a fuel credit on their bill related to the fuel savings of $23.7 million, which decreased electric revenues in the prior year. In January 2016, the PSCW lowered MGE's 2016 fuel rules monitored costs as a result of continued lower projected fuel costs in 2016.\n\u00b7\nAdjustments to Revenue. MGE leases electric generating capacity from MGE Power Elm Road. MGE collects in rates the lease payments associated with the electric generating capacity as authorized by the PSCW. Any differential between estimated lease payments collected in rates and actual lease payments paid to MGE Power Elm Road are included in adjustments to revenues.\n\u00b7\nVolume. During 2017, there was a 15.6% decrease in industrial retail sales volumes compared to the same period in 2016 as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state. During 2017, there was a 4.3% decrease in residential sales volumes compared to the same period in 2016 driven by decreased customer demand due, at least in part, to less favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by the lower number of cooling degree days.\n\u00b7\nRate Changes. In December 2016, the PSCW authorized MGE to decrease 2017 rates for retail electric customers by 0.8% or $3.3 million on an annual basis.\nRates charged to retail customers for 2017, were 2.2% or $4.0 million lower than those charged during the same period in 2016.\n 34 \n \n\u00b7\nSales to the Market. Sales to the market represent wholesale sales made to third parties who are not ultimate users of the electricity. These sales may include spot market transactions on the markets operated by MISO and PJM. These sales may also include bilateral sales to other utilities or power marketers. Generating units are dispatched by MISO based on cost considerations as well as reliability of the system. Sales to the market typically occur when MGE has more generation and purchases online than are needed for its own system demand. The excess electricity is then sold to others in the market. For 2017, market volumes decreased compared to the same period in 2016, reflecting decreased opportunities for sales, and those sales were made at lower market prices. The revenue generated from these sales is included in fuel rules monitored costs. See fuel rules discussion in Footnote 8.b. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nElectric fuel and purchased power\nElectric fuel and purchased power costs reflect a decrease in internal generation volumes partially offset by an increase in the volume of purchased power when compared to 2016. Adjustments related to the regulatory recovery for fuel costs, known as fuel rules, increased purchased power expense. These items are explained below.\nFuel for electric generation\nThe expense for fuel for internal electric generation decreased $7.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the following:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decrease in volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decrease in per-unit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis decrease in expense reflects an 8.1% decrease in internal generation volume delivered to the system primarily as a result of decreased generation at WCCF based on market prices and a 5.0% decrease in per-unit cost of internal electric generation.\nPurchased power\nPurchased power expense increased $2.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the following:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase in volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decrease in per-unit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in fuel rule adjustments, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in expense (before fuel rules adjustments) reflects a 4.9% increase in the volume of power purchased from third parties, partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in the per-unit cost of purchased power.\nUnder fuel rules, MGE is required to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a 2% cost tolerance band around the amount used in the most recent rate proceeding. Any fuel rules adjustments are reflected in purchased power expense, with potential refunds associated with fuel savings increasing that expense and potential recovery of excess fuel costs decreasing that expense.\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses increased $3.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The following changes contributed to the net change:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased transmission costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased customer accounts costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased other costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased production costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased administrative and general costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 35 \n \nFor 2017, increased transmission costs are primarily due to an increase in transmission reliability enhancements and increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to technology improvements, partially offset by decreased production costs at Columbia and the Elm Road Units.\nElectric depreciation expense\nElectric depreciation expense increased $7.5 million during 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of new depreciation rates for Columbia, as approved by the PSCW.\nOther electric income\nOther electric income increased $1.0 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of property assets.\nGas Utility Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nGas deliveries and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's gas revenues and gas therms delivered by customer class during each of the years indicated:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except HDD and average rate per therm of retail customer)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Therms Delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,695\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial/Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gas transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,825\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Heating degree days (normal 6,916)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average rate per therm of retail customer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.773\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas revenues increased $14.3 million or 10.6% during 2017.

In December 2016, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2017 rates for retail gas customers by 1.9% or $3.1 million on an annual basis.\nMGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the purchased gas adjustment clause (PGA). Under the PGA, MGE is able to pass through to its gas customers the cost of gas. Changes in PGA recoveries affect revenues but do not impact net income.\nThe average retail rate per therm for 2017 increased 6.5% compared to 2016, reflecting a $6.5 million increase in natural gas commodity costs (recovered through the PGA). Additionally, there was an increase in fixed rate charges.\n\u00b7\nVolume. For 2017, retail gas deliveries increased 4.3% compared to 2016. The increase in volume is primarily related to customer growth and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016.\nCost of gas sold\nFor 2017, cost of gas sold increased by $9.9 million, compared to 2016. The cost per therm of natural gas increased 9.2%, which resulted in $6.5 million of increased expense. The volume of gas purchased increased 5.1%, which resulted in $3.4 million of increased expense.\n 36 \n \nGas operating and maintenance expenses\nGas operating and maintenance expenses increased $1.6 million for 2017 compared to 2016. The following changes contributed to the net change:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased customer accounts costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased customer service costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increased other costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Decreased administrative and general costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to technology improvements. Increased customer service costs are due to higher Focus on Energy payments. Focus on Energy is Wisconsin's statewide energy efficiency and renewable resource program to promote energy efficiency on customer's premises. Decreased administrative and general costs are primarily related to a decrease in payroll expense.\nNonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2017 and 2016, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $40.5 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The increase in net income is attributable to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nTransmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nFor 2017 and 2016, other income at the transmission investment segment was $9.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of the investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016. In the near term, it is expected that ATC Holdco will be pursuing transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.\nAll Other Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nOther income\nThe decrease in all other income primarily results from a $2 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation.\nConsolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE\nMGE Energy's effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 18.5% and 36.0%, respectively. MGE's effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 17.0% and 35.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for both MGE Energy and MGE in 2017 was primarily related to the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Tax Act, deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, were remeasured to reflect the decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details of effective income tax rates for continuing operations.\nNoncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE\nThe noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Also included in noncontrolling interest, net of tax, for 2016 is MGE Energy's interest in MGE Transco, which holds our investment in ATC.\n 37 \n \nThe following table shows MGE Energy's noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflected on MGE's consolidated statement of income:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Power Elm Road(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Power West Campus(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Transco(b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)\nIn 2017, there was a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\n(b)\nMGE Transco holds an ownership interest in ATC. In July 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco declined below a majority, resulting in MGE Energy's investment in MGE Transco being deconsolidated from MGE's consolidated financial statements. See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of noncontrolling interest. In December 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco was transferred to MGE Energy. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMGE Energy and MGE have adequate liquidity to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Available resources include cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, liquid assets, borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities, and access to equity and debt capital markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes cash flows for MGE Energy and MGE during 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MGE Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cash provided by/(used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,040\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,373\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,994\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,120\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218,328)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116,275)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,813)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,302)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,572)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,635)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,637)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,112)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,897)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,845)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nMGE Energy\nMGE Energy's consolidated net cash provided by operating activities is derived mainly from the electric and gas operations of its principal subsidiary, MGE.\n2018 vs. 2017\nCash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $153.0 million, an increase of $21.7 million when compared to the prior year.\nMGE Energy's net income decreased $13.4 million for 2018 when compared to the prior year primarily related to a $21.6 million one-time 2017 noncash tax impact of the Tax Act from the nonregulated energy segment.\nMGE Energy's federal and state taxes paid decreased $14.6 million during 2018, when compared to the prior year, reflecting the reduction in tax rates effected by the Tax Act.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $10.5 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, primarily due to increased current liabilities, decreased unbilled revenues, and decreased inventories, partially offset by decreased accounts payable and increased receivables.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $12.7 million in cash used for operating activities for 2017, primarily due to decreased accounts payable, increased receivables, increased inventories, and increased unbilled revenues, partially offset by increased current liabilities.\n 38 \n \nA decrease in pension contribution resulted in an additional $5.7 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, when compared to the prior year.

See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further details.\nMGE received $1.7 million in proceeds from the sales of property in 2017.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table shows MGE Energy's actual capital expenditures for both 2018 and 2017, forecasted capital expenditures for 2019, and annual average forecasted capital expenditures for the years 2020 through 2022:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Forecasted\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Annual Average)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Electric\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,353\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,399\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,696\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Utility plant total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Nonregulated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> MGE Energy total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,131\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,197\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,833\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Saratoga Wind Farm began construction in 2018. This project accounts for $95.8 million of the capital expenditures for 2018.\nMGE Energy used funds received as dividend payments from MGE Power West Campus and MGE Power Elm Road, internally generated cash, and long-term and short-term external financing to meet its 2018 capital requirements and cash obligations, including dividend payments. External financing included short-term financing under existing lines of credit.\nThe forecasted capital expenditures are based upon management's assumptions with respect to future events, including the timing and amount of expenditures associated with compliance with environmental compliance initiatives, load growth, and the timing and adequacy of rate recovery. Actual events may differ materially from those assumptions and result in material changes to those forecasted amounts.\nIn May 2018, MGE and WPSC filed a joint application with the PSCW for the approval to acquire 300 MW of solar generating capacity from two separate solar projects in Wisconsin, Badger Hollow Solar Farm and Two Creeks Solar Farm. MGE's combined ownership share of the two projects is expected to be 100 MW. If approved by the PSCW, construction of the projects is expected to begin in 2019. MGE's share of the construction cost is expected to be approximately $130 million. The application is pending approval by the PSCW and is excluded from the forecasted capital expenditures noted above.\nFinancing Activities\nMGE Energy\n2018 vs. 2017\nCash provided by MGE Energy's financing activities was $38.1 million for 2018, compared to $4.6 million of cash used for 2017.\nFor 2018, cash dividends paid were $45.8 million compared to $43.7 million in the prior year. This increase was a result of a higher dividend per share ($1.32 vs. $1.26).\n 41 \n \nDuring 2018, MGE issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $20.0 million of maturing long-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures. The increase in long-term debt primarily reflects expenditures on the construction of the Saratoga wind project. During 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2018, net short-term debt borrowings were $9.0 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year.\n2017 vs. 2016\nCash used for MGE Energy's financing activities was $4.6 million for 2017, compared to $46.1 million of cash used for 2016.\nFor 2017, cash dividends paid were $43.7 million compared to $41.8 million in 2016. This increase was a result of a higher dividend per share $1.26 vs. $1.21).\nDuring 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2017, short-term debt borrowings were $4.0 million. There were no short-term borrowings for 2016.\nMGE\n2018 vs. 2017\nDuring 2018, cash provided by MGE's financing activities was $61.9 million, compared to $23.9 million of cash used for MGE's financing activities in the prior year.\nCash dividends paid from MGE to MGE Energy were $45.0 million in the prior year. There were no cash dividends paid from MGE to MGE Energy for 2018.\nDistributions to parent (MGE Energy) from noncontrolling interest, which represent distributions from MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, were $22.0 million for 2018, compared to $18.0 million in the prior year.\nDuring 2018, MGE issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $20.0 million of maturing long-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures. The increase in long-term debt primarily reflects expenditures on the construction of the Saratoga wind project. During 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2018, net short-term debt borrowings were $9.0 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year.\n2017 vs. 2016\nDuring 2017, cash used for MGE's financing activities was $23.9 million, compared to $76.8 million of cash used for MGE's financing activities in 2016.\nCash dividends paid from MGE to MGE Energy were $45.0 million for 2017, compared to $50.0 million in 2016.\nDistributions to parent (MGE Energy) from noncontrolling interest, which represent distributions from MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, were $18.0 million for 2017, compared to $24.1 million in 2016.\nFor 2016, equity contributions received from noncontrolling interest, which represent contributions by MGE Energy to MGE Transco, were $1.6 million. There were no equity contributions received from noncontrolling interest, which represent contributions to MGE Transco for 2017, as MGE Transco was a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGE Energy during 2017.\nDuring 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2017, short-term borrowings were $4.0 million. There were no short-term borrowings for 2016.\n 42 \n \nDividend Restrictions\nDividend payments by MGE to MGE Energy are subject to restrictions arising under a PSCW rate order and, to a lesser degree, MGE's first mortgage bonds. The PSCW order restricts any dividends, above the PSCW authorized amount of $70.8 million, that MGE may pay MGE Energy if its common equity ratio, calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding, is less than 55%. MGE's thirteen month rolling average common equity ratio as of December 31, 2018, is 56.3%, as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding. This restriction did not impact MGE's payment of dividends in 2018. Cash dividends of $45.0 million were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2017. No cash dividends were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2018. The rate proceeding calculation includes as indebtedness imputed amounts for MGE's outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other PSCW adjustments but does not include the indebtedness associated with MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, which are consolidated into MGE's financial statements but are not direct obligations of MGE.\nMGE has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases, after December 31, 1945, shall not exceed the earned surplus (retained earnings) accumulated subsequent to December 31, 1945. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $400.0 million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant.\nCredit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2018, MGE Energy and MGE had the following aggregate bank commitments and available capacity under their credit agreements:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>Borrower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aggregate Bank Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available Capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Date(a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGE Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 1, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 1, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)\nOn February 7, 2019, MGE Energy and MGE amended and restated the credit agreements to extend the initial term expiration date to February 7, 2024.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreements may bear interest at a rate based upon either a \"floating rate\" or a \"Eurodollar Rate\" adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an adder based upon the credit ratings assigned to MGE's senior unsecured long-term debt securities. The \"floating rate\" is calculated on a daily basis as the highest of a prime rate, a Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum, or a Eurodollar Rate for a one-month interest period plus 1%. The \"floating rate\" adder ranges from zero to 0.125%. The \"Eurodollar Rate\" is calculated as provided in the Credit Agreements. The \"Eurodollar Rate\" adder ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%.\nThe credit agreements require the borrower to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization not to exceed a maximum of 65%. The ratio calculation excludes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in MGE's financial statements as a result of the consolidation of VIEs, such as MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. As of December 31, 2018, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization for each of MGE Energy and MGE, as calculated under the credit agreements' covenant, were 38.5% and 43.0%, respectively. See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information regarding the credit facilities.\nCapitalization Ratios\nMGE Energy's capitalization ratios were as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MGE Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Common shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>61.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Long-term debt(a)\n</td> <td>37.5 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>1.0 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)\nIncludes the current portion of long-term debt.\n 43 \n \nCredit Ratings\nMGE Energy's and MGE's access to the capital markets, including, in the case of MGE, the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the credit ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.\nNone of MGE Energy's or MGE's borrowing is subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrading of MGE's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges under both MGE Energy's and MGE's credit agreements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments for MGE Energy and MGE\nMGE Energy's and MGE's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, representing cash obligations that are considered to be firm commitments, are as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due Within:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due After\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGE Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,431\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,553\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,430\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,903\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433,545\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase-to-maturity transactions -

MGE does not expect to need to make any required contributions to the qualified plans for 2019 or 2020. The contributions for years after 2020 are not yet currently estimated. Due to uncertainties in the future economic performance of plan assets, discount rates, and other key assumptions, estimated contributions are subject to change. MGE may also elect to make additional discretionary contributions to the plans.\nThe above amounts do not include future capital calls by ATC and ATC Holdco. In January 2019, MGE Transco made a $0.2 million capital contribution to ATC, and MGEE Transco made a $0.1 million capital contribution to ATC Holdco. The amount and timing of future capital calls to these entities is uncertain and primarily dependent on the operations and expansion of ATC and ATC Holdco.\n 44 \n \nMGE Energy's and MGE's commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018, representing commitments triggered by future events and including financing arrangements to secure obligations of MGE Energy and MGE, are as follows:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Within:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Available lines of credit(a)(c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Available lines of credit(b)(c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)\nAmount includes the facilities discussed in (b) plus an additional line of credit.

At the time, MISO's base ROE was 12.38% and ATC's base ROE was 12.2%. In February 2015, a second complaint was filed for the period February 2015 through May 2015 with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to the filing date of the complaint. In June 2016, an administrative law judge issued an initial decision for the second complaint that would reduce the transmission owner's base ROE to 9.7%. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. It is anticipated FERC will issue an order on this issue in 2019. On September 28, 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint, for the period November 2013 through February 2015, reducing the base ROE to 10.32%. This base ROE also became effective September 28, 2016, and will apply to future periods until FERC rules in the second complaint, at which time the base ROE ordered by FERC in the second complaint will prospectively become the authorized base ROE. Any change to ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future.\nIn January 2015, FERC accepted the transmission owner's request for a 50 basis-point incentive ROE adder for participating in MISO. The adder became effective January 6, 2015.\nOur share of ATC's earnings reflects a pre-tax adjustment of $0.5 million and $1.9 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, recorded by ATC for these matters representing its estimate of its refund liability. There was not a pre-tax expense for 2018. We derived approximately 7.3%, 6.2%, and 6.8% of our net income for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, from our investment in ATC.\nCritical Accounting Estimates - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to unbilled revenues, allowance for doubtful accounts, pension obligations, income taxes, derivatives, and regulatory assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Those values may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n 45 \n \nUnbilled Revenues\nRevenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are recorded when electricity/gas is delivered to those customers. The quantity of those sales is measured by customers' meters. Due to the large volume of those meters, it is impractical to read all of them at month end. Meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter-reading schedules. Consequently, at the end of any month, there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings. As a result, management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter-read dates and the end of the period. These estimates include:\n\u00b7\nThe amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers (line loss) and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers.\n\u00b7\nThe amount of gas expected to be lost in the process of its distribution to customers and the amount of gas actually delivered to customers.\n\u00b7\nThe mix of sales between customer rate classes, which is based upon historical utilization assumptions.\nMGE monitors the reasonableness of the unbilled revenue estimate through the review of ratios such as unbilled electric consumption compared to billed electric sales. In the case of unbilled gas, the estimated unbilled consumption is compared to various other statistics, including percent of gas available for sale, change in unbilled month to month and change in unbilled compared to the prior year in order to confirm its reasonableness.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nMGE maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. It determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, regional economic data, and review of the accounts receivable aging. MGE reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Although management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is MGE's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses, if the financial condition of MGE's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nMGE provides employees with certain retirement (pension) and postretirement (health care and life insurance) benefits. In order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, the rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, health care trends, mortality rates, and other factors. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure. Different estimates used by us could result in recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Recovery in rates is expected.\nMGE uses third-party specialists to assist us in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on available investment yields and the historical performance of our plan assets. They are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management's judgment and can materially affect net income.\n\u00b7\nAssumed return on assets. This assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested (or to be invested) to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. For 2018, MGE used an assumed return on assets of 7.40% for pension and 6.94% for other postretirement benefits. In 2019, the pension asset assumption will decrease to 7.20% and the postretirement benefit assumption will decrease to 6.72%. The annual expected rate of return is based on projected long-term equity and bond returns, maturities and asset allocations. Holding other assumptions constant, for every 1% reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets, annual pension and other postretirement cost would increase by approximately $4.0 million, before taxes.\n\u00b7\nDiscount rate. The discount rate represents the rate at which pension obligations could effectively be settled on a present-value basis. MGE uses high-grade bond yields as a benchmark for determining the appropriate discount rate. MGE uses individual spot rates, instead of a weighted average of the yield curve spot rates, for measuring the service cost and interest cost components for net periodic benefit cost. Holding other assumptions constant, a 0.5%\n 46 \n \nreduction in the discount rate on the obligation balance as of December 31, 2018, would increase annual pension and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.6 million, before taxes.\n\u00b7\nMedical trend assumptions. The health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per-capita health care charges.\n\u00b7\nMortality rate assumption. Expected mortality rates are used in the valuation to determine the expected duration of future benefit payments to the plan participants. MGE utilizes mortality tables and projection scales developed by a third-party actuary that were updated in 2018.\nSee Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional discussion of these plans.\nIncome Tax Provision\nMGE Energy's and MGE's income tax provisions, including both current and deferred components, are based on estimates, assumptions, calculations, and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years. Determination of current-year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years.\nManagement regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final.\nAdditionally, in determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recorded for those benefits that do not meet this criterion. We record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. The passing of the law significantly lowers MGE's corporate tax rates and triggered a remeasurement of deferred taxes. We reflected estimates of the impact of the Tax Act in our year-end 2017 financial results. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, any subsequent adjustment to these amounts would be recorded in 2018 when the analysis is complete. No material adjustments have been recorded during 2018. Furthermore, while regulation allows us to incorporate changes in tax law into the rate-setting process, there will likely be timing delays before realization of the changes.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all tax positions and requires a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. The threshold is defined for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as \"more likely than not\" that the position is sustainable, based on its merits. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nMGE accounts for derivative financial instruments, except those qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale exception, at their fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value is determined using current quoted market prices, except for the PPA, which is valued utilizing an internally-developed pricing model. This model includes observable and unobservable inputs.\nMGE received approval from the PSCW to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark-to-market accounting on contracts related to commodity hedging in MGE's regulated operations.\n 47 \n \nRegulatory Assets/Liabilities\nRegulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates. MGE bases its assessment of recovery on precedents established by the regulatory body. Regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities typically include deferral of energy costs, the normalization of income taxes, the deferral of certain operating expenses, and non-ARO removal costs. The accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with regulatory accounting standards.\nMGE continually assesses whether the regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current-period revenues or expenses.\nAmortization of regulatory assets and liabilities is provided over the recovery or deferral period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement.\nAdoption of Accounting Principles and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - MGE Energy and MGE\nSee Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for discussion of new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nMGE Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company operating through subsidiaries in five business segments:\n\u00b7\nRegulated electric utility operations, conducted through MGE,\n\u00b7\nRegulated gas utility operations, conducted through MGE,\n\u00b7\nNonregulated energy operations, conducted through MGE Power and its subsidiaries,\n\u00b7\nTransmission investments, representing our equity investment in ATC and ATC Holdco, and\n\u00b7\nAll other, which includes corporate operations and services.\nOur principal subsidiary is MGE, which generates and distributes electric energy, distributes natural gas, and represents a majority portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. MGE generates and distributes electricity to approximately 153,000 customers in Dane County, Wisconsin, including the city of Madison, and purchases and distributes natural gas to approximately 161,000 customers in the Wisconsin counties of Columbia, Crawford, Dane, Iowa, Juneau, Monroe, and Vernon.\nOur nonregulated energy operations own interests in electric generating capacity that is leased to MGE. The ownership/leasing structure was adopted under applicable state regulatory guidelines for MGE's participation in these generation facilities, consisting principally of a stable return on the equity investment in the new generation facilities over the term of the related leases. The nonregulated energy operations include an ownership interest in two coal-fired generating units in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and a partial ownership of a cogeneration project on the UW-Madison campus. A third party operates the units in Oak Creek, and MGE operates the cogeneration project. Due to the nature of MGE's participation in these facilities, the results of our nonregulated operations are also consolidated into MGE's consolidated financial position and results of operations under applicable accounting standards.\nExecutive Overview\nOur primary focus today and for the foreseeable future is our core utility customers at MGE as well as creating long-term value for our shareholders. MGE continues to face the challenge of providing its customers with reliable power at competitive prices. MGE meets this challenge by investing in more efficient generation projects, including renewable energy sources. MGE continues to examine and pursue opportunities to reduce the proportion that coal generation represents in its generation mix, including the reduction in its ownership of Columbia and its growing ownership of renewable generation sources. MGE will continue to focus on growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs. MGE maintains safe and efficient operations in addition to providing customer value. We believe it is critical to maintain a strong credit standing consistent with financial strength in MGE as well as the parent company in order to accomplish these goals.\nWe earn our revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services, including electric power generation and electric power and gas distribution. The earnings and cash flows from the utility business are sensitive to various external factors, including:\n\u00b7\nWeather, and its impact on customer sales,\n\u00b7\nEconomic conditions, including current business activity and employment and their impact on customer demand,\n\u00b7\nRegulation and regulatory issues, and their impact on the timing and recovery of costs,\n\u00b7\nEnergy commodity prices, including natural gas prices,\n\u00b7\nEquity price risk pertaining to pension related assets,\n\u00b7\nCredit market conditions, including interest rates and our debt credit rating,\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental laws and regulations, including adopted and pending environmental rule changes, and\n\u00b7\nOther factors listed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, MGE Energy's earnings were $84.2 million or $2.43 per share compared to $97.6 million or $2.82 per share for the same period in the prior year. MGE's earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $56.5 million compared to $49.8 million for the same period in the prior year.\n 26 \n \nMGE Energy's net income was derived from our business segments as follows:\n\nOur net income during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:\nElectric Utility\nFor 2018, electric operating income increased primarily as a result of more favorable weather conditions in the current year. Cooling degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the cooling season) increased by 37.2% compared to 2017.\nGas Utility\nFor 2018, gas operating income increased primarily related to an increase in gas retail sales reflecting higher customer demand resulting from colder weather experienced compared to the same period in the prior year and an increase in retail customers. Heating degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the heating season) increased by 11.2% compared to 2017.\nNonregulated Energy\nNonregulated Energy income decreased due to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of lower federal income tax rates associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See \"Tax Reform\" below for additional information.\nOur net income during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:\nElectric and Gas Utility\nElectric and gas net income increased primarily related to a $1.5 million (pre-tax) gain on sale of property assets in 2017, customer growth, and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016.\nNonregulated Energy\nNonregulated Energy income increased due to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of lower federal income tax rates associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See \"Tax Reform\" below for additional information.\nAll Others\nThe decrease in all other income in 2017 primarily results from a $2 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation.\nDuring 2018, the following events occurred:\nTax Reform: On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.\nCustomer rates approved for 2018 reflect an income tax rate of 35 percent. In January 2018, the PSCW issued an order directing Wisconsin investor-owned utilities to defer the over-collection of income tax expense as a result of the decrease in tax rate to 21 percent. The PSCW issued an order in May 2018 to return to customers the estimated 2018 over-collection of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018, MGE returned $8.2 million to customers through bill credits. Any over/under recovery of the actual costs will be subject to the PSCW's review in a future rate case. As of December 31, 2018, MGE has deferred $3.1 million as a regulatory liability and recorded a corresponding reduction in operating revenues for over-collection of income tax expense (net of customer bill credits).\n 27 \n \nSaratoga Wind Farm: In December 2017, the PSCW authorized construction of a 66 MW wind farm, consisting of 33 turbines, located near Saratoga, Iowa. MGE received specific approval to recover 100% AFUDC on the project. As of December 31, 2018, MGE has incurred $95.8 million of capital expenditures. After tax, MGE has recognized $2.5 million in AFUDC equity related to this project for the year ended December 31, 2018. Construction of the project is expected to be completed in February 2019 for approximately $112 million.\nForward Wind: In April 2018, MGE, along with two other utilities, purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center, which consists of 86 wind turbines located in Wisconsin with a total capacity of 137.85 MW. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $174 million, of which MGE's proportionate share is 12.8%, or approximately $23 million. The purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center replaced an existing purchase power agreement, under which MGE purchased 12.8% of the facility's energy output.\nColumbia: MGE and WPL have negotiated an amendment to the existing Columbia joint operating agreement, effective January 1, 2017, under which MGE has reduced its obligation to pay certain capital expenditures (other than SCR-related expenditures) at Columbia in exchange for a proportional reduction in MGE's ownership in Columbia. On January 1 of each year from 2017 through 2019 and then on June 1, 2020, the ownership percentage is adjusted through a partial sale based on the amount of capital expenditures foregone. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MGE classified $3.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively, of Columbia assets as held-for-sale on the consolidated balance sheets. In January 2018, MGE reduced its ownership interest in Columbia from 20.4% to 19.4% as a result of the partial sale of plant assets to WPL.\nDeferred Fuel Costs - Subject to Refund: As of December 31, 2018, MGE has deferred $9.5 million of 2018 fuel savings. These costs will be subject to the PSCW's annual review of 2018 fuel costs, expected to be completed in 2019.\nDebt Issuance: MGE issued $40 million of long-term unsecured debt in July 2018 and $60 million of long-term unsecured debt in September 2018. The proceeds of these debt financings were used to assist with the financing of additional capital expenditures, such as the Saratoga Wind Farm, and refinanced $20 million of long-term debt which matured in September 2018. The covenants of these debt issues are substantially consistent with MGE's existing unsecured long-term debt.\n2017 Annual Fuel Proceeding: In August 2018, the PSCW issued a final decision in the fuel rules proceedings for MGE to refund $4.2 million of additional fuel savings realized during 2017 to its retail electric customers which was returned over a one-month period in October 2018. There was no change to the refund in the fuel rules proceedings from the amount MGE deferred as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring 2019, several items may affect us, including:\n2019/2020 Rate Change Settlement: In December 2018, the PSCW approved the settlement agreement between MGE and intervening parties in the rate case. The settlement decreases electric rates by 2.24% or $9.2 million in 2019. MGE will maintain this rate level for 2020, with the exception that MGE will file a 2020 Fuel Cost Plan in 2019 and MGE's electric rates will be adjusted accordingly. The decrease reflects the ongoing tax impacts of the Tax Act and the addition of lower-cost renewable generation capacity. The settlement agreement increases gas rates by 1.06% or $1.7 million in 2019 and 1.46% or $2.4 million in 2020. The increase covers infrastructure costs. It also reflects the impacts of the Tax Act.\nTax Reform: Pursuant to the Tax Act, deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, were remeasured to reflect the decrease in corporate tax rate. A $130.5 million regulatory liability was recorded given that changes in income taxes are generally passed through in customer rates for the regulated utility. The amount and timing of the cash impacts will depend on the period over which certain income tax benefits are provided to customers, which will be determined by the PSCW. A portion of the regulatory liability will be returned to customers using a normalization method of accounting.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs: Costs for pension and other postretirement benefits are affected by actual investment returns on the assets held for those benefits and by the discount rate, which is sensitive to interest rates, used to calculate those benefits. Volatility in interest rates and investment returns could affect the value of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. These changes may affect benefit costs in future years. As a result of lower investment returns in the fourth quarter of 2018, pension and postretirement benefit costs will increase in 2019. In December 2018, MGE filed a deferral request with the PSCW to defer the difference between estimated pension and other postretirement costs included in the 2019 and 2020 rate settlement and actual expense incurred. If approved, MGE expects to defer approximately $5.9 million in 2019 as a regulatory asset. The pension and other postretirement costs for 2020 are currently unknown. Any overcollection or undercollection of actual expense in 2020 will be netted with the\n 28 \n \namount deferred in 2019. MGE expects that the deferred cost for employee benefit plans will be factored into future rate actions starting in 2021. A PSCW decision is expected in early 2019.\nATC Return on Equity: Several parties have filed complaints with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC. Any change to ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future. We derived approximately 7.3% of our net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, from our investment in ATC. See \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC.\nEnvironmental Initiatives: There are proposed legislative rules and initiatives involving matters related to air emissions, water effluent, hazardous materials, and greenhouse gases, all of which affect generation plant capital expenditures and operating costs as well as future operational planning. At present, it is unclear how the changes in the Presidential, Congressional, and EPA administrations may affect existing, pending or new legislative or rulemaking proposals or regulatory initiatives. Such legislation and rulemaking could significantly affect the costs of owning and operating fossil-fueled generating plants, such as Columbia and the Elm Road Units, from which we derive approximately 43% of our electric generating capacity as of December 31, 2018. We would expect to seek and receive recovery of any such costs in rates; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of such costs due to the uncertainty as to the timing and form of the legislation and rules, and the scope and time of the recovery of costs in rates, which may lag the incurrence of those costs.\nEPA's Clean Power Plan: In October 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule with an effective date of December 2015, setting guidelines and approval criteria for states to use in developing plans to control GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and systems. Implementation of the rule is currently stayed by order to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, if implemented, the CPP is expected to have a direct impact on existing coal and natural gas fired generating units, including possible changes in dispatch and additional operating costs. The rule is the subject of pending legal challenges. In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule which would replace the CPP, if successfully implemented. The proposed ACE as it is currently written has the potential to impact Blount, Columbia, and the Elm Road Units. Given the pending CPP legal proceedings and the proposed ACE rule, the nature and timing of any final requirements to control GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs is subject to uncertainty. MGE is unable to determine with any certainty the impact of the CPP and proposed ACE rule on our operations. If an ACE rule is implemented substantially in the form of the CPP rule, it is expected to have a material impact on MGE. MGE will continue to monitor developments with the proposed ACE rule, the CPP rule, and related litigation.\nColumbia: MGE will reduce its obligation to pay certain capital expenditures (other than SCR-related expenditures) at Columbia in exchange for a proportional reduction in MGE's ownership in Columbia. In January 2019, MGE reduced its ownership interest in Columbia from 19.4% to 19.1% as a result of the partial sale of plant assets to WPL. By June 2020, MGE's ownership in Columbia is forecasted to be approximately 19%, a decrease of 3% from the 22% ownership interest held by MGE on January 1, 2016.\nFuture Generation - Riverside: In 2016, MGE entered into an agreement with WPL under which MGE may acquire up to 50 MW of capacity in a gas-fired generating plant to be constructed by WPL at its Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin, during the five-year period following the in-service date of the plant. The plant is expected to be completed by early 2020.\nFuture Generation - Utility Solar: In May 2018, MGE and WPSC filed a joint application with the PSCW for the approval to acquire 300 MW of solar generating capacity from two separate solar projects in Wisconsin, Badger Hollow Solar Farm and Two Creeks Solar Farm. MGE's combined ownership share of the two projects is expected to be 100 MW. If approved by the PSCW, construction of the projects is expected to begin in 2019. MGE's share of the construction cost is expected to be approximately $130 million.\nThe following discussion is based on the business segments as discussed in Footnote 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations include financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and electric and gas margins, both which are non-GAAP measures. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchase power costs) and gas margin (gas revenues less cost of gas sold) are non-GAAP measures because they exclude nonregulated operating revenues used in the calculation of the most comparable GAAP measure, operating income;\n 29 \n \nother operations and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other general taxes expense and thus are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes that electric and gas margins provide a meaningful basis for evaluating and managing utility operations since fuel for electric generation, purchase power costs, and cost of gas sold are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments. The presentation of utility electric and gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. These electric and gas margins may not be comparable to how other entities calculate utility electric and gas margin or similar measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table provides a calculation of electric and gas margins (non-GAAP), along with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, operating income:\n\nElectric sales and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's electric revenues and electric kWh sales by customer class for each of the years indicated:\n\n 30 \n \nElectric margin, a non-GAAP measure, decreased $8.3 million during 2018 compared to 2017, due to the following:\n\n\u00b7\nRevenue subject to refund. For cost recovery mechanisms, any over-collection of the difference between actual costs incurred and the amount of costs collected from customers is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred.\no\nTax Act. MGE received a PSCW order in January 2018 to defer the over-collection of income tax expense collected in customer rates as a result of the Tax Act reduction in federal income tax rate to 21 percent. During 2018, MGE recorded a $4.4 million reduction in retail electric revenues and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability. During 2018, MGE returned $6.3 million to electric customers through bill credits related to the tax credit.\no\nFuel-related costs. MGE's fuel-related costs subject to refund decreased revenue $5.3 million. MGE returned $4.2 million and $6.2 million of electric fuel-related savings in October 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MGE has deferred $9.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of fuel-related savings. Under fuel rules, MGE is required to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a 2% cost tolerance band around the amount used in the most recent rate proceeding. Beginning in 2018, over-collection of fuel-related costs outside the tolerance band are reflected as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred. Under-collection of costs outside the tolerance band is reflected as a reduction of purchase power expense in the period incurred. Any potential recovery of excess fuel costs will be recorded in the period received. Prior to adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, effective January 1, 2018, deferred fuel-related costs were reflected in purchased power expense, with potential refunds associated with fuel savings increasing that expense and potential recovery of excess fuel costs decreasing that expense.\no\nTransmission. MGE's transmission costs subject to refund decreased revenue $2.2 million primarily related to a one-time refund received in June 2018.\no\nOperating Costs. MGE's electric plant operating costs subject to refund decreased revenue $4.1 million primarily related to lower leased generation costs due to the reduction in tax rate.\n\u00b7\nOther. During 2018, other items affecting electric operating revenues decreased $1.8 million primarily attributable to a decrease in demand charges as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state.\n\u00b7\nVolume. During 2018, there was an 8.4% increase in residential electric sales volumes compared to the same period in the prior year driven by favorable weather conditions. During 2018, there was a 8.4% decrease in industrial retail electric sales volumes compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state.\n\u00b7\nFuel Costs. Fuel costs decreased during 2018, primarily as a result of a reduction in purchased power. The purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center in April 2018 replaced an existing purchase power agreement that was previously recorded as purchased power expense in fuel costs.\n 31 \n \nGas deliveries and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's gas revenues and gas therms delivered by customer class during each of the years indicated:\n\nGas margin, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.6 million during 2018 compared to 2017, due to the following:\n\n\u00b7\nVolume. For 2018, retail gas deliveries increased 11.8% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to customer growth and more favorable weather conditions in the current year.\n\u00b7\nRevenue subject to refund/tax credit. MGE received a PSCW order in January 2018 to defer the over-collection of income tax expense collected in customer rates as a result of the Tax Act reduction in federal income tax rate to 21 percent. Any over-collection of the difference between actual costs incurred and the amount of costs collected from customers is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred. For 2018, MGE recorded a $1.5 million reduction in retail gas revenues and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability. During 2018, MGE returned $1.9 million to gas customers through bill credits related to the tax credit.\nConsolidated operations and maintenance expenses\nFor 2018, operations and maintenance expenses increased $0.1 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The following contributed to the net change:\n\nFor 2018, decreased electric transmission costs are primarily related to a decrease in transmission rates as a result of a one-time refund received in June 2018. The lower transmission rate is reflected in customer revenue as revenue subject to refund.\nConsolidated depreciation expense\nElectric depreciation expense increased $2.3 million and gas depreciation expense increased $1.0 million for 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in depreciable assets and change in estimated useful lives of capitalized software assets affected by the technology corporate initiative.\n 32 \n \nNonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2018 and 2017, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $20.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively. The decrease in net income is attributable to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact in 2017 as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. The decrease in tax rate lowered lease revenues and income tax expense in 2018. Income tax expense is a factor used in the formula to calculate lease rates. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nTransmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nFor 2018 and 2017, other income at the transmission investment segment was $8.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The decrease in tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, lowered earnings from ATC and income tax expense for 2018. Income tax expense is a factor used in the calculation of ATC's transmission rates. The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of the investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016. In the near term, it is expected that ATC Holdco will be pursuing transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.\nConsolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE\nAlthough effective tax rates have been lowered as a result of the Tax Act, regulated revenues have been affected as tax expense is a factor in the determination of rates for electric and gas service, and rates relating to our investment in transmission. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details of effective income tax rates for continuing operations.\nNoncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE\nThe noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The following table shows MGE Energy's noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflected on MGE's consolidated statement of income:\n\n(a)\nIn 2017, there was a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\n 33 \n \nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nElectric Utility Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nElectric sales and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's electric revenues and electric kWh sales by customer class for each of the years indicated:\n\nn.m.: not meaningful\nElectric operating revenues increased $4.9 million or 1.2% during 2017, due to the following:\n\n\u00b7\nDeferral of fuel savings/fuel credit. During 2017, customers received a fuel credit on their bill related to accumulated fuel savings of $6.2 million, which decreased electric revenues. During 2016, customers received a fuel credit on their bill related to the fuel savings of $23.7 million, which decreased electric revenues in the prior year. In January 2016, the PSCW lowered MGE's 2016 fuel rules monitored costs as a result of continued lower projected fuel costs in 2016.\n\u00b7\nAdjustments to Revenue. MGE leases electric generating capacity from MGE Power Elm Road. MGE collects in rates the lease payments associated with the electric generating capacity as authorized by the PSCW. Any differential between estimated lease payments collected in rates and actual lease payments paid to MGE Power Elm Road are included in adjustments to revenues.\n\u00b7\nVolume. During 2017, there was a 15.6% decrease in industrial retail sales volumes compared to the same period in 2016 as a result of a large industrial customer relocating its operations out of state. During 2017, there was a 4.3% decrease in residential sales volumes compared to the same period in 2016 driven by decreased customer demand due, at least in part, to less favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by the lower number of cooling degree days.\n\u00b7\nRate Changes. In December 2016, the PSCW authorized MGE to decrease 2017 rates for retail electric customers by 0.8% or $3.3 million on an annual basis.\nRates charged to retail customers for 2017, were 2.2% or $4.0 million lower than those charged during the same period in 2016.\n 34 \n \n\u00b7\nSales to the Market. Sales to the market represent wholesale sales made to third parties who are not ultimate users of the electricity. These sales may include spot market transactions on the markets operated by MISO and PJM. These sales may also include bilateral sales to other utilities or power marketers. Generating units are dispatched by MISO based on cost considerations as well as reliability of the system. Sales to the market typically occur when MGE has more generation and purchases online than are needed for its own system demand. The excess electricity is then sold to others in the market. For 2017, market volumes decreased compared to the same period in 2016, reflecting decreased opportunities for sales, and those sales were made at lower market prices. The revenue generated from these sales is included in fuel rules monitored costs. See fuel rules discussion in Footnote 8.b. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nElectric fuel and purchased power\nElectric fuel and purchased power costs reflect a decrease in internal generation volumes partially offset by an increase in the volume of purchased power when compared to 2016. Adjustments related to the regulatory recovery for fuel costs, known as fuel rules, increased purchased power expense. These items are explained below.\nFuel for electric generation\nThe expense for fuel for internal electric generation decreased $7.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the following:\n\nThis decrease in expense reflects an 8.1% decrease in internal generation volume delivered to the system primarily as a result of decreased generation at WCCF based on market prices and a 5.0% decrease in per-unit cost of internal electric generation.\nPurchased power\nPurchased power expense increased $2.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the following:\n\nThe increase in expense (before fuel rules adjustments) reflects a 4.9% increase in the volume of power purchased from third parties, partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in the per-unit cost of purchased power.\nUnder fuel rules, MGE is required to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a 2% cost tolerance band around the amount used in the most recent rate proceeding. Any fuel rules adjustments are reflected in purchased power expense, with potential refunds associated with fuel savings increasing that expense and potential recovery of excess fuel costs decreasing that expense.\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses increased $3.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The following changes contributed to the net change:\n\n 35 \n \nFor 2017, increased transmission costs are primarily due to an increase in transmission reliability enhancements and increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to technology improvements, partially offset by decreased production costs at Columbia and the Elm Road Units.\nElectric depreciation expense\nElectric depreciation expense increased $7.5 million during 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of new depreciation rates for Columbia, as approved by the PSCW.\nOther electric income\nOther electric income increased $1.0 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of property assets.\nGas Utility Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nGas deliveries and revenues\nThe following table compares MGE's gas revenues and gas therms delivered by customer class during each of the years indicated:\n\nGas revenues increased $14.3 million or 10.6% during 2017. These changes are related to the following factors:\n\n\u00b7\nRate/PGA changes. In December 2016, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2017 rates for retail gas customers by 1.9% or $3.1 million on an annual basis.\nMGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the purchased gas adjustment clause (PGA). Under the PGA, MGE is able to pass through to its gas customers the cost of gas. Changes in PGA recoveries affect revenues but do not impact net income.\nThe average retail rate per therm for 2017 increased 6.5% compared to 2016, reflecting a $6.5 million increase in natural gas commodity costs (recovered through the PGA). Additionally, there was an increase in fixed rate charges.\n\u00b7\nVolume. For 2017, retail gas deliveries increased 4.3% compared to 2016. The increase in volume is primarily related to customer growth and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016.\nCost of gas sold\nFor 2017, cost of gas sold increased by $9.9 million, compared to 2016. The cost per therm of natural gas increased 9.2%, which resulted in $6.5 million of increased expense. The volume of gas purchased increased 5.1%, which resulted in $3.4 million of increased expense.\n 36 \n \nGas operating and maintenance expenses\nGas operating and maintenance expenses increased $1.6 million for 2017 compared to 2016. The following changes contributed to the net change:\n\nFor 2017, increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to technology improvements. Increased customer service costs are due to higher Focus on Energy payments. Focus on Energy is Wisconsin's statewide energy efficiency and renewable resource program to promote energy efficiency on customer's premises. Decreased administrative and general costs are primarily related to a decrease in payroll expense.\nNonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2017 and 2016, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $40.5 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The increase in net income is attributable to a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nTransmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nFor 2017 and 2016, other income at the transmission investment segment was $9.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of the investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016. In the near term, it is expected that ATC Holdco will be pursuing transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and \"Other Matters\" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.\nAll Other Operations - MGE Energy and MGE\nOther income\nThe decrease in all other income primarily results from a $2 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation.\nConsolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE\nMGE Energy's effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 18.5% and 36.0%, respectively. MGE's effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 17.0% and 35.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for both MGE Energy and MGE in 2017 was primarily related to the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Tax Act, deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, were remeasured to reflect the decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details of effective income tax rates for continuing operations.\nNoncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE\nThe noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Also included in noncontrolling interest, net of tax, for 2016 is MGE Energy's interest in MGE Transco, which holds our investment in ATC.\n 37 \n \nThe following table shows MGE Energy's noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflected on MGE's consolidated statement of income:\n\n(a)\nIn 2017, there was a $21.6 million one-time tax impact as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\n(b)\nMGE Transco holds an ownership interest in ATC. In July 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco declined below a majority, resulting in MGE Energy's investment in MGE Transco being deconsolidated from MGE's consolidated financial statements. See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of noncontrolling interest. In December 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco was transferred to MGE Energy. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMGE Energy and MGE have adequate liquidity to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Available resources include cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, liquid assets, borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities, and access to equity and debt capital markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes cash flows for MGE Energy and MGE during 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nMGE Energy\nMGE Energy's consolidated net cash provided by operating activities is derived mainly from the electric and gas operations of its principal subsidiary, MGE.\n2018 vs. 2017\nCash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $153.0 million, an increase of $21.7 million when compared to the prior year.\nMGE Energy's net income decreased $13.4 million for 2018 when compared to the prior year primarily related to a $21.6 million one-time 2017 noncash tax impact of the Tax Act from the nonregulated energy segment.\nMGE Energy's federal and state taxes paid decreased $14.6 million during 2018, when compared to the prior year, reflecting the reduction in tax rates effected by the Tax Act.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $10.5 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, primarily due to increased current liabilities, decreased unbilled revenues, and decreased inventories, partially offset by decreased accounts payable and increased receivables.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $12.7 million in cash used for operating activities for 2017, primarily due to decreased accounts payable, increased receivables, increased inventories, and increased unbilled revenues, partially offset by increased current liabilities.\n 38 \n \nA decrease in pension contribution resulted in an additional $5.7 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, when compared to the prior year.

Excluding the 2016 refund, MGE's federal and state taxes paid to MGE Energy increased $5.2 million during 2017, when compared to 2016.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $14.2 million in cash used for operating activities for 2017, primarily due to decreased accounts payable, increased receivables, increased inventories, and increased unbilled revenues, partially offset by increased current liabilities.\nWorking capital accounts (excluding prepaid and accrued taxes) resulted in $7.8 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, primarily due to increased accounts payable, decreased inventories, and decreased receivable margin, partially offset by increased receivables, increased unbilled revenues, and decreased current liabilities. The decrease in current liabilities includes a fuel credit, approved in August 2015, of $8.3 million that customers received on their bill throughout 2016 and a one-time fuel credit, approved in July 2016, of $15.5 million that customers received on their bill in September 2016.\nA decrease in pension contribution resulted in an additional $3.2 million in cash provided by operating activities for 2017, when compared to 2016. Pension contributions reflect amounts required by law and discretionary amounts.\nIn 2016, MGE received dividends of $5.0 million from ATC. In December 2016, MGE's ownership interest in MGE Transco was transferred to MGE Energy.\nCapital Requirements and Investing Activities\nMGE Energy\n2018 vs. 2017\nMGE Energy's cash used for investing activities increased $102.1 million for 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nCapital expenditures for 2018 were $212.2 million. This amount represents an increase of $104.1 million from the expenditures made in the prior year. This increase primarily reflects increased expenditures on the construction of the Saratoga wind project and the purchase of Forward Wind.\nCapital contributions in ATC and other investments decreased $5.2 million for 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nMGE Energy received $2.8 million in proceeds from the sales of property in 2017.\n2017 vs. 2016\nMGE Energy's cash used for investing activities increased $29.5 million for 2017 when compared to 2016.\nCapital expenditures for 2017 were $108.1 million. This amount represents an increase of $24.5 million from the expenditures made in 2016. This increase primarily reflects increased expenditures on electric assets.\nCapital contributions in ATC and other investments increased $8.1 million for 2017 when compared to 2016.\nMGE Energy received $2.8 million in proceeds from the sales of property in 2017.\nMGE\n2018 vs. 2017\nMGE's cash used for investing activities increased $106.7 million for 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nCapital expenditures for 2018 were $212.2 million.

This amount represents an increase of $24.5 million from the expenditures made in 2016. This increase primarily reflects increased expenditures on electric assets.\nCapital contributions in ATC and other investments decreased $1.6 million in 2017, when compared to 2016. In December 2016, MGE transferred its ownership interest in ATC to MGE Energy. See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further details.\nMGE received $1.7 million in proceeds from the sales of property in 2017.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table shows MGE Energy's actual capital expenditures for both 2018 and 2017, forecasted capital expenditures for 2019, and annual average forecasted capital expenditures for the years 2020 through 2022:\n\nThe Saratoga Wind Farm began construction in 2018. This project accounts for $95.8 million of the capital expenditures for 2018.\nMGE Energy used funds received as dividend payments from MGE Power West Campus and MGE Power Elm Road, internally generated cash, and long-term and short-term external financing to meet its 2018 capital requirements and cash obligations, including dividend payments. External financing included short-term financing under existing lines of credit.\nThe forecasted capital expenditures are based upon management's assumptions with respect to future events, including the timing and amount of expenditures associated with compliance with environmental compliance initiatives, load growth, and the timing and adequacy of rate recovery. Actual events may differ materially from those assumptions and result in material changes to those forecasted amounts.\nIn May 2018, MGE and WPSC filed a joint application with the PSCW for the approval to acquire 300 MW of solar generating capacity from two separate solar projects in Wisconsin, Badger Hollow Solar Farm and Two Creeks Solar Farm. MGE's combined ownership share of the two projects is expected to be 100 MW. If approved by the PSCW, construction of the projects is expected to begin in 2019. MGE's share of the construction cost is expected to be approximately $130 million. The application is pending approval by the PSCW and is excluded from the forecasted capital expenditures noted above.\nFinancing Activities\nMGE Energy\n2018 vs. 2017\nCash provided by MGE Energy's financing activities was $38.1 million for 2018, compared to $4.6 million of cash used for 2017.\nFor 2018, cash dividends paid were $45.8 million compared to $43.7 million in the prior year. This increase was a result of a higher dividend per share ($1.32 vs. $1.26).\n 41 \n \nDuring 2018, MGE issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $20.0 million of maturing long-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures. The increase in long-term debt primarily reflects expenditures on the construction of the Saratoga wind project. During 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2018, net short-term debt borrowings were $9.0 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year.\n2017 vs. 2016\nCash used for MGE Energy's financing activities was $4.6 million for 2017, compared to $46.1 million of cash used for 2016.\nFor 2017, cash dividends paid were $43.7 million compared to $41.8 million in 2016. This increase was a result of a higher dividend per share $1.26 vs. $1.21).\nDuring 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2017, short-term debt borrowings were $4.0 million. There were no short-term borrowings for 2016.\nMGE\n2018 vs. 2017\nDuring 2018, cash provided by MGE's financing activities was $61.9 million, compared to $23.9 million of cash used for MGE's financing activities in the prior year.\nCash dividends paid from MGE to MGE Energy were $45.0 million in the prior year. There were no cash dividends paid from MGE to MGE Energy for 2018.\nDistributions to parent (MGE Energy) from noncontrolling interest, which represent distributions from MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, were $22.0 million for 2018, compared to $18.0 million in the prior year.\nDuring 2018, MGE issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $20.0 million of maturing long-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures. The increase in long-term debt primarily reflects expenditures on the construction of the Saratoga wind project. During 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2018, net short-term debt borrowings were $9.0 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year.\n2017 vs. 2016\nDuring 2017, cash used for MGE's financing activities was $23.9 million, compared to $76.8 million of cash used for MGE's financing activities in 2016.\nCash dividends paid from MGE to MGE Energy were $45.0 million for 2017, compared to $50.0 million in 2016.\nDistributions to parent (MGE Energy) from noncontrolling interest, which represent distributions from MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, were $18.0 million for 2017, compared to $24.1 million in 2016.\nFor 2016, equity contributions received from noncontrolling interest, which represent contributions by MGE Energy to MGE Transco, were $1.6 million. There were no equity contributions received from noncontrolling interest, which represent contributions to MGE Transco for 2017, as MGE Transco was a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGE Energy during 2017.\nDuring 2017, MGE issued $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which was used to refinance $30.0 million of medium-term notes and assist with financing additional capital expenditures.\nFor 2017, short-term borrowings were $4.0 million. There were no short-term borrowings for 2016.\n 42 \n \nDividend Restrictions\nDividend payments by MGE to MGE Energy are subject to restrictions arising under a PSCW rate order and, to a lesser degree, MGE's first mortgage bonds. The PSCW order restricts any dividends, above the PSCW authorized amount of $70.8 million, that MGE may pay MGE Energy if its common equity ratio, calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding, is less than 55%. MGE's thirteen month rolling average common equity ratio as of December 31, 2018, is 56.3%, as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding. This restriction did not impact MGE's payment of dividends in 2018. Cash dividends of $45.0 million were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2017. No cash dividends were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2018. The rate proceeding calculation includes as indebtedness imputed amounts for MGE's outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other PSCW adjustments but does not include the indebtedness associated with MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, which are consolidated into MGE's financial statements but are not direct obligations of MGE.\nMGE has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases, after December 31, 1945, shall not exceed the earned surplus (retained earnings) accumulated subsequent to December 31, 1945. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $400.0 million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant.\nCredit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2018, MGE Energy and MGE had the following aggregate bank commitments and available capacity under their credit agreements:\n\n(a)\nOn February 7, 2019, MGE Energy and MGE amended and restated the credit agreements to extend the initial term expiration date to February 7, 2024.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreements may bear interest at a rate based upon either a \"floating rate\" or a \"Eurodollar Rate\" adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an adder based upon the credit ratings assigned to MGE's senior unsecured long-term debt securities. The \"floating rate\" is calculated on a daily basis as the highest of a prime rate, a Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum, or a Eurodollar Rate for a one-month interest period plus 1%. The \"floating rate\" adder ranges from zero to 0.125%. The \"Eurodollar Rate\" is calculated as provided in the Credit Agreements. The \"Eurodollar Rate\" adder ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%.\nThe credit agreements require the borrower to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization not to exceed a maximum of 65%. The ratio calculation excludes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in MGE's financial statements as a result of the consolidation of VIEs, such as MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. As of December 31, 2018, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization for each of MGE Energy and MGE, as calculated under the credit agreements' covenant, were 38.5% and 43.0%, respectively. See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information regarding the credit facilities.\nCapitalization Ratios\nMGE Energy's capitalization ratios were as follows:\n\n(a)\nIncludes the current portion of long-term debt.\n 43 \n \nCredit Ratings\nMGE Energy's and MGE's access to the capital markets, including, in the case of MGE, the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the credit ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.\nNone of MGE Energy's or MGE's borrowing is subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrading of MGE's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges under both MGE Energy's and MGE's credit agreements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments for MGE Energy and MGE\nMGE Energy's and MGE's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, representing cash obligations that are considered to be firm commitments, are as follows:\n\n(a)\nLong-term debt consisting of secured first mortgage bonds, unsecured medium-term notes, and Industrial Development Revenue Bonds issued by MGE, and private placement debt issued by MGE, MGE Power Elm Road, and MGE Power West Campus.\n(b)\nShort-term debt consisting of commercial paper for MGE. See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\n(c)\nChattel paper agreements. See Footnote 1.g. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\n(d)\nAmount represents interest expense on long-term debt. See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of the long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\n(e)\nOperating leases. See Footnote 17.b. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\n(f)\nPurchase obligations for MGE Energy and MGE consist primarily of the purchase of electricity and natural gas, electric transmission, natural gas storage capacity, natural gas pipeline transportation, and the purchase and transport of coal. See Footnote 17.a. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\n(g)\nOther obligations are primarily related to investment commitments, easements, environmental projects, fuel credit, and uncertain tax positions.\nThe above amounts do not include any contributions for MGE's pension and postretirement plans. MGE does not expect to need to make any required contributions to the qualified plans for 2019 or 2020. The contributions for years after 2020 are not yet currently estimated. Due to uncertainties in the future economic performance of plan assets, discount rates, and other key assumptions, estimated contributions are subject to change. MGE may also elect to make additional discretionary contributions to the plans.\nThe above amounts do not include future capital calls by ATC and ATC Holdco. In January 2019, MGE Transco made a $0.2 million capital contribution to ATC, and MGEE Transco made a $0.1 million capital contribution to ATC Holdco. The amount and timing of future capital calls to these entities is uncertain and primarily dependent on the operations and expansion of ATC and ATC Holdco.\n 44 \n \nMGE Energy's and MGE's commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018, representing commitments triggered by future events and including financing arrangements to secure obligations of MGE Energy and MGE, are as follows:\n\n(a)\nAmount includes the facilities discussed in (b) plus an additional line of credit. MGE Energy has available at any time a $50 million committed revolving credit agreement, expiring in June 2020. As of December 31, 2018, MGE Energy had no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.\n(b)\nAmount includes two committed revolving credit agreements totaling $100 million expiring in June 2020. These credit facilities are used to support commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2018, MGE had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities. On that date, MGE had $13.0 million of commercial paper outstanding.\n(c)\nOn February 7, 2019, MGE Energy and MGE amended and restated the credit agreements to extend the initial term expiration date to February 7, 2024.\nOther Matters\nATC\nIn 2013, several parties filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the base return on equity (ROE) used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, \"due to changes in the capital markets.\" The complaint alleged that the MISO ROE should not exceed 9.15%, the equity components of hypothetical capital structures should be restricted to 50%, and the relevant incentive ROE adders should be discontinued. At the time, MISO's base ROE was 12.38% and ATC's base ROE was 12.2%. In February 2015, a second complaint was filed for the period February 2015 through May 2015 with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to the filing date of the complaint. In June 2016, an administrative law judge issued an initial decision for the second complaint that would reduce the transmission owner's base ROE to 9.7%. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. It is anticipated FERC will issue an order on this issue in 2019. On September 28, 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint, for the period November 2013 through February 2015, reducing the base ROE to 10.32%. This base ROE also became effective September 28, 2016, and will apply to future periods until FERC rules in the second complaint, at which time the base ROE ordered by FERC in the second complaint will prospectively become the authorized base ROE. Any change to ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future.\nIn January 2015, FERC accepted the transmission owner's request for a 50 basis-point incentive ROE adder for participating in MISO. The adder became effective January 6, 2015.\nOur share of ATC's earnings reflects a pre-tax adjustment of $0.5 million and $1.9 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, recorded by ATC for these matters representing its estimate of its refund liability. There was not a pre-tax expense for 2018. We derived approximately 7.3%, 6.2%, and 6.8% of our net income for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, from our investment in ATC.\nCritical Accounting Estimates - MGE Energy and MGE\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to unbilled revenues, allowance for doubtful accounts, pension obligations, income taxes, derivatives, and regulatory assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Those values may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n 45 \n \nUnbilled Revenues\nRevenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are recorded when electricity/gas is delivered to those customers. The quantity of those sales is measured by customers' meters. Due to the large volume of those meters, it is impractical to read all of them at month end. Meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter-reading schedules. Consequently, at the end of any month, there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings. As a result, management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter-read dates and the end of the period. These estimates include:\n\u00b7\nThe amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers (line loss) and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers.\n\u00b7\nThe amount of gas expected to be lost in the process of its distribution to customers and the amount of gas actually delivered to customers.\n\u00b7\nThe mix of sales between customer rate classes, which is based upon historical utilization assumptions.\nMGE monitors the reasonableness of the unbilled revenue estimate through the review of ratios such as unbilled electric consumption compared to billed electric sales. In the case of unbilled gas, the estimated unbilled consumption is compared to various other statistics, including percent of gas available for sale, change in unbilled month to month and change in unbilled compared to the prior year in order to confirm its reasonableness.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nMGE maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. It determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, regional economic data, and review of the accounts receivable aging. MGE reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Although management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is MGE's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses, if the financial condition of MGE's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nMGE provides employees with certain retirement (pension) and postretirement (health care and life insurance) benefits. In order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, the rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, health care trends, mortality rates, and other factors. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure. Different estimates used by us could result in recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Recovery in rates is expected.\nMGE uses third-party specialists to assist us in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on available investment yields and the historical performance of our plan assets. They are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management's judgment and can materially affect net income.\n\u00b7\nAssumed return on assets. This assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested (or to be invested) to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. For 2018, MGE used an assumed return on assets of 7.40% for pension and 6.94% for other postretirement benefits. In 2019, the pension asset assumption will decrease to 7.20% and the postretirement benefit assumption will decrease to 6.72%. The annual expected rate of return is based on projected long-term equity and bond returns, maturities and asset allocations. Holding other assumptions constant, for every 1% reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets, annual pension and other postretirement cost would increase by approximately $4.0 million, before taxes.\n\u00b7\nDiscount rate. The discount rate represents the rate at which pension obligations could effectively be settled on a present-value basis. MGE uses high-grade bond yields as a benchmark for determining the appropriate discount rate. MGE uses individual spot rates, instead of a weighted average of the yield curve spot rates, for measuring the service cost and interest cost components for net periodic benefit cost. Holding other assumptions constant, a 0.5%\n 46 \n \nreduction in the discount rate on the obligation balance as of December 31, 2018, would increase annual pension and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.6 million, before taxes.\n\u00b7\nMedical trend assumptions. The health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per-capita health care charges.\n\u00b7\nMortality rate assumption. Expected mortality rates are used in the valuation to determine the expected duration of future benefit payments to the plan participants. MGE utilizes mortality tables and projection scales developed by a third-party actuary that were updated in 2018.\nSee Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional discussion of these plans.\nIncome Tax Provision\nMGE Energy's and MGE's income tax provisions, including both current and deferred components, are based on estimates, assumptions, calculations, and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years. Determination of current-year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years.\nManagement regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final.\nAdditionally, in determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recorded for those benefits that do not meet this criterion. We record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. The passing of the law significantly lowers MGE's corporate tax rates and triggered a remeasurement of deferred taxes. We reflected estimates of the impact of the Tax Act in our year-end 2017 financial results. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, any subsequent adjustment to these amounts would be recorded in 2018 when the analysis is complete. No material adjustments have been recorded during 2018. Furthermore, while regulation allows us to incorporate changes in tax law into the rate-setting process, there will likely be timing delays before realization of the changes.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all tax positions and requires a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. The threshold is defined for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as \"more likely than not\" that the position is sustainable, based on its merits. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nMGE accounts for derivative financial instruments, except those qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale exception, at their fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value is determined using current quoted market prices, except for the PPA, which is valued utilizing an internally-developed pricing model. This model includes observable and unobservable inputs.\nMGE received approval from the PSCW to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark-to-market accounting on contracts related to commodity hedging in MGE's regulated operations.\n 47 \n \nRegulatory Assets/Liabilities\nRegulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates. MGE bases its assessment of recovery on precedents established by the regulatory body. Regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities typically include deferral of energy costs, the normalization of income taxes, the deferral of certain operating expenses, and non-ARO removal costs. The accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with regulatory accounting standards.\nMGE continually assesses whether the regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current-period revenues or expenses.\nAmortization of regulatory assets and liabilities is provided over the recovery or deferral period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement.\nAdoption of Accounting Principles and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - MGE Energy and MGE\nSee

down from $97.6 million in 2017, primarily due to a one-time $21.6 million tax benefit in 2017 from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n\n- The electric utility segment saw higher operating income in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by more favorable weather conditions. The gas utility segment also had higher operating income due to colder weather and customer growth.\n\n- The nonregulated energy segment saw lower income in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the one-time tax impact in 2017. The transmission investment segment also had lower earnings in 2018 due to the lower tax rate.\n\n- In 2018, MGE invested significantly in projects like the Saratoga Wind Farm construction and purchase of Forward Wind. Total capital expenditures were $212 million in 2018 compared to $108 million in 2017.\n\n- Key business developments include the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impact, reduced ownership in the Columbia plant, construction of the Saratoga Wind Farm, purchase of Forward Wind, and a 2019-2020 electric and gas rate case settlement.\n\n- The report discusses critical accounting estimates like unbilled revenue, pension obligations, income taxes, and regulatory assets/liabilities. It also covers recent accounting pronouncements adopted."}
