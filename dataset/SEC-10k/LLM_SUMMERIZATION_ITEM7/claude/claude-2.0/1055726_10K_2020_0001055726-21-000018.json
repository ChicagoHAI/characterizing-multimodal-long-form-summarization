MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on our current expectations and projections, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We are under no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the filing of this Annual Report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including without limitation the disclosures made in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report under the Caption Risk Factors.\u201d\nRisk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: our history of losses; our lack of products that have received regulatory approval; uncertainties inherent in clinical trials and product development programs, including but not limited to the fact that pre-clinical and clinical results may not be indicative of results achievable in other trials or for other indications, that the studies or trials may not be successful or achieve desired results, that preclinical studies and clinical trials may not commence, have sufficient enrollment or be completed in the time periods anticipated, that results from one study may not necessarily be reflected or supported by the results of other similar studies, that results from an animal study may not be indicative of results achievable in human studies, that clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, that the outcome of any clinical trial is uncertain and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process, and that our electroporation technology and DNA vaccines may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits in clinical trials; the availability of funding; the ability to manufacture vaccine candidates; the availability or potential availability of alternative therapies or treatments for the conditions targeted by us or our collaborators, including alternatives that may be more efficacious or cost-effective than any therapy or treatment that we and our collaborators hope to develop; our ability to receive development, regulatory and commercialization event-based payments under our collaborative agreements; whether our proprietary rights are enforceable or defensible or infringe or allegedly infringe on rights of others or can withstand claims of invalidity; and the impact of government healthcare laws and proposals.\nOverview\nINOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on rapidly bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Our DNA medicines pipeline is comprised of three types of product candidates: DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies and DNA encoded monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs\u00ae). In clinical trials, we have demonstrated that DNA medicines can be delivered directly into cells in the body through our proprietary smart device to consistently activate robust and fully functional T cell and antibody responses against targeted pathogens and cancers.\nOur novel DNA medicine candidates are made using our proprietary SynCon\u00ae technology that uses a computer algorithm designed to identify and optimize the DNA sequence of the target antigen (be it virus or a tumor). INOVIO then creates optimized plasmids, which are circular strands of DNA that instruct a cell to produce antigens to help the person's immune system recognize and destroy cancerous or virally infected cells.\nOur patented CELLECTRA\u00ae smart delivery devices provide optimized uptake of our DNA medicines within the cell, overcoming a key limitation of other DNA-based technology approaches, namely cellular uptake.\nHuman clinical trial data to date has shown a favorable safety profile of our DNA medicines delivered directly into cells in the body using the CELLECTRA\u00ae smart device in more than 7,000 administrations across more than 3,000 patients.\nOur corporate strategy is to advance, protect and, once approved, commercialize our novel DNA medicines to meet urgent and emerging global health needs. We continue to advance and clinically validate an array of DNA medicine candidates that target HPV-associated diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). We aim to advance these candidates through commercialization and continue to leverage third-party resources through collaborations and partnerships, including product license agreements.\nOur partners and collaborators include ApolloBio Corp., AstraZeneca, Advaccine, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), GeneOne Life Science, HIV Vaccines Trial Network, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC), International Vaccine Institute (IVI), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Ology Bioservices, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Plumbline Life Sciences, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Richter-Helm BioLogics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, the University of Pennsylvania, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and The Wistar Institute.\nWe or our collaborators are currently conducting or planning clinical studies of our DNA medicines for HPV-associated precancers, including cervical, vulvar, and anal dysplasia; HPV-associated cancers, including head & neck, cervical, anal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal; other HPV-associated disorders, such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, or RRP; glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM; prostate cancer; HIV; Ebola; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS; Lassa fever; Zika virus; and the COVID-19 virus.\nAll of our product candidates are in the research and development phase. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate any such revenues for at least the next several years. We earn revenue from license fees and milestone revenue and collaborative research and development agreements. Our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing. All product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use, and will require significant costs for commercialization. We may not be successful in our research and development efforts, and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $906.2 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future due to our commitment to our research and development programs, the funding of preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of general and administrative activities.\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a number of significant impacts on our business during 2020. Most notably, in the United States, South Korea and China, we have accelerated the clinical development of INO-4800, our DNA vaccine candidate matched to the outbreak strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In January, we received initial grant funding from CEPI to advance INO-4800 into preclinical studies and clinical development through Phase 1 human testing. We had previously been awarded grants from CEPI for the development of other DNA vaccines against Lassa fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, which is also caused by a coronavirus like COVID-19. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States in April, and in June we reported positive interim data from the first two cohorts of the trial. In December 2020, we dosed the first subject in the Phase 2 segment of our Phase 2/3 clinical trial called INNOVATE (INovio INO-4800 Vaccine Trial for Efficacy). We have fully enrolled approximately 400 participants in the Phase 2 segment who are 18 years or older at 17 U.S. sites to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in order to confirm the dose(s) for the subsequent efficacy evaluation as part of the Phase 3 segment of the trial, once the FDA allows us to proceed. The Phase 3 segment of the INNOVATE remains on partial clinical hold until we satisfactorily resolve the FDA's remaining questions related to the CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 device that will be used to deliver INO-4800 into the cells of the skin. We plan to satisfy the remaining device questions during the conduct of Phase 2 segment and prior to the start of the Phase 3 segment of INNOVATE. In the Phase 3 segment of the trial, we intend to enroll healthy men and non-pregnant women 18 years and older, to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed dosing level(s) for each age group based on the data from the Phase 2 evaluation. Participants will be enrolled in a one-to-one randomization to receive either INO-4800 or a placebo. The Phase 3 segment will be case-driven with the final number of enrollees to be determined by the incidence of COVID-19 during the Phase 3 segment. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 segment will be virologically-confirmed COVID-19 disease.\nWe have also initiated clinical trials of INO-4800 in South Korea and China. In April, CEPI awarded us a grant of $6.9 million to work with International Vaccine Institute and the Korea National Institute of Health to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial, which was the first COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial approved in South Korea. In China, we are collaborating with Advaccine and have dosed 640 subjects with the first vaccination in a Phase 2 clinical trial in China. The Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China has enrolled both adults who are 18-59 years old and older adults (60 years and older) with the primary endpoints of evaluating safety and immunogenicity within the Chinese population.\nIn parallel with our accelerated clinical development efforts, we have engaged a network of partners for the planned large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800 if it achieves regulatory approval. In March, the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, awarded Ology Bioservices Inc. a contract to manufacture INO-4800 for the DoD to be used in upcoming clinical trials. In April, we entered into an agreement with the German contract manufacturer Richter-Helm BioLogics GmbH & Co. KG and expanded our preexisting manufacturing partnership to support large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800. In March, we also received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for accelerated testing and scale up of our CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP proprietary smart device for the intradermal delivery of INO-4800. In June, the DoD awarded us $71.1 million to support the large-scale manufacture of CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP, production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 devices that\nare used to deliver INO-4800 intradermally. In the second half of 2020, we added Thermo Fisher Scientific and Kaneka Eurogentec S.A., an affiliate of Kaneka Corporation, to our manufacturing consortium.\nOperationally, we have not experienced significant disruptions to date as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the outbreak, a number of governmental orders and other public health guidance measures were implemented across much of the United States, including in the locations of our offices, laboratories, clinical trial sites and third parties on whom we rely. We have implemented a work from home policy allowing employees who can work from home to do so, while those needing to work in laboratory facilities work in shifts to reduce the number of people gathered together at one time. Business travel has been suspended, and online and teleconference technology is used to meet virtually rather than in person. We have taken measures to secure our research and development project activities, while work in laboratories has been organized to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission.\nTo date, our liquidity has also not been negatively impacted by the pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised $454.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through our \"at-the-market\" equity offering program, which further enhanced our liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $411.6 million, compared to $89.5 million as of December 31, 2019. In addition, in January 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of $162.1 million.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, collaborators and service providers. The extent to which the pandemic will impact our business and operations will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including mass vaccination efforts, that are highly uncertain. For additional information on the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the Risk Factors\u201d section above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies include:\nCollaboration Agreements\nWe assess whether our collaboration agreements are subject to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 808: Collaborative Arrangements ( Topic 808\u201d) based on whether they involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of Topic 808, we assesses whether the payments between us and the collaboration partner are subject to other accounting literature. If payments from the collaboration partner to us represent consideration from a customer, then we account for those payments within the scope of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d). However, if we concludes that our collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities, such as for certain collaborative research and development activities, we present such payments as a reduction of research and development expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services agreed upon within each contract and assess whether each good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment of one or more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) product supply services; (iii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iv) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non-refundable, upfront fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment of management to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligation. The standalone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied at a point in time or over time. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.\nLicense Fees\nIf a license to intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nProduct Supply Services\nArrangements that include a promise for future supply of drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the licensee's discretion are generally considered as options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. We evaluate whether we are the principal or agent in the arrangement. We have determined that we are the principal in current arrangements as we control the product supply before it is transferred to the customer.\nMilestone Payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achieving such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our collaborative arrangements.\nGrants\nWe account for various grant agreements under the contributions guidance under Subtopic 958-605, Not-for-Profit Entities-Revenue Recognition, which is outside the scope of Topic 606, as the government agencies granting us funds are not receiving reciprocal value for their contributions. All contributions received from current grant agreements are recorded as a contra-expense as opposed to revenue on the consolidated statement of operations.\nLeases\nFor our long-term operating leases, we recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The lease liability is determined as the present value of future lease payments using an estimated rate of interest that we would pay to borrow equivalent funds on a collateralized basis at the lease commencement\ndate. The right-of-use asset is based on the liability adjusted for any prepaid or deferred rent. We determined the lease term at the commencement date by considering whether renewal options and termination options are reasonably assured of exercise.\nFixed rent expense for our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Variable lease payments including lease operating expenses are recorded as incurred.\nDerivative Liabilities\nWe evaluate our debt and equity issuances to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in our financial statements. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. In circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur activities have largely consisted of research and development efforts related to developing electroporation delivery technologies and DNA immunotherapies and vaccines. Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities and other overhead expenses, clinical trials, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred. These expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations and licensing arrangements. We review and accrue clinical trial expense based on work performed, relying on estimates of total trial management costs, sites activated, patients enrolled, and number of patient visits. We follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a research agreement or clinical trial can be made. Accrued clinical trial costs are subject to revisions as trials progress. Revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Historically, revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development expense; however a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table and the results of these periods are used in the discussion thereafter.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2019\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consisted of revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements, including arrangements with affiliated entities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our year over year total revenue increased $3.3 million, or 80%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue earned from Advaccine and the milestone revenue earned from our affiliated entity Plumbline Life Sciences, Inc., or PLS, offset by a decrease in revenue recognized from our collaboration with AstraZeneca.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe $6.2 million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher drug manufacturing expenses and outside services related to our INO-4800 clinical trials of $17.1 million, an increase in engineering services related to our CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP device development and array automation project of $12.4 million, higher expensed device materials of $5.0 million, higher contract labor expense of $2.4 million, higher employee stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million, higher drug manufacturing expenses related to our Wistar IPCAVD grant of $1.2 million and an increase in patent maintenance and milestone fees to Wistar of $1.1 million. These increases were offset by an increase in contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements of $33.5 million, among other variances.\nContributions received from current grant agreements and recorded as contra-research and development expense were $45.4 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase year over year was primarily due to increases of $21.2 million, $10.0 million and $4.1 million earned under grants from the DoD, CEPI and Gates, respectively, related to INO-4800 and device development activities, partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million earned from the Gates grant and Wistar sub-grant related to our dMAb technology, among other variances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $10.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily related to an increase in legal expenses of $5.2 million, an increase in expenses for work performed related to corporate marketing and communications of $3.1 million and higher employee and consultant stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million, partially offset by a gain on foreign exchange of $2.2 million recorded as contra-general and administrative expense, among other variances.\nStock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Total employee stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $14.5 million and $9.8 million, of which $8.0 million and $5.9 million was included in research and development expenses and $6.5 million and $3.9 million was included in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The increase for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value for the awards granted in 2020, offset in part by the reversal of previously recorded stock option expense due to a reduction in force in the third quarter of 2019 and an option modification expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2020, there was $4.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years, as compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At December 31, 2020, there was $10.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years, as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. Total stock-based compensation for options granted to non-employees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.2 million and $970,000, respectively.\nInterest Income\nThe $706,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to more interest earned on our higher balance of short-term investment holdings.\nInterest Expense\nThe $754,000 increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher interest expense recorded from our August 2019 Bonds and December 2019 Bonds, which were issued during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $75.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively. We determined that our August 2019 Bonds included an embedded conversion feature that was considered to be a derivative liability requiring bifurcation from the debt instrument and separate recognition in our financial statements. The conversion feature was revalued at the end of each reporting period and immediately prior to the conversion of the August 2019 Bonds in August 2020, with the resulting changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The derivative liability was derecognized upon the conversion in full of the August 2019 Bonds.\nGain (Loss) on Investment in Affiliated Entity\nThe gain (loss) on investment in affiliated entity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $36.6 million and $(3.1) million, respectively, resulting from the change in the fair market value of our investments in GeneOne and PLS. During the third quarter of 2020, we sold our full equity interest in GeneOne. We record our investment in PLS at its market value\nbased on the closing price of the shares on the Korea New Exchange Market at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNet Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale Equity Securities\nThe net unrealized gain on available-for-sale equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.7 million resulted from a change in the fair market value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2020.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Geneos\nThe gain recorded represents the excess of the fair value of our retained noncontrolling investment in Geneos and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest over the carrying amount of Geneos's assets and liabilities as of June 1, 2020, the date of deconsolidation.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Convertible Bonds\nUpon the full conversion of our August 2019 Bonds, a loss of $8.2 million was recorded for the difference between the fair value of the derivative liability immediately prior to its derecognition plus the carrying amount of the debt component, and the fair value of our common stock issued upon conversion.\nGain on Extinguishment of Convertible Senior Notes\nAs a result of the partial conversions of the Notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we recorded an $8.8 million gain on extinguishment calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the debt and the carrying value of the Notes as of the conversion dates.\nShare in Net Loss of Geneos\nThe share in net loss of Geneos represents our share of Geneos's losses during the period after deconsolidation.\nIncome Tax Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax benefit of $257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected our application of the intraperiod tax allocation rules under which we are required to record a tax benefit in continuing operations to offset the tax provision we recorded directly to other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains on our short-term investments.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes for any of the periods presented. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC. As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal, California and Pennsylvania income tax purposes of $566.2 million, $68.6 million and $75.3 million, respectively, net of the net operating losses that will expire due to IRC Section 382 limitations. We also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of $19.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to IRC Section 383 limitations. The net operating losses and credits began to expire during 2021.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consisted of revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements, including arrangements with affiliated entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our year over year total revenue decreased $26.4 million, or 87%. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time upfront payment of $23.0 million from ApolloBio during the second quarter of 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe $7.2 million decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to our collaboration with AstraZeneca of $2.9 million, a decrease in employee compensation expense of $2.6 million due to lower employee headcount and an increase in contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements of $2.4 million, as well as no sub-license fee expense in 2019 as compared to $1.9 million recorded in 2018 related to the ApolloBio collaboration. These decreases were offset by an increase in clinical trial related expenses of $3.5 million and the one-time personnel-related restructuring charge of approximately $1.9 million in connection with the employee termination costs incurred during the third quarter of 2019, among other variances.\nContributions received from current grant agreements and recorded as contra-research and development expense were $11.9 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase year over year was primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million earned from the CEPI grant, an increase of $1.9 million from the Bill & Melinda\nGates Foundation grant and an increase of $890,000 from the MCDC grant, offset in part by decreases of $1.1 million and $963,000 from various Wistar sub-grants and the DARPA Ebola grant, respectively, among other variances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $2.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to the $1.4 million of foreign non-income taxes withheld from the ApolloBio upfront payment we received in 2018 and the associated advisory fees of $960,000, among other variances.\nStock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Total employee stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $9.8 million and $10.2 million, of which $5.9 million and $5.9 million was included in research and development expenses and $3.9 million and $4.3 million was included in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The slight decrease for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense due to the reduction in our workforce in July 2019 and a lower weighted average grant date fair value for the awards granted in 2019, offset by an option modification expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2019, there was $3.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years, as compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At December 31, 2019, there was $4.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. Total stock-based compensation for options granted to non-employees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $970,000 and $302,000, respectively.\nInterest Income\nThe $341,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to the interest earned on our higher short-term investments holdings in 2019.\nInterest Expense\nThe interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.9 million primarily relates to our 6.5% convertible senior notes due 2024, or the Notes, which were issued during the first quarter of 2019, as well as our 1.0% convertible bonds due August 2024, or the August 2019 Bonds, which were issued during the third quarter of 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrants\nThe change in fair value of common stock warrants for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $361,000. The warrants were exercised during the quarter ended September 30, 2018, eliminating the associated fair value re-measurement in subsequent periods.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.8 million. We determined that our August 2019 Bonds included an embedded conversion feature that is considered to be a derivative liability requiring bifurcation from the debt instrument and separate recognition in our financial statements. The conversion option is revalued at each reporting period with the resulting changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss on Investment in Affiliated Entity\nThe loss on investment in affiliated entity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the fair market value of our investments in GeneOne and PLS. We record our investments in GeneOne and PLS at their market values based on the closing prices of those securities on the applicable stock exchange at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Tax Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax benefit of $257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected our application of the intraperiod tax allocation rules under which we are required to record a tax benefit in continuing operations to offset the tax provision we recorded directly to other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains on our short-term investments. The provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to foreign income taxes on the upfront payment received from ApolloBio in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes for any of the periods presented. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the IRC. As of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal, California and Pennsylvania income tax purposes of $483.3 million, $68.6 million and $80.5 million, respectively, net of the net operating losses that will expire due to IRC Section 382 limitations. We also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of $17.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to IRC Section 383 limitations. The net operating losses and credits began to expire during 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance research and development activities including clinical trial activities in the oncology, DNA vaccines and other immunotherapy areas of our business. Since inception, we have satisfied our cash requirements principally from proceeds from the sale of equity securities, indebtedness and grants and government contracts.\nWorking Capital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and short-term investments of $411.6 million and working capital of $429.5 million, as compared to $89.5 million and $62.2 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash and short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock under at-the-market, or ATM, sales agreements, offset by expenditures related to our research and development activities, clinical trials and various general and administrative expenses related to legal, consultants, accounting and audit, and corporate development.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $178.0 million consisted of net loss of $167.5 million less use of net cash in operating assets and liabilities of $71.1 million, partially offset by net non-cash adjustments of $60.6 million. The net cash used in operating activities included a $62.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily comprising prepayments for facilities, equipment and manufacturing related to INO-4800 and a $17.9 million increase in accounts receivable primarily from the DoD. The primary non-cash adjustments to net loss included the increase in fair value of derivative liability of $75.7 million prior to its derecognition, stock-based compensation of $15.6 million, share of net loss in Geneos of $4.6 million, interest expense of $4.1 million and depreciation and amortization of $3.6 million, offset by gain on investment in affiliated entities of $36.6 million and gain on deconsolidation of Geneos of $4.1 million, among other items.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $97.9 million consisted of net loss of $120.6 million less use of net cash in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 million, partially offset by net non-cash adjustments of $26.2 million. The primary non-cash expenses added back to net loss included stock-based compensation of $10.9 million, interest expense of $5.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.7 million and loss on investment in affiliated entities of $3.1 million and change in fair value of derivative liability of $1.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $58.8 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance was primarily the result of timing differences in short-term investment purchases, sales and maturities, offset by the proceeds from the sale of our investment in GeneOne of $40.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $465.3 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance was primarily due to the significantly higher net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM sales agreement as well as proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020, offset by the net proceeds received in 2019 from the issuance of Notes and August 2019 and December 2019 Bonds.\nIssuances of Notes and Bonds\nIn December 2019, we completed a private placement of our 1.0% convertible bonds due December 2024, or the December 2019 Bonds, to an institutional investor in Korea for an aggregate principal amount of 4.7 billion Korean Won (KRW) (approximately USD $4.1 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance). Net proceeds from the offering were $4.0 million, after deducting the offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we completed a private placement of aggregate principal amount of 18 billion Korean Won (KRW) (approximately USD $15.0 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance) of August 2019 Bonds issued to institutional investors led by Korea Investment Partners. Net proceeds from the offering were $14.5 million, after deducting the offering expenses payable by us. In August 2020, the August 2019 Bonds were fully converted into 4,692,364 shares of our common stock.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we completed a private placement of $78.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Net proceeds from the\noffering were $75.7 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses payable by us. During 2020, certain holders of the Notes converted principal amount of $62.1 million into an aggregate of 11,535,660 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $16.4 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.\nIssuances of Common Stock\nIn May 2018, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with an outside placement agent, or the Placement Agent, to sell shares of our common stock with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100.0 million, from time to time, through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which the Placement Agent would act as sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 3,340,678 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $9.1 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we entered into amendments to the Sales Agreement to increase the amount of our common stock that could be sold through the Placement Agent under the Sales Agreement to an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we sold 43,148,952 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $208.2 million. Following these sales, there was no remaining capacity under this Sales Agreement.\nOn April 3, 2020, we entered into a new sales agreement, or the New Sales Agreement, with the same Placement Agent to sell shares of our common stock. On that same day, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to the New Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $150.0 million. On May 12, 2020 we filed an additional prospectus supplement pursuant to the New Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of our common stock for an additional $100.0 million of gross proceeds, bringing the maximum gross proceeds of sales under the New Sales Agreement to $250.0 million. Through December 31, 2020, we sold 22,915,934 shares of common stock under the New Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $246.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was no remaining capacity under the New Sales Agreement.\nOn January 25, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 20,355,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.50 per share. The net proceeds, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, were $162.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, stock options to purchase 2,178,252 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $12.3 million, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $4.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, stock options to purchase 42,969 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $113,000, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $893,000. During the year ended December 31, 2018, stock options and warrants to purchase 756,853 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $2.4 million, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $612,000.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $906.2 million and we expect to continue to operate at a loss for some time. The amount of the accumulated deficit will continue to increase, as it will be expensive to continue research and development efforts. These activities will require additional financing. If these activities are successful and if we receive approval from the FDA to market our DNA vaccine and DNA immunotherapy product candidates, then we will need to raise additional funding to market and sell the approved products and equipment. We cannot predict the outcome of the above matters at this time. We are evaluating potential collaborations as an additional way to fund operations. We believe that our current cash and short-term investments are sufficient to meet our planned working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,149,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,134,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,948,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible bonds (2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,701,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,571,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,988,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,968,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,068,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,064,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,888,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts represent remaining contractual amounts due under our Notes, including interest based on the fixed rate of 6.5% per year. Although these Notes mature in March 2024, they may be converted into shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity would result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. During 2020, certain holders of the Notes converted principal amount of $62.1 million into an aggregate of 11,535,660 shares of our common stock. See Note 11, \"Convertible Debt\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report for further discussion.\n(2) Amounts represent contractual amounts due under our December 2019 Bonds, including interest based on the fixed rate of 1% per year plus a premium on such bonds to provide an internal rate of return with respect to such Bonds of 6% at maturity. Although these bonds mature in December 2024, they may be converted into equity securities prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. In August 2020, our August 2019 Bonds were fully converted into 4,962,364 shares of our common stock. See Note 11, \"Convertible Debt\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report for further discussion.\n(3) We have entered into operating leases for our facilities, which expire from 2023 to 2029, and operating leases for office equipment, which expire in 2021 and 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into two subleases for a portion of our Plymouth Meeting corporate headquarters facility through December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to receive aggregate future minimum lease payments totaling $1.2 million (non-discounted) over the duration of the sublease agreements, which expected payments are not included in the table above.\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on our business, consolidated results of operations or financial condition.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on our current expectations and projections, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We are under no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the filing of this Annual Report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including without limitation the disclosures made in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report under the Caption Risk Factors.\u201d\nRisk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: our history of losses; our lack of products that have received regulatory approval; uncertainties inherent in clinical trials and product development programs, including but not limited to the fact that pre-clinical and clinical results may not be indicative of results achievable in other trials or for other indications, that the studies or trials may not be successful or achieve desired results, that preclinical studies and clinical trials may not commence, have sufficient enrollment or be completed in the time periods anticipated, that results from one study may not necessarily be reflected or supported by the results of other similar studies, that results from an animal study may not be indicative of results achievable in human studies, that clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, that the outcome of any clinical trial is uncertain and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process, and that our electroporation technology and DNA vaccines may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits in clinical trials; the availability of funding; the ability to manufacture vaccine candidates; the availability or potential availability of alternative therapies or treatments for the conditions targeted by us or our collaborators, including alternatives that may be more efficacious or cost-effective than any therapy or treatment that we and our collaborators hope to develop; our ability to receive development, regulatory and commercialization event-based payments under our collaborative agreements; whether our proprietary rights are enforceable or defensible or infringe or allegedly infringe on rights of others or can withstand claims of invalidity; and the impact of government healthcare laws and proposals.\nOverview\nINOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on rapidly bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Our DNA medicines pipeline is comprised of three types of product candidates: DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies and DNA encoded monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs\u00ae). In clinical trials, we have demonstrated that DNA medicines can be delivered directly into cells in the body through our proprietary smart device to consistently activate robust and fully functional T cell and antibody responses against targeted pathogens and cancers.\nOur novel DNA medicine candidates are made using our proprietary SynCon\u00ae technology that uses a computer algorithm designed to identify and optimize the DNA sequence of the target antigen (be it virus or a tumor). INOVIO then creates optimized plasmids, which are circular strands of DNA that instruct a cell to produce antigens to help the person's immune system recognize and destroy cancerous or virally infected cells.\nOur patented CELLECTRA\u00ae smart delivery devices provide optimized uptake of our DNA medicines within the cell, overcoming a key limitation of other DNA-based technology approaches, namely cellular uptake.\nHuman clinical trial data to date has shown a favorable safety profile of our DNA medicines delivered directly into cells in the body using the CELLECTRA\u00ae smart device in more than 7,000 administrations across more than 3,000 patients.\nOur corporate strategy is to advance, protect and, once approved, commercialize our novel DNA medicines to meet urgent and emerging global health needs. We continue to advance and clinically validate an array of DNA medicine candidates that target HPV-associated diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). We aim to advance these candidates through commercialization and continue to leverage third-party resources through collaborations and partnerships, including product license agreements.\nOur partners and collaborators include ApolloBio Corp., AstraZeneca, Advaccine, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), GeneOne Life Science, HIV Vaccines Trial Network, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC), International Vaccine Institute (IVI), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Ology Bioservices, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Plumbline Life Sciences, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Richter-Helm BioLogics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, the University of Pennsylvania, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and The Wistar Institute.\nWe or our collaborators are currently conducting or planning clinical studies of our DNA medicines for HPV-associated precancers, including cervical, vulvar, and anal dysplasia; HPV-associated cancers, including head & neck, cervical, anal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal; other HPV-associated disorders, such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, or RRP; glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM; prostate cancer; HIV; Ebola; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS; Lassa fever; Zika virus; and the COVID-19 virus.\nAll of our product candidates are in the research and development phase. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate any such revenues for at least the next several years. We earn revenue from license fees and milestone revenue and collaborative research and development agreements. Our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing. All product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use, and will require significant costs for commercialization. We may not be successful in our research and development efforts, and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $906.2 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future due to our commitment to our research and development programs, the funding of preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of general and administrative activities.\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a number of significant impacts on our business during 2020. Most notably, in the United States, South Korea and China, we have accelerated the clinical development of INO-4800, our DNA vaccine candidate matched to the outbreak strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In January, we received initial grant funding from CEPI to advance INO-4800 into preclinical studies and clinical development through Phase 1 human testing. We had previously been awarded grants from CEPI for the development of other DNA vaccines against Lassa fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, which is also caused by a coronavirus like COVID-19. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States in April, and in June we reported positive interim data from the first two cohorts of the trial. In December 2020, we dosed the first subject in the Phase 2 segment of our Phase 2/3 clinical trial called INNOVATE (INovio INO-4800 Vaccine Trial for Efficacy). We have fully enrolled approximately 400 participants in the Phase 2 segment who are 18 years or older at 17 U.S. sites to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in order to confirm the dose(s) for the subsequent efficacy evaluation as part of the Phase 3 segment of the trial, once the FDA allows us to proceed. The Phase 3 segment of the INNOVATE remains on partial clinical hold until we satisfactorily resolve the FDA's remaining questions related to the CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 device that will be used to deliver INO-4800 into the cells of the skin. We plan to satisfy the remaining device questions during the conduct of Phase 2 segment and prior to the start of the Phase 3 segment of INNOVATE. In the Phase 3 segment of the trial, we intend to enroll healthy men and non-pregnant women 18 years and older, to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed dosing level(s) for each age group based on the data from the Phase 2 evaluation. Participants will be enrolled in a one-to-one randomization to receive either INO-4800 or a placebo. The Phase 3 segment will be case-driven with the final number of enrollees to be determined by the incidence of COVID-19 during the Phase 3 segment. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 segment will be virologically-confirmed COVID-19 disease.\nWe have also initiated clinical trials of INO-4800 in South Korea and China. In April, CEPI awarded us a grant of $6.9 million to work with International Vaccine Institute and the Korea National Institute of Health to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial, which was the first COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial approved in South Korea. In China, we are collaborating with Advaccine and have dosed 640 subjects with the first vaccination in a Phase 2 clinical trial in China. The Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China has enrolled both adults who are 18-59 years old and older adults (60 years and older) with the primary endpoints of evaluating safety and immunogenicity within the Chinese population.\nIn parallel with our accelerated clinical development efforts, we have engaged a network of partners for the planned large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800 if it achieves regulatory approval. In March, the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, awarded Ology Bioservices Inc. a contract to manufacture INO-4800 for the DoD to be used in upcoming clinical trials. In April, we entered into an agreement with the German contract manufacturer Richter-Helm BioLogics GmbH & Co. KG and expanded our preexisting manufacturing partnership to support large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800. In March, we also received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for accelerated testing and scale up of our CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP proprietary smart device for the intradermal delivery of INO-4800. In June, the DoD awarded us $71.1 million to support the large-scale manufacture of CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP, production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 devices that\nare used to deliver INO-4800 intradermally. In the second half of 2020, we added Thermo Fisher Scientific and Kaneka Eurogentec S.A., an affiliate of Kaneka Corporation, to our manufacturing consortium.\nOperationally, we have not experienced significant disruptions to date as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the outbreak, a number of governmental orders and other public health guidance measures were implemented across much of the United States, including in the locations of our offices, laboratories, clinical trial sites and third parties on whom we rely. We have implemented a work from home policy allowing employees who can work from home to do so, while those needing to work in laboratory facilities work in shifts to reduce the number of people gathered together at one time. Business travel has been suspended, and online and teleconference technology is used to meet virtually rather than in person. We have taken measures to secure our research and development project activities, while work in laboratories has been organized to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission.\nTo date, our liquidity has also not been negatively impacted by the pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised $454.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through our \"at-the-market\" equity offering program, which further enhanced our liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $411.6 million, compared to $89.5 million as of December 31, 2019. In addition, in January 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of $162.1 million.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, collaborators and service providers. The extent to which the pandemic will impact our business and operations will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including mass vaccination efforts, that are highly uncertain. For additional information on the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the Risk Factors\u201d section above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies include:\nCollaboration Agreements\nWe assess whether our collaboration agreements are subject to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 808: Collaborative Arrangements ( Topic 808\u201d) based on whether they involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of Topic 808, we assesses whether the payments between us and the collaboration partner are subject to other accounting literature. If payments from the collaboration partner to us represent consideration from a customer, then we account for those payments within the scope of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d). However, if we concludes that our collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities, such as for certain collaborative research and development activities, we present such payments as a reduction of research and development expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services agreed upon within each contract and assess whether each good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment of one or more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) product supply services; (iii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iv) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non-refundable, upfront fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment of management to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligation. The standalone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied at a point in time or over time. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.\nLicense Fees\nIf a license to intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nProduct Supply Services\nArrangements that include a promise for future supply of drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the licensee's discretion are generally considered as options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. We evaluate whether we are the principal or agent in the arrangement. We have determined that we are the principal in current arrangements as we control the product supply before it is transferred to the customer.\nMilestone Payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achieving such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our collaborative arrangements.\nGrants\nWe account for various grant agreements under the contributions guidance under Subtopic 958-605, Not-for-Profit Entities-Revenue Recognition, which is outside the scope of Topic 606, as the government agencies granting us funds are not receiving reciprocal value for their contributions. All contributions received from current grant agreements are recorded as a contra-expense as opposed to revenue on the consolidated statement of operations.\nLeases\nFor our long-term operating leases, we recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The lease liability is determined as the present value of future lease payments using an estimated rate of interest that we would pay to borrow equivalent funds on a collateralized basis at the lease commencement\ndate. The right-of-use asset is based on the liability adjusted for any prepaid or deferred rent. We determined the lease term at the commencement date by considering whether renewal options and termination options are reasonably assured of exercise.\nFixed rent expense for our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Variable lease payments including lease operating expenses are recorded as incurred.\nDerivative Liabilities\nWe evaluate our debt and equity issuances to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in our financial statements. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. In circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur activities have largely consisted of research and development efforts related to developing electroporation delivery technologies and DNA immunotherapies and vaccines. Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities and other overhead expenses, clinical trials, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred. These expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations and licensing arrangements. We review and accrue clinical trial expense based on work performed, relying on estimates of total trial management costs, sites activated, patients enrolled, and number of patient visits. We follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a research agreement or clinical trial can be made. Accrued clinical trial costs are subject to revisions as trials progress. Revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Historically, revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development expense; however a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table and the results of these periods are used in the discussion thereafter.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2019\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consisted of revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements, including arrangements with affiliated entities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our year over year total revenue increased $3.3 million, or 80%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue earned from Advaccine and the milestone revenue earned from our affiliated entity Plumbline Life Sciences, Inc., or PLS, offset by a decrease in revenue recognized from our collaboration with AstraZeneca.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe $6.2 million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher drug manufacturing expenses and outside services related to our INO-4800 clinical trials of $17.1 million, an increase in engineering services related to our CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP device development and array automation project of $12.4 million, higher expensed device materials of $5.0 million, higher contract labor expense of $2.4 million, higher employee stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million, higher drug manufacturing expenses related to our Wistar IPCAVD grant of $1.2 million and an increase in patent maintenance and milestone fees to Wistar of $1.1 million. These increases were offset by an increase in contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements of $33.5 million, among other variances.\nContributions received from current grant agreements and recorded as contra-research and development expense were $45.4 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase year over year was primarily due to increases of $21.2 million, $10.0 million and $4.1 million earned under grants from the DoD, CEPI and Gates, respectively, related to INO-4800 and device development activities, partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million earned from the Gates grant and Wistar sub-grant related to our dMAb technology, among other variances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $10.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily related to an increase in legal expenses of $5.2 million, an increase in expenses for work performed related to corporate marketing and communications of $3.1 million and higher employee and consultant stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million, partially offset by a gain on foreign exchange of $2.2 million recorded as contra-general and administrative expense, among other variances.\nStock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Total employee stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $14.5 million and $9.8 million, of which $8.0 million and $5.9 million was included in research and development expenses and $6.5 million and $3.9 million was included in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The increase for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value for the awards granted in 2020, offset in part by the reversal of previously recorded stock option expense due to a reduction in force in the third quarter of 2019 and an option modification expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2020, there was $4.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years, as compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At December 31, 2020, there was $10.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years, as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. Total stock-based compensation for options granted to non-employees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.2 million and $970,000, respectively.\nInterest Income\nThe $706,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to more interest earned on our higher balance of short-term investment holdings.\nInterest Expense\nThe $754,000 increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher interest expense recorded from our August 2019 Bonds and December 2019 Bonds, which were issued during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $75.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively. We determined that our August 2019 Bonds included an embedded conversion feature that was considered to be a derivative liability requiring bifurcation from the debt instrument and separate recognition in our financial statements. The conversion feature was revalued at the end of each reporting period and immediately prior to the conversion of the August 2019 Bonds in August 2020, with the resulting changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The derivative liability was derecognized upon the conversion in full of the August 2019 Bonds.\nGain (Loss) on Investment in Affiliated Entity\nThe gain (loss) on investment in affiliated entity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $36.6 million and $(3.1) million, respectively, resulting from the change in the fair market value of our investments in GeneOne and PLS. During the third quarter of 2020, we sold our full equity interest in GeneOne. We record our investment in PLS at its market value\nbased on the closing price of the shares on the Korea New Exchange Market at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNet Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale Equity Securities\nThe net unrealized gain on available-for-sale equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.7 million resulted from a change in the fair market value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2020.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Geneos\nThe gain recorded represents the excess of the fair value of our retained noncontrolling investment in Geneos and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest over the carrying amount of Geneos's assets and liabilities as of June 1, 2020, the date of deconsolidation.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Convertible Bonds\nUpon the full conversion of our August 2019 Bonds, a loss of $8.2 million was recorded for the difference between the fair value of the derivative liability immediately prior to its derecognition plus the carrying amount of the debt component, and the fair value of our common stock issued upon conversion.\nGain on Extinguishment of Convertible Senior Notes\nAs a result of the partial conversions of the Notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we recorded an $8.8 million gain on extinguishment calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the debt and the carrying value of the Notes as of the conversion dates.\nShare in Net Loss of Geneos\nThe share in net loss of Geneos represents our share of Geneos's losses during the period after deconsolidation.\nIncome Tax Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax benefit of $257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected our application of the intraperiod tax allocation rules under which we are required to record a tax benefit in continuing operations to offset the tax provision we recorded directly to other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains on our short-term investments.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes for any of the periods presented. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC. As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal, California and Pennsylvania income tax purposes of $566.2 million, $68.6 million and $75.3 million, respectively, net of the net operating losses that will expire due to IRC Section 382 limitations. We also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of $19.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to IRC Section 383 limitations. The net operating losses and credits began to expire during 2021.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n \nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consisted of revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements, including arrangements with affiliated entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our year over year total revenue decreased $26.4 million, or 87%. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time upfront payment of $23.0 million from ApolloBio during the second quarter of 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe $7.2 million decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to our collaboration with AstraZeneca of $2.9 million, a decrease in employee compensation expense of $2.6 million due to lower employee headcount and an increase in contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements of $2.4 million, as well as no sub-license fee expense in 2019 as compared to $1.9 million recorded in 2018 related to the ApolloBio collaboration. These decreases were offset by an increase in clinical trial related expenses of $3.5 million and the one-time personnel-related restructuring charge of approximately $1.9 million in connection with the employee termination costs incurred during the third quarter of 2019, among other variances.\nContributions received from current grant agreements and recorded as contra-research and development expense were $11.9 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase year over year was primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million earned from the CEPI grant, an increase of $1.9 million from the Bill & Melinda\nGates Foundation grant and an increase of $890,000 from the MCDC grant, offset in part by decreases of $1.1 million and $963,000 from various Wistar sub-grants and the DARPA Ebola grant, respectively, among other variances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $2.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to the $1.4 million of foreign non-income taxes withheld from the ApolloBio upfront payment we received in 2018 and the associated advisory fees of $960,000, among other variances.\nStock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Total employee stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $9.8 million and $10.2 million, of which $5.9 million and $5.9 million was included in research and development expenses and $3.9 million and $4.3 million was included in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The slight decrease for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense due to the reduction in our workforce in July 2019 and a lower weighted average grant date fair value for the awards granted in 2019, offset by an option modification expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2019, there was $3.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years, as compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At December 31, 2019, there was $4.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. Total stock-based compensation for options granted to non-employees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $970,000 and $302,000, respectively.\nInterest Income\nThe $341,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to the interest earned on our higher short-term investments holdings in 2019.\nInterest Expense\nThe interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.9 million primarily relates to our 6.5% convertible senior notes due 2024, or the Notes, which were issued during the first quarter of 2019, as well as our 1.0% convertible bonds due August 2024, or the August 2019 Bonds, which were issued during the third quarter of 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrants\nThe change in fair value of common stock warrants for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $361,000. The warrants were exercised during the quarter ended September 30, 2018, eliminating the associated fair value re-measurement in subsequent periods.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.8 million. We determined that our August 2019 Bonds included an embedded conversion feature that is considered to be a derivative liability requiring bifurcation from the debt instrument and separate recognition in our financial statements. The conversion option is revalued at each reporting period with the resulting changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss on Investment in Affiliated Entity\nThe loss on investment in affiliated entity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the fair market value of our investments in GeneOne and PLS. We record our investments in GeneOne and PLS at their market values based on the closing prices of those securities on the applicable stock exchange at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Tax Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax benefit of $257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected our application of the intraperiod tax allocation rules under which we are required to record a tax benefit in continuing operations to offset the tax provision we recorded directly to other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains on our short-term investments. The provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to foreign income taxes on the upfront payment received from ApolloBio in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes for any of the periods presented. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the IRC. As of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal, California and Pennsylvania income tax purposes of $483.3 million, $68.6 million and $80.5 million, respectively, net of the net operating losses that will expire due to IRC Section 382 limitations. We also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of $17.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to IRC Section 383 limitations. The net operating losses and credits began to expire during 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance research and development activities including clinical trial activities in the oncology, DNA vaccines and other immunotherapy areas of our business. Since inception, we have satisfied our cash requirements principally from proceeds from the sale of equity securities, indebtedness and grants and government contracts.\nWorking Capital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and short-term investments of $411.6 million and working capital of $429.5 million, as compared to $89.5 million and $62.2 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash and short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock under at-the-market, or ATM, sales agreements, offset by expenditures related to our research and development activities, clinical trials and various general and administrative expenses related to legal, consultants, accounting and audit, and corporate development.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $178.0 million consisted of net loss of $167.5 million less use of net cash in operating assets and liabilities of $71.1 million, partially offset by net non-cash adjustments of $60.6 million. The net cash used in operating activities included a $62.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily comprising prepayments for facilities, equipment and manufacturing related to INO-4800 and a $17.9 million increase in accounts receivable primarily from the DoD. The primary non-cash adjustments to net loss included the increase in fair value of derivative liability of $75.7 million prior to its derecognition, stock-based compensation of $15.6 million, share of net loss in Geneos of $4.6 million, interest expense of $4.1 million and depreciation and amortization of $3.6 million, offset by gain on investment in affiliated entities of $36.6 million and gain on deconsolidation of Geneos of $4.1 million, among other items.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $97.9 million consisted of net loss of $120.6 million less use of net cash in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 million, partially offset by net non-cash adjustments of $26.2 million. The primary non-cash expenses added back to net loss included stock-based compensation of $10.9 million, interest expense of $5.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.7 million and loss on investment in affiliated entities of $3.1 million and change in fair value of derivative liability of $1.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $58.8 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance was primarily the result of timing differences in short-term investment purchases, sales and maturities, offset by the proceeds from the sale of our investment in GeneOne of $40.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $465.3 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance was primarily due to the significantly higher net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM sales agreement as well as proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020, offset by the net proceeds received in 2019 from the issuance of Notes and August 2019 and December 2019 Bonds.\nIssuances of Notes and Bonds\nIn December 2019, we completed a private placement of our 1.0% convertible bonds due December 2024, or the December 2019 Bonds, to an institutional investor in Korea for an aggregate principal amount of 4.7 billion Korean Won (KRW) (approximately USD $4.1 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance). Net proceeds from the offering were $4.0 million, after deducting the offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we completed a private placement of aggregate principal amount of 18 billion Korean Won (KRW) (approximately USD $15.0 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance) of August 2019 Bonds issued to institutional investors led by Korea Investment Partners. Net proceeds from the offering were $14.5 million, after deducting the offering expenses payable by us. In August 2020, the August 2019 Bonds were fully converted into 4,692,364 shares of our common stock.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we completed a private placement of $78.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Net proceeds from the\noffering were $75.7 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses payable by us. During 2020, certain holders of the Notes converted principal amount of $62.1 million into an aggregate of 11,535,660 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $16.4 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.\nIssuances of Common Stock\nIn May 2018, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with an outside placement agent, or the Placement Agent, to sell shares of our common stock with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100.0 million, from time to time, through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which the Placement Agent would act as sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 3,340,678 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $9.1 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we entered into amendments to the Sales Agreement to increase the amount of our common stock that could be sold through the Placement Agent under the Sales Agreement to an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we sold 43,148,952 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $208.2 million. Following these sales, there was no remaining capacity under this Sales Agreement.\nOn April 3, 2020, we entered into a new sales agreement, or the New Sales Agreement, with the same Placement Agent to sell shares of our common stock. On that same day, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to the New Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $150.0 million. On May 12, 2020 we filed an additional prospectus supplement pursuant to the New Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of our common stock for an additional $100.0 million of gross proceeds, bringing the maximum gross proceeds of sales under the New Sales Agreement to $250.0 million. Through December 31, 2020, we sold 22,915,934 shares of common stock under the New Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $246.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was no remaining capacity under the New Sales Agreement.\nOn January 25, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 20,355,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.50 per share. The net proceeds, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, were $162.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, stock options to purchase 2,178,252 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $12.3 million, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $4.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, stock options to purchase 42,969 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $113,000, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $893,000. During the year ended December 31, 2018, stock options and warrants to purchase 756,853 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $2.4 million, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $612,000.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $906.2 million and we expect to continue to operate at a loss for some time. The amount of the accumulated deficit will continue to increase, as it will be expensive to continue research and development efforts. These activities will require additional financing. If these activities are successful and if we receive approval from the FDA to market our DNA vaccine and DNA immunotherapy product candidates, then we will need to raise additional funding to market and sell the approved products and equipment. We cannot predict the outcome of the above matters at this time. We are evaluating potential collaborations as an additional way to fund operations. We believe that our current cash and short-term investments are sufficient to meet our planned working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,149,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,134,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,948,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible bonds (2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,701,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,571,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,988,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,968,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,068,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,064,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,888,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts represent remaining contractual amounts due under our Notes, including interest based on the fixed rate of 6.5% per year. Although these Notes mature in March 2024, they may be converted into shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity would result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. During 2020, certain holders of the Notes converted principal amount of $62.1 million into an aggregate of 11,535,660 shares of our common stock. See Note 11, \"Convertible Debt\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report for further discussion.\n(2) Amounts represent contractual amounts due under our December 2019 Bonds, including interest based on the fixed rate of 1% per year plus a premium on such bonds to provide an internal rate of return with respect to such Bonds of 6% at maturity. Although these bonds mature in December 2024, they may be converted into equity securities prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. In August 2020, our August 2019 Bonds were fully converted into 4,962,364 shares of our common stock. See Note 11, \"Convertible Debt\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report for further discussion.\n(3) We have entered into operating leases for our facilities, which expire from 2023 to 2029, and operating leases for office equipment, which expire in 2021 and 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into two subleases for a portion of our Plymouth Meeting corporate headquarters facility through December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to receive aggregate future minimum lease payments totaling $1.2 million (non-discounted) over the duration of the sublease agreements, which expected payments are not included in the table above.\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on our business, consolidated results of operations or financial condition.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on our current expectations and projections, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We are under no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the filing of this Annual Report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including without limitation the disclosures made in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report under the Caption Risk Factors.\u201d\nRisk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: our history of losses; our lack of products that have received regulatory approval; uncertainties inherent in clinical trials and product development programs, including but not limited to the fact that pre-clinical and clinical results may not be indicative of results achievable in other trials or for other indications, that the studies or trials may not be successful or achieve desired results, that preclinical studies and clinical trials may not commence, have sufficient enrollment or be completed in the time periods anticipated, that results from one study may not necessarily be reflected or supported by the results of other similar studies, that results from an animal study may not be indicative of results achievable in human studies, that clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, that the outcome of any clinical trial is uncertain and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process, and that our electroporation technology and DNA vaccines may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits in clinical trials; the availability of funding; the ability to manufacture vaccine candidates; the availability or potential availability of alternative therapies or treatments for the conditions targeted by us or our collaborators, including alternatives that may be more efficacious or cost-effective than any therapy or treatment that we and our collaborators hope to develop; our ability to receive development, regulatory and commercialization event-based payments under our collaborative agreements; whether our proprietary rights are enforceable or defensible or infringe or allegedly infringe on rights of others or can withstand claims of invalidity; and the impact of government healthcare laws and proposals.\nOverview\nINOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on rapidly bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Our DNA medicines pipeline is comprised of three types of product candidates: DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies and DNA encoded monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs\u00ae). In clinical trials, we have demonstrated that DNA medicines can be delivered directly into cells in the body through our proprietary smart device to consistently activate robust and fully functional T cell and antibody responses against targeted pathogens and cancers.\nOur novel DNA medicine candidates are made using our proprietary SynCon\u00ae technology that uses a computer algorithm designed to identify and optimize the DNA sequence of the target antigen (be it virus or a tumor). INOVIO then creates optimized plasmids, which are circular strands of DNA that instruct a cell to produce antigens to help the person's immune system recognize and destroy cancerous or virally infected cells.\nOur patented CELLECTRA\u00ae smart delivery devices provide optimized uptake of our DNA medicines within the cell, overcoming a key limitation of other DNA-based technology approaches, namely cellular uptake.\nHuman clinical trial data to date has shown a favorable safety profile of our DNA medicines delivered directly into cells in the body using the CELLECTRA\u00ae smart device in more than 7,000 administrations across more than 3,000 patients.\nOur corporate strategy is to advance, protect and, once approved, commercialize our novel DNA medicines to meet urgent and emerging global health needs. We continue to advance and clinically validate an array of DNA medicine candidates that target HPV-associated diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). We aim to advance these candidates through commercialization and continue to leverage third-party resources through collaborations and partnerships, including product license agreements.\nOur partners and collaborators include ApolloBio Corp., AstraZeneca, Advaccine, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), GeneOne Life Science, HIV Vaccines Trial Network, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC), International Vaccine Institute (IVI), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Ology Bioservices, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Plumbline Life Sciences, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Richter-Helm BioLogics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, the University of Pennsylvania, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and The Wistar Institute.\nWe or our collaborators are currently conducting or planning clinical studies of our DNA medicines for HPV-associated precancers, including cervical, vulvar, and anal dysplasia; HPV-associated cancers, including head & neck, cervical, anal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal; other HPV-associated disorders, such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, or RRP; glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM; prostate cancer; HIV; Ebola; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS; Lassa fever; Zika virus; and the COVID-19 virus.\nAll of our product candidates are in the research and development phase. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate any such revenues for at least the next several years. We earn revenue from license fees and milestone revenue and collaborative research and development agreements. Our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing. All product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use, and will require significant costs for commercialization. We may not be successful in our research and development efforts, and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $906.2 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future due to our commitment to our research and development programs, the funding of preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of general and administrative activities.\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a number of significant impacts on our business during 2020. Most notably, in the United States, South Korea and China, we have accelerated the clinical development of INO-4800, our DNA vaccine candidate matched to the outbreak strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In January, we received initial grant funding from CEPI to advance INO-4800 into preclinical studies and clinical development through Phase 1 human testing. We had previously been awarded grants from CEPI for the development of other DNA vaccines against Lassa fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, which is also caused by a coronavirus like COVID-19. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States in April, and in June we reported positive interim data from the first two cohorts of the trial. In December 2020, we dosed the first subject in the Phase 2 segment of our Phase 2/3 clinical trial called INNOVATE (INovio INO-4800 Vaccine Trial for Efficacy). We have fully enrolled approximately 400 participants in the Phase 2 segment who are 18 years or older at 17 U.S. sites to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in order to confirm the dose(s) for the subsequent efficacy evaluation as part of the Phase 3 segment of the trial, once the FDA allows us to proceed. The Phase 3 segment of the INNOVATE remains on partial clinical hold until we satisfactorily resolve the FDA's remaining questions related to the CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 device that will be used to deliver INO-4800 into the cells of the skin. We plan to satisfy the remaining device questions during the conduct of Phase 2 segment and prior to the start of the Phase 3 segment of INNOVATE. In the Phase 3 segment of the trial, we intend to enroll healthy men and non-pregnant women 18 years and older, to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed dosing level(s) for each age group based on the data from the Phase 2 evaluation. Participants will be enrolled in a one-to-one randomization to receive either INO-4800 or a placebo. The Phase 3 segment will be case-driven with the final number of enrollees to be determined by the incidence of COVID-19 during the Phase 3 segment. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 segment will be virologically-confirmed COVID-19 disease.\nWe have also initiated clinical trials of INO-4800 in South Korea and China. In April, CEPI awarded us a grant of $6.9 million to work with International Vaccine Institute and the Korea National Institute of Health to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial, which was the first COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial approved in South Korea. In China, we are collaborating with Advaccine and have dosed 640 subjects with the first vaccination in a Phase 2 clinical trial in China. The Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China has enrolled both adults who are 18-59 years old and older adults (60 years and older) with the primary endpoints of evaluating safety and immunogenicity within the Chinese population.\nIn parallel with our accelerated clinical development efforts, we have engaged a network of partners for the planned large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800 if it achieves regulatory approval. In March, the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, awarded Ology Bioservices Inc. a contract to manufacture INO-4800 for the DoD to be used in upcoming clinical trials. In April, we entered into an agreement with the German contract manufacturer Richter-Helm BioLogics GmbH & Co. KG and expanded our preexisting manufacturing partnership to support large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800. In March, we also received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for accelerated testing and scale up of our CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP proprietary smart device for the intradermal delivery of INO-4800. In June, the DoD awarded us $71.1 million to support the large-scale manufacture of CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP, production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA\u00ae 2000 devices that\nare used to deliver INO-4800 intradermally. In the second half of 2020, we added Thermo Fisher Scientific and Kaneka Eurogentec S.A., an affiliate of Kaneka Corporation, to our manufacturing consortium.\nOperationally, we have not experienced significant disruptions to date as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the outbreak, a number of governmental orders and other public health guidance measures were implemented across much of the United States, including in the locations of our offices, laboratories, clinical trial sites and third parties on whom we rely. We have implemented a work from home policy allowing employees who can work from home to do so, while those needing to work in laboratory facilities work in shifts to reduce the number of people gathered together at one time. Business travel has been suspended, and online and teleconference technology is used to meet virtually rather than in person. We have taken measures to secure our research and development project activities, while work in laboratories has been organized to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission.\nTo date, our liquidity has also not been negatively impacted by the pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised $454.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through our \"at-the-market\" equity offering program, which further enhanced our liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $411.6 million, compared to $89.5 million as of December 31, 2019. In addition, in January 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of $162.1 million.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, collaborators and service providers. The extent to which the pandemic will impact our business and operations will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including mass vaccination efforts, that are highly uncertain. For additional information on the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the Risk Factors\u201d section above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies include:\nCollaboration Agreements\nWe assess whether our collaboration agreements are subject to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 808: Collaborative Arrangements ( Topic 808\u201d) based on whether they involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of Topic 808, we assesses whether the payments between us and the collaboration partner are subject to other accounting literature. If payments from the collaboration partner to us represent consideration from a customer, then we account for those payments within the scope of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d). However, if we concludes that our collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities, such as for certain collaborative research and development activities, we present such payments as a reduction of research and development expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services agreed upon within each contract and assess whether each good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment of one or more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) product supply services; (iii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iv) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non-refundable, upfront fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment of management to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligation. The standalone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied at a point in time or over time. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.\nLicense Fees\nIf a license to intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nProduct Supply Services\nArrangements that include a promise for future supply of drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the licensee's discretion are generally considered as options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. We evaluate whether we are the principal or agent in the arrangement. We have determined that we are the principal in current arrangements as we control the product supply before it is transferred to the customer.\nMilestone Payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achieving such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our collaborative arrangements.\nGrants\nWe account for various grant agreements under the contributions guidance under Subtopic 958-605, Not-for-Profit Entities-Revenue Recognition, which is outside the scope of Topic 606, as the government agencies granting us funds are not receiving reciprocal value for their contributions. All contributions received from current grant agreements are recorded as a contra-expense as opposed to revenue on the consolidated statement of operations.\nLeases\nFor our long-term operating leases, we recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The lease liability is determined as the present value of future lease payments using an estimated rate of interest that we would pay to borrow equivalent funds on a collateralized basis at the lease commencement\ndate. The right-of-use asset is based on the liability adjusted for any prepaid or deferred rent. We determined the lease term at the commencement date by considering whether renewal options and termination options are reasonably assured of exercise.\nFixed rent expense for our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Variable lease payments including lease operating expenses are recorded as incurred.\nDerivative Liabilities\nWe evaluate our debt and equity issuances to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in our financial statements. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. In circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur activities have largely consisted of research and development efforts related to developing electroporation delivery technologies and DNA immunotherapies and vaccines. Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities and other overhead expenses, clinical trials, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred. These expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations and licensing arrangements. We review and accrue clinical trial expense based on work performed, relying on estimates of total trial management costs, sites activated, patients enrolled, and number of patient visits. We follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a research agreement or clinical trial can be made. Accrued clinical trial costs are subject to revisions as trials progress. Revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Historically, revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development expense; however a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table and the results of these periods are used in the discussion thereafter.\n\n*Not meaningful\n \nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consisted of revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements, including arrangements with affiliated entities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our year over year total revenue increased $3.3 million, or 80%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue earned from Advaccine and the milestone revenue earned from our affiliated entity Plumbline Life Sciences, Inc., or PLS, offset by a decrease in revenue recognized from our collaboration with AstraZeneca.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe $6.2 million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher drug manufacturing expenses and outside services related to our INO-4800 clinical trials of $17.1 million, an increase in engineering services related to our CELLECTRA\u00ae 3PSP device development and array automation project of $12.4 million, higher expensed device materials of $5.0 million, higher contract labor expense of $2.4 million, higher employee stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million, higher drug manufacturing expenses related to our Wistar IPCAVD grant of $1.2 million and an increase in patent maintenance and milestone fees to Wistar of $1.1 million. These increases were offset by an increase in contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements of $33.5 million, among other variances.\nContributions received from current grant agreements and recorded as contra-research and development expense were $45.4 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase year over year was primarily due to increases of $21.2 million, $10.0 million and $4.1 million earned under grants from the DoD, CEPI and Gates, respectively, related to INO-4800 and device development activities, partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million earned from the Gates grant and Wistar sub-grant related to our dMAb technology, among other variances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $10.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily related to an increase in legal expenses of $5.2 million, an increase in expenses for work performed related to corporate marketing and communications of $3.1 million and higher employee and consultant stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million, partially offset by a gain on foreign exchange of $2.2 million recorded as contra-general and administrative expense, among other variances.\nStock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Total employee stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $14.5 million and $9.8 million, of which $8.0 million and $5.9 million was included in research and development expenses and $6.5 million and $3.9 million was included in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The increase for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value for the awards granted in 2020, offset in part by the reversal of previously recorded stock option expense due to a reduction in force in the third quarter of 2019 and an option modification expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2020, there was $4.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years, as compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At December 31, 2020, there was $10.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years, as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. Total stock-based compensation for options granted to non-employees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.2 million and $970,000, respectively.\nInterest Income\nThe $706,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to more interest earned on our higher balance of short-term investment holdings.\nInterest Expense\nThe $754,000 increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher interest expense recorded from our August 2019 Bonds and December 2019 Bonds, which were issued during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $75.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively. We determined that our August 2019 Bonds included an embedded conversion feature that was considered to be a derivative liability requiring bifurcation from the debt instrument and separate recognition in our financial statements. The conversion feature was revalued at the end of each reporting period and immediately prior to the conversion of the August 2019 Bonds in August 2020, with the resulting changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The derivative liability was derecognized upon the conversion in full of the August 2019 Bonds.\nGain (Loss) on Investment in Affiliated Entity\nThe gain (loss) on investment in affiliated entity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $36.6 million and $(3.1) million, respectively, resulting from the change in the fair market value of our investments in GeneOne and PLS. During the third quarter of 2020, we sold our full equity interest in GeneOne. We record our investment in PLS at its market value\nbased on the closing price of the shares on the Korea New Exchange Market at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNet Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale Equity Securities\nThe net unrealized gain on available-for-sale equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.7 million resulted from a change in the fair market value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2020.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Geneos\nThe gain recorded represents the excess of the fair value of our retained noncontrolling investment in Geneos and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest over the carrying amount of Geneos's assets and liabilities as of June 1, 2020, the date of deconsolidation.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Convertible Bonds\nUpon the full conversion of our August 2019 Bonds, a loss of $8.2 million was recorded for the difference between the fair value of the derivative liability immediately prior to its derecognition plus the carrying amount of the debt component, and the fair value of our common stock issued upon conversion.\nGain on Extinguishment of Convertible Senior Notes\nAs a result of the partial conversions of the Notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we recorded an $8.8 million gain on extinguishment calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the debt and the carrying value of the Notes as of the conversion dates.\nShare in Net Loss of Geneos\nThe share in net loss of Geneos represents our share of Geneos's losses during the period after deconsolidation.\nIncome Tax Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax benefit of $257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected our application of the intraperiod tax allocation rules under which we are required to record a tax benefit in continuing operations to offset the tax provision we recorded directly to other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains on our short-term investments.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes for any of the periods presented. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC. As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal, California and Pennsylvania income tax purposes of $566.2 million, $68.6 million and $75.3 million, respectively, net of the net operating losses that will expire due to IRC Section 382 limitations. We also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of $19.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to IRC Section 383 limitations. The net operating losses and credits began to expire during 2021.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n \nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consisted of revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements, including arrangements with affiliated entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our year over year total revenue decreased $26.4 million, or 87%. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time upfront payment of $23.0 million from ApolloBio during the second quarter of 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe $7.2 million decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to our collaboration with AstraZeneca of $2.9 million, a decrease in employee compensation expense of $2.6 million due to lower employee headcount and an increase in contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements of $2.4 million, as well as no sub-license fee expense in 2019 as compared to $1.9 million recorded in 2018 related to the ApolloBio collaboration. These decreases were offset by an increase in clinical trial related expenses of $3.5 million and the one-time personnel-related restructuring charge of approximately $1.9 million in connection with the employee termination costs incurred during the third quarter of 2019, among other variances.\nContributions received from current grant agreements and recorded as contra-research and development expense were $11.9 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase year over year was primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million earned from the CEPI grant, an increase of $1.9 million from the Bill & Melinda\nGates Foundation grant and an increase of $890,000 from the MCDC grant, offset in part by decreases of $1.1 million and $963,000 from various Wistar sub-grants and the DARPA Ebola grant, respectively, among other variances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $2.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to the $1.4 million of foreign non-income taxes withheld from the ApolloBio upfront payment we received in 2018 and the associated advisory fees of $960,000, among other variances.\nStock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Total employee stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $9.8 million and $10.2 million, of which $5.9 million and $5.9 million was included in research and development expenses and $3.9 million and $4.3 million was included in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The slight decrease for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense due to the reduction in our workforce in July 2019 and a lower weighted average grant date fair value for the awards granted in 2019, offset by an option modification expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2019, there was $3.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years, as compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At December 31, 2019, there was $4.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. Total stock-based compensation for options granted to non-employees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $970,000 and $302,000, respectively.\nInterest Income\nThe $341,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to the interest earned on our higher short-term investments holdings in 2019.\nInterest Expense\nThe interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.9 million primarily relates to our 6.5% convertible senior notes due 2024, or the Notes, which were issued during the first quarter of 2019, as well as our 1.0% convertible bonds due August 2024, or the August 2019 Bonds, which were issued during the third quarter of 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrants\nThe change in fair value of common stock warrants for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $361,000. The warrants were exercised during the quarter ended September 30, 2018, eliminating the associated fair value re-measurement in subsequent periods.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.8 million. We determined that our August 2019 Bonds included an embedded conversion feature that is considered to be a derivative liability requiring bifurcation from the debt instrument and separate recognition in our financial statements. The conversion option is revalued at each reporting period with the resulting changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss on Investment in Affiliated Entity\nThe loss on investment in affiliated entity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the fair market value of our investments in GeneOne and PLS. We record our investments in GeneOne and PLS at their market values based on the closing prices of those securities on the applicable stock exchange at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Tax Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax benefit of $257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected our application of the intraperiod tax allocation rules under which we are required to record a tax benefit in continuing operations to offset the tax provision we recorded directly to other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains on our short-term investments. The provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to foreign income taxes on the upfront payment received from ApolloBio in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes for any of the periods presented. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the IRC. As of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal, California and Pennsylvania income tax purposes of $483.3 million, $68.6 million and $80.5 million, respectively, net of the net operating losses that will expire due to IRC Section 382 limitations. We also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of $17.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to IRC Section 383 limitations. The net operating losses and credits began to expire during 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance research and development activities including clinical trial activities in the oncology, DNA vaccines and other immunotherapy areas of our business. Since inception, we have satisfied our cash requirements principally from proceeds from the sale of equity securities, indebtedness and grants and government contracts.\nWorking Capital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and short-term investments of $411.6 million and working capital of $429.5 million, as compared to $89.5 million and $62.2 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash and short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock under at-the-market, or ATM, sales agreements, offset by expenditures related to our research and development activities, clinical trials and various general and administrative expenses related to legal, consultants, accounting and audit, and corporate development.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $178.0 million consisted of net loss of $167.5 million less use of net cash in operating assets and liabilities of $71.1 million, partially offset by net non-cash adjustments of $60.6 million. The net cash used in operating activities included a $62.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily comprising prepayments for facilities, equipment and manufacturing related to INO-4800 and a $17.9 million increase in accounts receivable primarily from the DoD. The primary non-cash adjustments to net loss included the increase in fair value of derivative liability of $75.7 million prior to its derecognition, stock-based compensation of $15.6 million, share of net loss in Geneos of $4.6 million, interest expense of $4.1 million and depreciation and amortization of $3.6 million, offset by gain on investment in affiliated entities of $36.6 million and gain on deconsolidation of Geneos of $4.1 million, among other items.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $97.9 million consisted of net loss of $120.6 million less use of net cash in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 million, partially offset by net non-cash adjustments of $26.2 million. The primary non-cash expenses added back to net loss included stock-based compensation of $10.9 million, interest expense of $5.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.7 million and loss on investment in affiliated entities of $3.1 million and change in fair value of derivative liability of $1.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $58.8 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance was primarily the result of timing differences in short-term investment purchases, sales and maturities, offset by the proceeds from the sale of our investment in GeneOne of $40.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $465.3 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance was primarily due to the significantly higher net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM sales agreement as well as proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020, offset by the net proceeds received in 2019 from the issuance of Notes and August 2019 and December 2019 Bonds.\nIssuances of Notes and Bonds\nIn December 2019, we completed a private placement of our 1.0% convertible bonds due December 2024, or the December 2019 Bonds, to an institutional investor in Korea for an aggregate principal amount of 4.7 billion Korean Won (KRW) (approximately USD $4.1 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance). Net proceeds from the offering were $4.0 million, after deducting the offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we completed a private placement of aggregate principal amount of 18 billion Korean Won (KRW) (approximately USD $15.0 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance) of August 2019 Bonds issued to institutional investors led by Korea Investment Partners. Net proceeds from the offering were $14.5 million, after deducting the offering expenses payable by us. In August 2020, the August 2019 Bonds were fully converted into 4,692,364 shares of our common stock.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we completed a private placement of $78.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Net proceeds from the\noffering were $75.7 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses payable by us. During 2020, certain holders of the Notes converted principal amount of $62.1 million into an aggregate of 11,535,660 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $16.4 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.\nIssuances of Common Stock\nIn May 2018, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with an outside placement agent, or the Placement Agent, to sell shares of our common stock with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100.0 million, from time to time, through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which the Placement Agent would act as sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 3,340,678 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $9.1 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we entered into amendments to the Sales Agreement to increase the amount of our common stock that could be sold through the Placement Agent under the Sales Agreement to an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we sold 43,148,952 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $208.2 million. Following these sales, there was no remaining capacity under this Sales Agreement.\nOn April 3, 2020, we entered into a new sales agreement, or the New Sales Agreement, with the same Placement Agent to sell shares of our common stock. On that same day, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to the New Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $150.0 million. On May 12, 2020 we filed an additional prospectus supplement pursuant to the New Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of our common stock for an additional $100.0 million of gross proceeds, bringing the maximum gross proceeds of sales under the New Sales Agreement to $250.0 million. Through December 31, 2020, we sold 22,915,934 shares of common stock under the New Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $246.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was no remaining capacity under the New Sales Agreement.\nOn January 25, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 20,355,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.50 per share. The net proceeds, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, were $162.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, stock options to purchase 2,178,252 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $12.3 million, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $4.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, stock options to purchase 42,969 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $113,000, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $893,000. During the year ended December 31, 2018, stock options and warrants to purchase 756,853 shares of common stock were exercised for aggregate net proceeds of $2.4 million, which proceeds were offset by tax payments made related to net share settlement of RSU awards of $612,000.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $906.2 million and we expect to continue to operate at a loss for some time. The amount of the accumulated deficit will continue to increase, as it will be expensive to continue research and development efforts. These activities will require additional financing. If these activities are successful and if we receive approval from the FDA to market our DNA vaccine and DNA immunotherapy product candidates, then we will need to raise additional funding to market and sell the approved products and equipment. We cannot predict the outcome of the above matters at this time. We are evaluating potential collaborations as an additional way to fund operations. We believe that our current cash and short-term investments are sufficient to meet our planned working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows:\n\n(1) Amounts represent remaining contractual amounts due under our Notes, including interest based on the fixed rate of 6.5% per year. Although these Notes mature in March 2024, they may be converted into shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity would result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. During 2020, certain holders of the Notes converted principal amount of $62.1 million into an aggregate of 11,535,660 shares of our common stock. See Note 11, \"Convertible Debt\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report for further discussion.\n(2) Amounts represent contractual amounts due under our December 2019 Bonds, including interest based on the fixed rate of 1% per year plus a premium on such bonds to provide an internal rate of return with respect to such Bonds of 6% at maturity. Although these bonds mature in December 2024, they may be converted into equity securities prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. In August 2020, our August 2019 Bonds were fully converted into 4,962,364 shares of our common stock. See Note 11, \"Convertible Debt\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report for further discussion.\n(3) We have entered into operating leases for our facilities, which expire from 2023 to 2029, and operating leases for office equipment, which expire in 2021 and 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into two subleases for a portion of our Plymouth Meeting corporate headquarters facility through December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to receive aggregate future minimum lease payments totaling $1.2 million (non-discounted) over the duration of the sublease agreements, which expected payments are not included in the table above.\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on our business, consolidated results of operations or financial condition.", "item_7_tables": "Table

milestone revenue from Plumbline Life Sciences. \n\n- R&D expenses in 2020 were $94.2 million, up 7% from 2019, mainly due to higher costs related to INO-4800 clinical trials, CELLECTRA device development, and employee stock compensation. \n\n- G&A expenses in 2020 were $37.2 million, up 37% from 2019, primarily due to higher legal fees, marketing/communications expenses, and stock compensation costs.\n\n- Net loss in 2020 was $167.5 million compared to $120.6 million in 2019. The increase was driven by higher operating expenses and non-cash items like change in derivative liability. \n\n- Cash position remains strong - $411.6 million in cash/investments at December 31, 2020 versus $89.5 million at December 31, 2019, mainly due to $465 million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock.\n\n- Key focuses are advancing DNA vaccine and immunotherapy candidates, including INO-4800 for COVID-19, through clinical trials and toward commercialization. The company expects to continue operating at a loss given high R&D costs.\n\nIn summary, Inovio increased collaboration revenue and maintained a strong cash position in 2020, but continues to operate at a loss as it advances its pipeline of DNA medicines. The focus is on completing clinical studies and achieving regulatory approvals."}
