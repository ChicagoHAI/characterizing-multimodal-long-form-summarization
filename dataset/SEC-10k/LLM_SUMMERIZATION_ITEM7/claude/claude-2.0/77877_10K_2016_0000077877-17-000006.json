MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis, as well as other sections in this report, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Further, we encourage you to revisit the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this report.\nSUMMARY\n2016 Financial Overview of Operations and Liquidity\nProduction volumes increased to 22.2 MMBoe in 2016, including 0.2 MMBoe from our recent acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, compared to 15.4 MMBoe in 2015, representing an increase of 44 percent. The increase in production volumes was primarily attributable to our successful horizontal Niobrara and Codell drilling program in the Wattenberg Field. Crude oil production increased 25 percent in 2016, which comprised approximately 39 percent of total production. Natural gas production increased 55 percent and NGLs increased 70 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases were the result of our shift in focus to the higher rate of return drilling projects located in the higher gas to oil ratio inner and middle core areas of the Wattenberg Field during the first half of 2016. On a combined basis, total liquids production of crude oil and NGLs comprised 61 percent of production in 2016 compared to 64 percent of production in 2015, a decrease of four percent. For the month ended December 31, 2016, we maintained an average production rate of 73 MBoe per day, up from 52 MBoe per day for the month ended December 31, 2015.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales increased to $497.4 million in 2016 compared to $378.7 million in 2015, due to a 44 percent increase in production, offset in part by a nine percent decrease in the weighted-average realized prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, driven by lower commodity prices and changes in commodity mix. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales, coupled with the impact of positive net settlements of derivatives, also increased in 2016 as compared to 2015. When combining the physical commodity sales and the net settlements received on our commodity derivative instruments, the total net revenues increased 14 percent to $705.4 million in 2016 from $617.6 million in 2015. The low crude oil and natural gas index prices in 2016 and 2015 were the primary reason for the positive net settlements of $208.1 million and $238.9 million on commodity derivatives in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2016, we generated a net loss of $245.9 million, or $5.01 per diluted share. In the same period we generated $435.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, and invested $396.4 million in the development and exploration of our oil and natural gas properties, which is net of the change in accounts payable related to capital expenditures. Our cash flow from operations was $486.3 million and our adjusted cash flow from operations was $466.8 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash flow from operations are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures as defined and more fully described later in this section.\nOther significant changes impacting our 2016 results of operations include the following:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions in 2016 was a loss of $333.8 million compared to a loss of $35.8 million in 2015. The decrease in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions is largely driven by the normal monthly settlements of the commodity derivative instruments in 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value was attributable to hedging positions entered into in 2016 at lower strike prices and the upward shift in the crude oil and natural gas forward curves that occurred during 2016 versus a downward shift in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Production tax expense increased to $31.4 million in 2016 from $18.4 million in 2015 due to increased production of 44 percent and higher overall sales proceeds. Additionally, we had a higher effective production tax rate in 2016 primarily from a reduction in ad valorem credits from the prior year to offset current year severance taxes due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties was $10.0 million in 2016 compared to $161.6 million in 2015. The 2016 impairments are a result of the write-off of certain leases that were no longer part of our development plan and to reflect the fair value of other land and buildings that are held for sale. The Utica Shale was the largest component of the 2015 write-down which included both producing and non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative expense increased to $112.5 million in 2016 compared to $90.0 million in 2015.

The increase was primarily attributable to a $9.3 million charge for the bridge loan commitment related to our initial Delaware Basin acquisition, a $7.4 million increase in interest expense resulting from the issuance of our 2024 Senior Notes, and a $2.9 million increase in interest expense for the issuance of our 2021 Convertible Notes in September 2016. The increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the net settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2016 was $932.4 million compared to $402.2 million as of December 31, 2015. Available liquidity as of December 31, 2016 is comprised of $244.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $688.3 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. In December 2016, pursuant to an amendment to our credit facility and in conjunction with the closing of\nthe acquisitions of the Delaware Basin properties, we increased the aggregate commitment under our revolving credit facility from $450 million to $700 million.\nIn March 2016, we completed a public offering of 5.9 million shares of our common stock at a price to us of $50.11 per share. Net proceeds of the offering were $296.6 million, after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our revolving credit facility, the principal and interest owed upon the maturity of the $115 million face value of 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016 and for general corporate purposes. We settled the 2016 Convertible Notes with a combination of cash and stock, paying the aggregate principal amount, plus cash for fractional shares, totaling approximately $115 million. The conversion price for the 2016 Convertible Notes was $42.40 per share, resulting in the issuance of 792,406 shares of common stock for the excess conversion value.\nIn June 2016, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Energy Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (\"Noble\") to consolidate certain acreage positions in the core Wattenberg Field. In September 2016, we closed the acreage exchange transaction. Pursuant to the transaction, we exchanged leasehold acreage and, to a lesser extent, interests in certain development wells. Upon closing, we received approximately 13,500 net acres in exchange for approximately 11,700 net acres, with no cash exchanged between the parties. The difference in net acres was primarily due to variances in leasehold net revenue interests and third-party mid-stream contracts. This acreage trade has resulted in opportunities for longer length horizontal laterals with increased working interests, while minimizing potential surface impact.\nIn September 2016, we sold 9.1 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $558.5 million, we issued the 2024 Senior Notes for net proceeds of $392.2 million, and we issued the 2021 Convertible Senior Notes convertible at 11.7113 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount for net proceeds of $193.9 million (collectively, the \"Securities Issuances\"). The total net proceeds of $1.1 billion from the Securities Issuances were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions of the Delaware Basin properties, pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes.\nWe intend to continue to manage our liquidity position by a variety of means, including through the generation of cash flow from our operations, investment in projects with attractive rates of return, protection of cash flows on a portion of our anticipated sales through the use of an active commodity derivative program, utilization of our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, and the pursuit of capital markets transactions from time to time.\nDelaware Basin Acquisitions\nThrough a deliberate and disciplined process of searching for, and evaluating, a large-scale acquisition in a U.S. onshore basin that diversifies our operations and is capable of creating material long-term value-added growth, we recently acquired proved and unproved leasehold in the Delaware Basin in Reeves and Culberson Counties in Texas. The acquisition criteria focused on four key attributes:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>top-tier acreage in core geologic positions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant drilling inventory with additional expansion through down spacing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>portfolio optionality for capital allocation and diversification; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability to deliver long-term corporate accretion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the Delaware Basin acquisitions met these criteria.\nWe completed two acquisition transactions associated with the Delaware Basin. The first acquisition closed in early December 2016, and we acquired acreage, approximately 30 producing wells and related midstream infrastructure in Reeves and Culberson Counties, Texas, for an aggregate consideration to the sellers of approximately $1.64 billion, which was comprised of approximately $952.1 million in cash (including the repayment of $40.0 million of debt from the seller at closing) and 9.4 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $690.7 million at the time the acquisition closed. The total purchase price remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments as of the date of this report and we expect that it may take into mid-2017 until all post-closing adjustments are settled.\nThe acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, we conducted assessments of net assets acquired and recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values, while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred. The details of the purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the first transaction are presented below (in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cash, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retirement of seller's debt\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash consideration\n</td> <td>952,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Common stock, 9.4 million shares\n</td> <td>690,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other purchase price adjustments\n</td> <td>1,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total acquisition costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,643,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets acquired:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas properties - proved\n</td> <td>216,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas properties - unproved\n</td> <td>1,721,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure, pipeline, and other\n</td> <td>32,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction in progress\n</td> <td>12,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>62,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets acquired\n</td> <td>2,052,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current liabilities\n</td> <td>(24,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>(3,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax liabilities, net\n</td> <td>(379,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>(408,444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total identifiable net assets acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,643,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2016 results of operations of the acquired properties in the first transaction had a loss from operations of $1.7 million, which is included in our consolidated statements of operations for 2016.\nThe second transaction closed at the end of December 2016. In this transaction, we acquired primarily unproved acreage for cash consideration of $120.6 million. This acquisition is also subject to final settlement as there were some limited producing assets. The final settlement is not expected to be completed until mid-2017.\n2016 Drilling Overview\nDuring 2016, we continued to execute our strategic plan to grow production while preserving our financial strength and liquidity. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the Wattenberg Field. In August 2016, we decreased the number of automated drilling rigs to three in anticipation of higher working interests in wells drilled resulting from the acreage exchange. During 2016, we spud 128 gross horizontal, (109.4 net), wells and turned-in-line 140 gross, (109.7 net), horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field. Also in the Wattenberg Field, we participated in 17 gross (3.6 net) horizontal non-operated wells that were spud and 24 gross (5.0 net) horizontal non-operated wells which were turned-in-line. In the Utica Shale, we completed five gross horizontal (4.5 net) wells, all of which were turned-in-line in 2016. Following the closing of our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, we spud one well (0.9 net), and turned-in-line another well (1.0 net) prior to the end of 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our 2016 drilling and completion activity:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-process as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells spud during the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells turned-in-line to sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired in-process\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-process as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur in-process wells represent wells that are in the process of being drilled and/or have been drilled and are waiting to be fractured and/or for gas pipeline connection. We do not have a practice of inventorying our drilled but uncompleted wells. The majority of these in-process wells at each year end are drilled, but not completed as we do not begin the completion process until the entire well pad is drilled. All costs incurred through the end of the period have been capitalized or accrued to capital, while the capital investment to complete the wells will be incurred in the following year. The cost of completing these wells is included in our 2017 capital forecast.\n2017 Operational Outlook\nWe expect our production for 2017 to range between 30.0 MMBoe to 33.0 MMBoe and we estimate that our production rate will average approximately 82,200 to 90,400 Boe per day. We expect that 41 percent to 43 percent of our 2017 production will be comprised of crude oil and 20 percent to 22 percent will be NGLs, for total liquids of 61 percent to 65 percent of our total 2017 production. Our previously-announced 2017 capital forecast of between $725 million and $775 million is focused on continued development in the core Wattenberg Field and the integration of the core Delaware Basin assets. Due to recent cost escalation for services and the modification of our drilling schedule in the Delaware Basin, where we have accelerated the deployment of an additional drilling rig, we currently expect that our 2017 capital investment will be at or near the high end of the range. These changes to our capital investment outlook are not expected to impact our expected 2017 production as the incremental wells drilled are contemplated to be turned-in-line to sales late in the year.\nWattenberg Field. The 2017 investment outlook of approximately $470 million in the Wattenberg Field anticipates a three to four-rig drilling program based on our current commodity price outlook. Approximately $460 million of our 2017 capital investment program is expected to be allocated to development activities, comprised of approximately $440 million for our operated drilling program and approximately $20 million for wells drilled and operated by others. The remainder of the Wattenberg Field capital investment program is expected to be used for miscellaneous workover and capital projects. Wells in the Wattenberg Field typically have productive horizons at a depth of approximately 6,500 to 7,500 feet below the surface. In 2017, to help manage our priorities, we now anticipate spudding 137 and turning-in-line approximately 139 horizontal operated wells with lateral lengths of 5,000 to 10,000 feet.\nDelaware Basin. Our 2017 investment outlook contemplates operating a two-rig to four-rig program in the Delaware Basin from time to time during the year. Total capital investment in the Delaware Basin is estimated to be $300 million, of which approximately $235 million is allocated to spud 31 and turn-in-line an estimated 26 wells. Of the the 26 planned turn-in-lines, 14 are expected to have laterals of approximately 10,000 horizontal feet with an estimated 70 to 75 completion stages per well. Similarly spaced completion stages are anticipated for the remaining 12 turn-in-lines. Wells in the Delaware Basin typically have productive horizons at a depth of approximately 9,000 to 11,000 feet below the surface. Based on the timing of our operations and the requirements to hold acreage, we may adapt our capital investment program to drill wells in addition to those currently anticipated, as we are continuing to analyze terms of the leaseholds related to our recent acquisitions of properties in the basin. We plan to invest approximately $35 million for leasing, seismic, and technical studies with an additional $30 million for midstream-related projects including gas connections, salt water disposal wells, and surface location infrastructure.\nUtica Shale. At this time, we are currently evaluating all of our strategic alternatives with respect to our Utica Shale position. As a result of such evaluation, we are deferring our 2017 planned expenditure of $18 million to drill, complete, and turn-in-line two wells in Guernsey County. In 2017, our capital investment program for the Utica Shale is expected to include between $2 million to $3 million for additional leasing. Such leasing may be necessary to complete certain drilling operations if we decide to continue development of our existing position in the northern portion of our acreage.\nResults of

Crude oil production increased 25 percent in 2016, which comprised approximately 39 percent of total production. Natural gas production increased 55 percent and NGLs increased 70 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in crude oil are different from the comparative period because of our shift in focus to the higher rate of return drilling projects located in the higher gas to oil ratio inner and middle core areas of the Wattenberg Field during the first half of 2016. On a combined basis, total liquids production of crude oil and NGLs comprised 61 percent of production in 2016 compared to 64 percent of production in 2015, a decrease of four percent. Production volumes increased 65 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs was relatively consistent across commodities at 62 percent, 73 percent, and 61 percent, respectively, as we focused our 2015 and 2014 drilling on the middle and outer core areas of the Wattenberg Field. We currently expect our 2017 individual commodity growth and overall production growth to be similar.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in 2016 increased 31 percent compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes sold in 2016 of 22.2 MMBoe, up from 15.4 MMBoe in 2015. This was offset in part by a decrease in commodity prices and modest changes in the commodity mix, which resulted in a nine percent decline in the average realized price on a barrel of oil equivalent basis in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher volumes were primarily contributed from turning in-line to sales 140 new gross wells in the Wattenberg Field that delivered significant production volumes. Included in the 22.2 MMBoe is production of 0.2 MMBoe from our acquisitions of producing properties in the Delaware Basin. Our average daily sales volumes increased to 60.6 MBoe per day in 2016\ncompared to 42.1 MBoe per day in 2015 as a result of continued drilling and completion activities. The average NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices decreased by 11 percent and eight percent in 2016 compared to 2015. For crude oil the change was to $43.32 per barrel in 2016 from $48.80 per barrel in 2015, and we were able to offset the majority of the decrease in the NYMEX sales prices through actions that decreased our contractual deductions to $4.39 per barrel in 2016 from $9.95 per barrel in 2015. The natural gas realized sales price decreased more than the decrease in the NYMEX price because a portion of our deductions for natural gas are based on fixed price elements and have a more pronounced effect at lower prices.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in 2015 decreased 20 percent compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in commodity prices, resulting in a 51 percent decline in the price of a barrel of crude oil equivalent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was offset in part by the higher volumes sold in 2015 of 15.4 MMBoe, up from 9.3 MMBoe in 2014. Our average daily sales volumes increased to 42.1 MMBoe per day in 2015 compared to 25.5 MMBoe per day in 2014. The average NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices decreased by 47 percent and 40 percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring various times between 2012 and the summer of 2015, our production had been adversely affected by high line pressures in the natural gas gathering facilities in the Wattenberg Field. Such pressures did not materially affect our production during 2016 due to the investment in the midstream capabilities by our midstream providers and a decrease in development activity by certain producers in the Wattenberg Field resulting in more relative capacity being available to deliver our production. In 2016, approximately 90 percent of our production in the Wattenberg Field was delivered from horizontal wells, with the remaining 10 percent coming from vertical wells. The horizontal wells are less prone to issues than the vertical wells in that they are newer and have greater producing capacity and higher formation pressures and therefore tend to be more resilient from periodic gas system pressure issues.\nWe rely on our third-party midstream service providers to construct compression, gathering and processing facilities to keep pace with our, and the overall field's, production growth. We anticipate gathering system pressures to vary throughout the year, with increases coinciding with the warmer summer months. We, along with other operators in the Wattenberg Field, continue to work closely with our third-party midstream providers in an effort to ensure adequate system capacity going forward as evidenced by a recent commitment of DCP to build additional gathering and processing in the field. This expansion of gathering and processing facilities is expected to improve natural gas gathering pipelines and processing facilities and assist in the control of line pressures in the Wattenberg Field. However, the timing and availability of adequate infrastructure is not within our control and if our midstream provider's construction projects are delayed, we could experience higher line pressures that may negatively impact our ability to fulfill our growth plans. Total system infrastructure needs may also be affected by a number of factors, including potential increases in production from the Wattenberg Field and warmer than expected weather.\nCrude Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and our ability to market our production effectively. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have a high degree of volatility. While the price of crude oil decreased during the first half of 2016 compared to 2015, prices increased during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of the year as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016. Natural gas prices decreased during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to domestic oversupply driven by a lack of a normal winter withdrawal cycle in the winter of 2015-2016. We experienced improved NGL pricing towards the end of 2016; however, due to an oversupply of nearly all domestic NGLs products, our average realized sales price for NGLs during most of 2016 reflected the same depressed levels seen during 2015. With the initiation of ethane exports and increased domestic demand for NGLs driven by the completion of petrochemical processing plants, the industry is beginning to see NGL prices trend upward, including in the near term forward market.\nCrude Oil. Crude oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, financial markets, and national and international politics. In the Wattenberg Field, our crude oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly and longer term transportation provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials. We have entered into commitments ranging in term from one month to over three years to deliver crude oil to competitive markets, resulting in improved overall average deductions in 2016, as noted previously. We continue to pursue various alternatives with respect to oil transportation, particularly in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward further improving pricing and limiting our use of trucking through delivering greater quantities of our crude oil via pipeline to liquid markets. We began delivering crude oil in accordance with our long term commitment to the White Cliffs pipeline in July 2015. The White Cliffs agreement is one of several we have entered into to facilitate deliveries of a portion of our crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma market. In addition, to the White Cliffs agreement described above, we have signed a long-term agreement with Saddle Butte Rockies Midstream, LLC for gathering of crude oil at the wellhead by pipeline from several of our producing pads in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward minimizing truck traffic, increasing reliability, reducing the overall physical footprint of our well pads, and reducing emissions. We began delivering crude oil into this pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued to grow these volumes during 2016.\nIn the Delaware Basin, our crude oil production is sold at the wellhead and transported via trucks to pipelines that deliver the oil to the Midland, Texas, crude oil market. Given the increased level of activity in the form of acquisitions, leasing, and the increases in rig count in the Delaware Basin over the last six months, we expect the balance between production and pipeline takeaway capacity to tighten during 2017. At the current time, there are pipeline, truck and rail pathways out of the basin, all of which are available to us. We are evaluating near-term and longer-term solutions that contemplate the increased activity levels we expect, as well as our anticipated future production. These may include longer-term sales agreements.\nIn the Utica Shale, crude oil and condensate is sold to local purchasers at each individual pad based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials, and is typically transported by the purchasers via truck to local refineries, rail facilities, or barge loading terminals on the Ohio River. To date, we have not experienced any issues with takeaway capacity in this region for our crude oil.\nNatural Gas. Natural gas prices vary quite significantly by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity, and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on CIG pricing provisions or local distribution company monthly/daily pricing provisions, adjusted for certain deductions. Our natural gas from the Delaware Basin is sold into the Waha hub and El Paso index markets. Natural gas produced in the Utica Shale is sold based on TETCO M-2 pricing.\nNatural Gas Liquids. Our NGL sales are priced based upon the components of the product and are correlated to the price of crude oil. Our price for NGLs produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mt. Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed. While NGL prices remained low during the majority of 2016, we realized improvements in NGL pricing during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are seeing this improvement continue in early 2017. Given the lack of liquidity in the forward markets, it is unclear if this trend will continue. Delaware Basin NGLs sales are indexed to NYMEX and sold into the Mt. Belvieu, Texas market. The NGLs produced in the Utica Shale are sold based on month-to-month pricing to various markets.\nOur crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales are recorded under either the net-back\u201d or \"gross\" method of accounting, depending upon the related purchase agreement. We use the \"net-back\" method of accounting for natural gas and NGLs, as well as the majority of our crude oil production from the Wattenberg Field, for all commodities in the Delaware Basin, and for crude oil from the Utica Shale as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide transportation, gathering, and processing services. In these situations, the purchaser pays us proceeds based on a percent of the proceeds, or have fixed our sales price at index less a specified deduction. We sell our commodities at the wellhead or what is tantamount to the wellhead in situations where we gather multiple wells into larger pads, and collect a price and recognize revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and therefore embedded in the wellhead price. The \"net-back\" method results in the recognition of a net sales price that is lower than the indices for which the production is based because the operating costs and profit of the midstream facilities are embedded in the net price we earn. We use the \"gross\" method of accounting for Wattenberg Field crude oil delivered through the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines, and for natural gas and NGLs sales related to production from the Utica Shale as the purchasers do not provide transportation, gathering or processing services as a function of the price we earn. Rather, we contract separately with the midstream provider for the applicable transport and processing based on a per unit basis. Under this method, we recognize revenues based on the gross selling price and recognize transportation, gathering, and processing expenses. As a result of the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte agreements, during 2016 and 2015, our Wattenberg Field crude oil average sales price increased approximately $1.60 and $0.73, respectively, per barrel, relative to the benchmark price because we recognized the costs for transportation on the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines as an increase in revenues and transportation expense, rather than as a deduction from revenues.\nLease Operating Expenses\nLease operating expenses were $60.0 million in 2016 compared to $57.0 million in 2015. Due to newer and more horizontal well completions that deliver larger volumes of production per well than older vertical wells, we are seeing the lease operating costs spread over more volume, resulting in lower lease operating cost per Boe. This is reflected in the fact that our per Boe lease operating expense decreased by 27 percent to $2.70 for 2016 from $3.71 for 2015. The $3.0 million increase in the total lease operating expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million for increases in wages and employee benefits related to an increase in headcount, including costs for additional contract labor, $1.8 million for additional leased compressors to address line pressures, and an increase of $1.5 million related to lease operating expenses for the acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects of $3.2 million due to a reduction in new remediation projects, and a decrease of $1.4 million related to fewer workover and maintenance related projects. With our entry into the Delaware Basin, we anticipate that our per Boe lease operating cost will be higher initially as we have limited wells and production over which to apply our lease operating costs. With time, we expect that the lease operating costs per Boe in the Delaware Basin will improve.\nLease operating expenses were $57.0 million in 2015 compared to $42.4 million in 2014. The $14.6 million increase in lease operating expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million for environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects due to increases in the number of projects and an increase in per project expenses, an increase of $3.4 million for additional wages and employee benefits primarily due to additional headcount, including costs for additional contract labor, $2.0 million for additional workover and maintenance related projects, $1.4 million for additional compressors to correct high line pressures in the Wattenberg Field, $1.0 million for the increasing number of non-operated wells in the Wattenberg Field, and $0.9 million for additional costs pertaining to water hauling and disposal. Lease operating expenses per Boe decreased significantly to $3.71 for 2015 from $4.56 in 2014, as a result of increased production.\nProduction Taxes\nProduction taxes are directly related to crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales. Production taxes are comprised of both statutory severance tax rates as well as ad valorem tax rates for the applicable production periods. There are a number of adjustments to the statutory rates based on certain credits that are determined based on activity levels and relative commodity prices from year-to-year. The $13.0 million, or 70 percent, increase in production taxes for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to the 31 percent increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales, higher ad valorem mill rates, and an overall higher effective tax rate resulting from a decrease in ad valorem tax credits available from the prior year to offset current year severance taxes, driven by the relatively depressed commodity pricing in 2015. These items resulted in effective production tax rates of 6.3 percent and 4.9 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Similarly, the $7.2 million, or 28 percent, decrease in production taxes for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily related to the 20 percent decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales.\nOn a per Boe basis, the increase in rates in 2016 impacted the production tax expense, which increased to $1.42 for 2016 compared to $1.20 for 2015 due to the higher effective tax rate noted above. With the decrease in commodity pricing for 2015, production taxes per Boe decreased to $1.20 for 2015 compared to $2.76 for 2014. These items resulted in effective production tax rates of 4.9 percent and 5.4 percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTransportation, Gathering and Processing Expenses\nThe $8.3 million, or 81 percent, increase in transportation, gathering, and processing expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 was mainly attributable to the costs associated with the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines in the Wattenberg Field as we began delivering crude oil on these pipelines in July 2015 and December 2015, respectively. We expect to continue to incur these oil transportation costs pursuant to our long-term firm transportation agreement for 6,600 gross barrels per day. The $5.6 million, or 121 percent, increase in transportation, gathering, and processing expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly attributable to costs associated with the White Cliffs pipeline. Transportation, gathering, and processing expenses per Boe increased to $0.83 for 2016 compared to $0.66 for 2015 and $0.49 for 2014. By using these pipelines and having the pipelines be able to deliver product to the Cushing, Oklahoma market, we benefit from the liquidity associated with the purchasers' delivery point.\nCommodity Price Risk Management, Net\nWe use commodity derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. We have in place a variety of collars, fixed-price swaps, and basis swaps on a portion of our estimated crude oil and natural gas production. Because we sell all of our crude oil and natural gas production at prices related to the indexes inherent in our underlying derivative instruments, we ultimately realize value related to our collars of no less than the floor and no more than the ceiling and, for our commodity swaps, we ultimately realize the fixed price value related to our swaps.\nCommodity price risk management, net, includes cash settlements upon maturity of our derivative instruments and the change in fair value of unsettled derivatives related to our crude oil and natural gas production. Commodity price risk management, net, does not include derivative transactions related to our gas marketing, which are included in sales from and cost of gas marketing.\nNet settlements of commodity derivative instruments are based on the difference between the crude oil, natural gas and natural gas index prices at the settlement date of our commodity derivative instruments compared to the respective strike prices contracted for the settlement months that were established at the time we entered into the commodity derivative transaction. The net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives is comprised of the net value increase or decrease in the beginning-of-period fair value of commodity derivative instruments that settled during the period, and the net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives during the period or from inception of any new contracts entered into during the applicable period. The corresponding impact of settlement of the commodity derivative instruments during the period is included in net settlements for the period as discussed above. The net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives during the period is primarily related to shifts in the crude oil and natural gas forward curves and changes in certain differentials.\nThe following table presents net settlements and net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives included in commodity price risk management, net:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity price risk management gain (loss), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net settlements of commodity derivative instruments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas basis protection swaps\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net settlements of commodity derivative instruments\n</td> <td>208.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivative instruments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of settlements included in prior period changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments\n</td> <td>(220.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>(78.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>(37.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas basis swaps\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivative instruments\n</td> <td>(333.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commodity price risk management gain (loss), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExploration Expense\nThe following table presents the major components of exploration expense:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic purchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, personnel and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total exploration expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeological and geophysical costs.

As a result of our assessments, we recorded impairment charges of $150.3 million and $158.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down our Utica Shale proved and unproved properties. Of these impairment charges, $24.7 million and $112.6 million were recorded in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down certain capitalized well costs on our Utica Shale proved producing properties. In 2015 and 2014, we also recorded\nimpairment charges of $125.6 million and $45.7 million to write-down our Utica Shale lease acquisition costs. The impairment charges, which are included in the consolidated statements of operations line item impairment of properties and equipment, represented the amount by which the carrying value of these crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair values. We continued to monitor whether any further impairments were triggered and required measurement throughout 2016 given the continued volatility of commodity prices and the continued capital investment in the development and acquisition of oil and gas properties. No such triggering events occurred during 2016. Impairment charges in 2016 relate to the retirement of certain leases that were no longer part of our development plan and to reflect the fair value of other property and equipment that was held for sale as of December 31, 2016. Future deterioration of commodity prices or other operating circumstances could result in additional impairment charges to our properties and equipment.\nAmortization of individually insignificant unproved properties. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 is due to the impairment of leases in 2015, which significantly reduced total lease costs. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to a higher number of insignificant leases that were subject to amortization in 2015, primarily in the Utica Shale.\nLand and buildings. The impairment charge for 2016 represents the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value, less the cost to sell, of a field operating facility in Greeley, Colorado, and 12 acres of land located adjacent to our Bridgeport, West Virginia, regional headquarters. The fair values of these assets were determined based upon estimated future cash flows from unrelated third-party bids.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $22.5 million, or 25 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in cash based general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to $12.2 million of legal and professional fees related to the acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, a $7.7 million increase in payroll and employee benefits due to per capita increases in wages and increases in headcount given the increase in our personnel by nine percent over the course of 2016. Stock-based compensation expense in 2016 and 2015 was $19.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $33.6 million, or 27 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to $40.3 million recorded in 2014 in connection with certain partnership-related class action litigation and estimates relating to litigation arising from bankruptcy proceedings of certain affiliated partnerships and a $1.8 million decrease in costs for legal and other professional services in 2015. The decreases were offset in part by an $8.2 million increase in payroll and employee benefits in 2015, of which $3.3 million was related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2014 was $20.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\nCrude oil and natural gas properties. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, we invested $396.4 million, $554.3 million and $663.4 million, which is net of the change in accounts payable related to capital expenditures, in the development of our oil and natural gas properties, respectively. We also incurred $1.76 billion to acquire proved reserves during 2016. We did not invest in any acquisitions of proved reserves in 2015 or 2014. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties is directly related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties was $413.1 million, $298.8 million, and $188.5 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year change in DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties were primarily due to the following:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in weighted-average depreciation, depletion and amortization rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents our DD&A expense rates for crude oil and natural gas properties:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Region/Area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(per Boe)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wattenberg Field\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delaware Basin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utica Shale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total weighted-average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2016 rate for the Delaware Basin is related to our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. The slight decrease in the Wattenberg Field rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of our 2016 year-end reserves. The decrease in the Utica Shale DD&A expense rates in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to the effect of impairments recorded in 2015 and 2014 to write-down certain capitalized well costs on our Utica Shale proved producing properties.\nProvision for Uncollectible Notes Receivable\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.7 million to impair two third-party notes receivable whose collection was not reasonably assured. Later in 2016, we collected a $0.7 million promissory note and reversed the related provision and allowance for uncollectible notes receivable.\nAccretion of Asset Retirement Obligations\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\") for 2016 increased by $0.8 million, or 13 percent, compared to 2015, and increased by $2.9 million, or 84 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due to adding new wells and the associated increase in amortization expense. The increase in 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the estimated useful life of certain vertical wells in the Wattenberg Field.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $14.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $9.3 million charge for the bridge loan commitment related to acquisitions of properties in the Delaware Basin, a $7.4 million increase in interest for the issuance of our 2024 Senior Notes, and a $2.9 million increase in interest expense for the issuance of our 2021 Convertible Notes in September 2016. The increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the net settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016. The entire $9.3 million of interest expense attributed to the bridge loan facility was expensed in 2016 as the bridge loan was replaced with equity and longer term debt financing.\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $0.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease is primarily comprised of a $1.6 million decrease attributable to an increase in capitalized interest, offset in part by a $0.9 million increase due to higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2015.\nInterest costs capitalized in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $4.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.5 million, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe current income tax benefit (expense) in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $9.9 million, $(3.1) million, and $(0.5) million, respectively. Current income taxes generally relate to the cash that is paid or recovered for income taxes associated with the applicable period. The remaining portion of the total income tax expense is comprised of deferred income tax expense (benefit), which is a result of differences in the timing of deductions for our GAAP presentation of financial statements and the income tax regulations.\nFor 2016, 2015, and 2014, the effective income tax rate (the \"rate\") of 37.4 percent, 35.9 percent, and 39.5 percent on income (loss) from operations differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to state taxes and excess stock compensation benefits, offset by nondeductible expenses that consist primarily of officers' compensation cost and government lobbying expenses.\nAs of the date of this report, we are current with our income tax filings in all applicable state jurisdictions. We continue to voluntarily participate in the Internal Revenue Service's (\"IRS\") Compliance Assurance Program (the \"CAP Program\") for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years. We have received a full acceptance notice from the IRS for our filed 2015 federal tax return and the IRS's post filing review is complete.\nWe acquired a net deferred tax liability of $379.9 million in 2016 associated with a lack of tax basis relative to the purchase price of one of the Delaware Basin acquisitions. This has resulted in a material increase in our deferred tax liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nThere has been increased discussion by the federal government of a potential reduction of the corporate income tax rate and corresponding changes to the tax code. In the event of a change in federal or state income tax rates, the impact of the rate change will be required to be recorded through deferred income tax expense. Should statutory income tax rates decrease, our deferred tax liability would decrease, resulting in deferred tax benefit for the period. If the statutory income tax rates increase, our deferred tax liability would increase resulting in a deferred tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAppalachian Marcellus Shale Assets. In October 2014, we completed the sale of our entire 50 percent ownership interest in PDCM to an unrelated third-party for aggregate consideration, after our share of PDCM's debt repayment and other working capital adjustments, of approximately $192.0 million, comprised of approximately $152.8 million in net cash proceeds and a promissory note due in 2020 of approximately $39.0 million. The transaction included the buyer's assumption of our share of the firm transportation commitment related to the assets owned by PDCM, as well as our share of PDCM's natural gas hedging positions in effect at the time. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $76.3 million. The divestiture represented a strategic shift in our operations. Accordingly, our proportionate share of PDCM's Marcellus Shale results of operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for 2014 and prior periods in the Selected Financial Information disclosures.\nNet Income (Loss)/Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nThe factors resulting in changes in net loss in 2016 and 2015 compared to net income in 2014 are discussed above. These same reasons similarly impacted adjusted net income (loss), a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, with the exception of the net change in fair value of unsettled derivatives, adjusted for taxes, of $208.9 million, $22.2 million, and $193.1 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Adjusted net loss, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was $37.0 million, $46.1 million, and $37.7 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, below, for a more detailed discussion of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, our revolving credit facility, proceeds raised in debt, and equity capital market transactions and asset sales. In 2016, our primary sources of liquidity were net cash flows from operating activities of $486.3 million, the net proceeds received from the March 2016 public offering of our common stock of approximately $296.6 million, and the net proceeds from the Securities Issuances of approximately $1.1 billion.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the March 2016 common stock offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our revolving credit facility and the principal amount owed upon the maturity of the 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the Securities Issuances were used to fund a portion of the purchase price and related fees for acquisitions in the Delaware Basin and for general corporate purposes.\nOur primary source of cash flows from operating activities is the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Fluctuations in our operating cash flows are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and we partially manage this volatility through our use of commodity derivative instruments. In 2016 and 2015, net settled commodity derivatives comprised approximately 43 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of our cash flows from operating activities. Based upon our hedge position and assuming year-end forward strip pricing, in 2017 and thereafter our derivatives may not be a significant source of cash flow, and may result in cash outflows in 2017 and 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our derivatives was a net liability of $70.0 million. Based on the forward pricing strip at December 31, 2016, we would expect negative net settlements totaling approximately $45 million during 2017.\nThe covenants under our revolving credit agreement limit the volume of our expected future production that we may hedge. However, we may enter into commodity derivative instruments with future settlement periods of up to sixty months from the date of issuance of the commodity derivative instrument. We do not have minimum hedging requirements associated with our revolving credit facility.\nOur net working capital fluctuates for various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments and changes in our cash and cash equivalents due to our historical practice of utilizing excess cash to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility when we have borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital surplus of $129.2 million compared to a surplus of $30.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in working capital is primarily the result of an increase of $243.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the $112.9 million reduction in the current portion of long-term debt due to the settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016, and no current amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016, partially offset by a negative change in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments of $264.9 million from 2015 to 2016. The net cash position was a result of the Securities Issuances and our desire to have cash available to fund the portion of the 2017 capital investment program that is expected to exceed operating cash flows.\nWe ended 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $244.1 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $688.3 million, providing for a total liquidity position of $932.4 million, compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2015. The change in liquidity of $530.2 million, or 131.8 percent, was primarily attributable to:\n\u2022net cash flows from operating activities of $486.3 million;\n\u2022net proceeds received from the March 2016 public offering of our common stock of approximately $296.6 million;\n\u2022net proceeds from the Securities Issuances of approximately $1.1 billion; offset in part by,\n\u2022cash outflows for capital investments associated with development, exploration, and acquisition activity of\n$1.76 billion during 2016; and\n\u2022cash payment of approximately $115 million upon the maturity of our Convertible Notes in May 2016.\nBased on our expectations of cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalent balance and availability under our revolving credit facility, we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our planned activities during 2017.\nIn March 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. Effective upon filing, the shelf provides for the potential sale of an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by depository shares, warrants or purchase contracts, as well as units that may include any of these securities or securities of other entities. The shelf registration statement is intended to allow us to be proactive in our ability to raise capital and to have the flexibility to raise such funds in one or more offerings should we perceive market conditions to be favorable. We have utilized the shelf registration statement to raise capital from time to time, and we may utilize the facility in the future to raise additional capital.\nOur revolving credit facility is a borrowing base facility and availability under the facility is subject to redetermination each May and November, based upon a quantification of our proved reserves at each June 30 and December 31, respectively. In September 2016, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, amended the revolving credit facility to permit the completion of acquisitions in the Delaware Basin and, effective upon closing of the acquisitions, adjusted the interest rate payable on amounts borrowed under the facility, increased the aggregate commitments under the facility from $450 million to $700 million, and reduced our maximum leverage ratio to 4.00:1.00 times as described in more detail below. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is May 2020. In October 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, reaffirmed our borrowing base at $700 million and, increased the percentage of our\nfuture production that we are permitted to hedge. Our borrowing base availability under the revolving credit facility is limited under our 2022 Senior Notes to the greater of $700 million or the calculated value under an Adjusted Consolidated Tangible Net Asset test, as defined.\nOur borrowings bear interest at either the LIBOR or prime rate plus an applicable margin, depending on the percentage of the commitment that has been utilized as of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin is 1.25%, and the unused commitment fee is 0.50%.\nWe had no balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, RNG had issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit of approximately $11.7 million in favor of a third-party transportation service provider to secure firm transportation of the natural gas produced by third-party producers for whom we market production in the Appalachian Basin. The letter of credit expires in September 2017 and is automatically extended annually in accordance with the letter of credit's terms and conditions. The letter of credit reduces the amount of available funds under our revolving credit facility by an amount equal to the letter of credit. While we have added and expect to continue to add producing reserves through our drilling operations, the effect of any such reserve additions on our borrowing base could be offset by other factors including, among other things, a prolonged period of depressed commodity prices or regulatory pressure on lenders to reduce their exposure to exploration and production companies.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. The covenants require that we maintain: (i) total debt of less than 4.00 times the trailing 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives, exploration expense, gains (losses) on sales of assets and other non-cash, gains (losses) (\"EBITDAX\"), and (ii) an adjusted current ratio of at least 1.00:1.00. Our adjusted current ratio is adjusted by eliminating the impact on our current assets and liabilities of recording the fair value of crude oil and natural gas commodity derivative instruments. Additionally, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are added to the current asset calculation and the current portion of our revolving credit facility debt is eliminated from the current liabilities calculation. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants with a 2.10 times debt to EBITDAX ratio and a 5.00:1.00 current ratio. We expect to remain in compliance into the foreseeable future.\nThe indentures governing our 2024 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes contain customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (a) incur additional debt including limitations as to availability under our revolving credit facility, (b) make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase, redeem, or retire capital stock, (c) sell assets, including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries, (d) restrict the payment of dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to us, (e) create liens that secure debt, (f) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (g) merge or consolidate with another company. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance into the foreseeable future.\nIn January 2017, pursuant to the filing of the supplemental indentures for the 1.25% convertible senior notes due in 2021 (\"2021 Convertible Senior Notes\"), the 2024 Senior Notes, and the 2022 Senior Notes, our subsidiary PDC Permian, Inc., became a guarantor of the notes.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Our net cash flows from operating activities are primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, net settlements from our commodity derivative positions, operating costs, and general and administrative expenses. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015. The $75.2 million increase was primarily due to the increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $118.7 million. We also realized an increase in the change of funds held for future distribution of $36.5 million, and an increase in the deferral of income taxes of $13.1 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in monthly derivative commodity settlements of $30.8 million, and increases in general and administrative expense of $22.5 million, interest expense of $14.4 million, production taxes of $13.0 million and transportation, gathering, and processing expenses of $8.3 million.\nCash flows provided by operating activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014. The $174.4 million increase was primarily due to the increase in normal monthly derivative commodity settlements of $241.0 million and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $33.6 million and production taxes of $7.2 million. The increase was offset by the decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $92.7 million and an increase in lease operating costs of $14.6 million.\nAdjusted cash flows from operations, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, increased by $46.0 million in 2016 to $466.8 million, and $170.6 million to $420.8 million in 2015, when compared to the respective prior years. These changes were primarily due to the same factors mentioned above for changes in cash flows provided by operating activities, without regard to timing of cash payments and/or receipts of our assets and liabilities of $19.5 million and $9.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, decreased by $7.6 million in 2016 to $435.6 million from $443.2 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.0 million, the decrease in net settlements from our monthly derivative commodity settlements of $30.8 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $22.5 million, and a $27.8 million increase in production and exploration expense. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $118.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $78.9 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in normal monthly derivative commodity settlements of $241.0 million and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $33.6 million. The increase was partially\noffset by the decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $92.7 million, and an $88.8 million decrease in contribution margins from discontinued operations and a $14.6 million increase in lease operating costs.\nInvesting Activities. Because crude oil and natural gas production from a well declines rapidly in the first few years of production, we need to continue to invest significant amounts of capital in order to maintain and grow our production and replace our reserves. If capital markets are not available in the future, we will be limited to our cash flows from operations and liquidity under our revolving credit facility as the sources for funding our capital investments.\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consist of the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, net of dispositions of crude oil and natural gas properties. During 2016, our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin comprised the majority of our cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in the Delaware Basin acquisitions was $1.1 billion and we used cash of $436.9 million for our oil and gas operations. Our total cash used in investing activities during 2016 was approximately $1.5 billion. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the Wattenberg Field. In August 2016, we decreased the number of automated drilling rigs to three in anticipation of higher working interests in wells drilled resulting from an acreage exchange. In the Utica Shale, we drilled and completed five gross (4.5 net) wells, all of which were turned-in-line to sales in 2016. With the closing of our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, we completed the drilling of two wells that were in-process at closing, spud an additional well, and turned-in-line one well prior to the end of 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $604.3 million during 2015 was primarily related to cash utilized for our drilling operations. Net cash used in investing activities of $474.1 million during 2014 was primarily related to cash utilized for our drilling operations of $623.8 million, offset in part by the $152.8 million net cash proceeds received from the sale of our entire 50 percent ownership interest in PDCM.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash from financing activities in 2016 was primarily related to the $855.1 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of 9.4 million shares of our common stock, $392.2 million of net proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Senior Notes and $193.9 million of net proceeds from issuance of the 2021 Convertible Notes, partially offset by the $115 million payment owed upon the maturity of the 2016 Convertible Notes and net payments of approximately $37.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility.\nNet cash from financing activities in 2015 was primarily related to $202.9 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock in March 2015, partially offset by net payments of approximately $19.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Net cash from financing activities in 2014 were primarily comprised of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $63.8 million to execute our capital budget.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and contingent commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

We believe that the casualty insurance coverage we and our subcontractors carry is adequate to meet this potential liability.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation that we believe would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the following policies as critical to business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. This is not a comprehensive list of all of the accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with no need for our judgment in the application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and we may use significant judgment in the application. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on historical experience, observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the footnote titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Properties. We account for our crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of proved developed producing properties, successful exploratory wells and developmental dry hole costs are capitalized and depreciated or depleted by the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed producing reserves. Property acquisition costs are depreciated or depleted on the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves.\nAnnually, we engage independent petroleum engineers to prepare reserve and economic evaluations of all our properties on a well-by-well basis as of December 31. We adjust our crude oil and natural gas reserves for major acquisitions, new drilling, and divestitures during the year as needed. The process of estimating and evaluating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, revisions in existing reserve estimates occur. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent our most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates over time. Because estimates of reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense, a change in our estimated reserves could have an effect on our net income (loss).\nExploration costs, including geological and geophysical expenses, the acquisition of seismic data covering unproved acreage,\nand delay rentals, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory well drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if the well is determined to be nonproductive. The status of each in-progress well is reviewed quarterly to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting. Exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized as long as the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and we are making sufficient progress assessing our reserves and economic and operating viability. If an in-progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful prior to the issuance of the financial statements, the costs incurred prior to the end of the reporting period are charged to exploration expense. If we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of the financial statements, the well is classified as \"suspended well costs\" until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations to evaluate the pertinent geological and engineering data obtained. At the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well's productive status, the well is removed from the suspended well status and the proper accounting treatment is applied.\nThe acquisition costs of unproved properties are capitalized when incurred, until such properties are transferred to proved properties or charged to expense when expired, impaired, or amortized. Unproved crude oil and natural gas properties with individually significant acquisition costs are periodically assessed, and any impairment in value is charged to impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The\namount of impairment recognized on unproved properties which are not individually significant is determined by amortizing the costs of such properties within appropriate fields based on our historical experience, acquisition dates and average lease terms, with the amortization recognized in impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The valuation of unproved properties is subjective and requires us to make estimates and assumptions which, with the passage of time, may prove to be materially different from actual realizable values.\nWe assess our crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment upon a triggering event or when circumstances warrant\nby comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a field-by-field basis using estimated production based upon prices at which we reasonably estimate the commodity to be sold. Any impairment in value is charged to impairment of properties and equipment. The estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Any downward revisions in estimates to our reserve quantities, expectations of falling commodity prices, or rising operating costs could result in a triggering event, and therefore, a reduction in undiscounted future net cash flows and an impairment of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Although our cash flow estimates are based on the relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nCrude Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Sales Revenue Recognition. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a determinable price, delivery has occurred, rights and responsibility of ownership have transferred and collection of revenue is reasonably assured. We record sales revenue based on an estimate of the volumes delivered at estimated prices as determined by the applicable sales agreement. We estimate our sales volumes based on company-measured volume readings. We then adjust our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in subsequent periods based on the data received from our purchasers that reflects actual volumes and prices received. We receive payment for sales from one to two months after actual delivery has occurred. The differences in sales estimates and actual sales are recorded one to two months later. Historically, these differences have been immaterial. If a sale is deemed uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful collection is recorded.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Our fair value measurements are estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity.\nCommodity Derivative Financial Instruments. We measure the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments based on a pricing model that utilizes market-based inputs, including but not limited to the contractual price of the underlying position, current market prices, natural gas, and crude oil forward curves, discount rates such as the LIBOR curve for a similar duration of each outstanding position, volatility factors and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of our credit standing on the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities and the effect of our counterparties' credit standings on the fair value of commodity derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding commodity derivative position.\nWe validate our fair value measurement through the review of counterparty statements and other supporting documentation, the determination that the source of the inputs is valid, the corroboration of the original source of inputs through access to multiple quotes, if available, or other information and monitoring changes in valuation methods and assumptions. While we use common industry practices to develop our valuation techniques, changes in our pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values. While we believe our valuation method is appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of a different methodology, or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.\nNet settlements on our commodity derivative instruments are initially recorded to accounts receivable or payable, as applicable, and may not be received from or paid to counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts within the same accounting period. Such settlements typically occur the month following the maturity of the commodity derivative instrument. We have evaluated the credit risk of the counterparties holding our commodity derivative assets, which are primarily financial institutions who are also major lenders in our revolving credit facility, giving consideration to amounts outstanding for each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding commodity derivative position. Based on our evaluation, we have determined that the potential impact of nonperformance of our counterparties on the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments is not significant.\nDeferred Income Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax asset is not expected to be realized under the preceding criteria, we establish a valuation allowance. The factors which we consider in assessing whether we will realize the value of deferred income tax assets involve judgments and estimates of both amount and timing. The judgments used in applying these policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for Business Combinations. We utilize the purchase method to account for acquisitions of businesses and assets. The value of the purchase consideration takes into account the degree to which the consideration is objective and measurable such as cash consideration paid to a seller. With the issuance of equity, restrictions upon the sale of the issued stock are taken into consideration. Pursuant to purchase method accounting, we allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocations are based on appraisals, discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates by management. When appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of crude oil and natural gas properties within the same regions and use that data as a basis for fair market value as such sales represent the amount at which a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties.\nIn estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved developed producing, proved developed non-producing, proved undeveloped and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties, and other non-crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves. When appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of crude oil and natural gas properties within the same regions and use that data as a basis for fair market value; for example, the amount at which a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties. We estimate future prices by using the applicable forward pricing strip to apply to our estimate of reserve quantities acquired, and estimates of future operating and development costs, to arrive at an estimate of future net revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues are discounted using a market-based weighted-average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted-average cost of capital rate is subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties, we reduce the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves by additional risk-weighting factors.\nWe record deferred taxes for any differences between the assigned values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee the footnote titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted cash flows from operations. We define adjusted cash flows from operations as the cash flows earned or incurred from operating activities, without regard to changes in operating assets and liabilities. We believe it is important to consider adjusted cash flows from operations, as well as cash flows from operations, as we believe it often provides more transparency into what drives the changes in our operating trends, such as production, prices, operating costs, and related operational factors, without regard to whether the related asset or liability was received or paid during the same period. We also use this measure because the timing of cash received from our assets, cash paid to obtain an asset or payment of our obligations has been only a timing issue from one period to the next as we have not had accounts receivable collection problems, nor been unable to purchase assets or pay our obligations.\nAdjusted net income (loss). We define adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives, each adjusted for tax effects. We believe it is important to consider adjusted net income (loss), as well as net income (loss). We believe this measure often provides more transparency into our operating trends, such as production, prices, operating costs, net settlements from derivatives and related factors, without regard to changes in our net income (loss) from mark-to-market adjustments resulting from net changes in the fair value of unsettled derivatives. Additionally, other items which we believe are not indicative of future results may be excluded to clearly identify operating trends.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives, interest expense, net of interest income, income taxes, impairment of properties and equipment, depreciation, depletion, and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), nor as an indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA includes certain non-cash costs incurred by us and does not take into account changes in operating assets and liabilities. Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA is relevant because it is a measure of our operational and financial performance, as well as a measure of our liquidity, and is used by our management, investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others that utilize our financial statements to analyze such things as:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating performance and return on capital as compared to our peers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>financial performance of our assets and our valuation without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations and commitments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>viability of acquisition opportunities and capital investment projects, including the related rate of return.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPV-10. We define PV-10 as the estimated present value of the future net cash flows from our proved reserves before income taxes, discounted using a 10 percent discount rate. We believe that PV-10 provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. We believe that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our reserves. Professional analysts, investors, and other users of our financial statements may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies' reserves. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating us and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to its most comparable

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis, as well as other sections in this report, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Further, we encourage you to revisit the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this report.\nSUMMARY\n2016 Financial Overview of Operations and Liquidity\nProduction volumes increased to 22.2 MMBoe in 2016, including 0.2 MMBoe from our recent acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, compared to 15.4 MMBoe in 2015, representing an increase of 44 percent. The increase in production volumes was primarily attributable to our successful horizontal Niobrara and Codell drilling program in the Wattenberg Field. Crude oil production increased 25 percent in 2016, which comprised approximately 39 percent of total production. Natural gas production increased 55 percent and NGLs increased 70 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases were the result of our shift in focus to the higher rate of return drilling projects located in the higher gas to oil ratio inner and middle core areas of the Wattenberg Field during the first half of 2016. On a combined basis, total liquids production of crude oil and NGLs comprised 61 percent of production in 2016 compared to 64 percent of production in 2015, a decrease of four percent. For the month ended December 31, 2016, we maintained an average production rate of 73 MBoe per day, up from 52 MBoe per day for the month ended December 31, 2015.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales increased to $497.4 million in 2016 compared to $378.7 million in 2015, due to a 44 percent increase in production, offset in part by a nine percent decrease in the weighted-average realized prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, driven by lower commodity prices and changes in commodity mix. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales, coupled with the impact of positive net settlements of derivatives, also increased in 2016 as compared to 2015. When combining the physical commodity sales and the net settlements received on our commodity derivative instruments, the total net revenues increased 14 percent to $705.4 million in 2016 from $617.6 million in 2015. The low crude oil and natural gas index prices in 2016 and 2015 were the primary reason for the positive net settlements of $208.1 million and $238.9 million on commodity derivatives in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2016, we generated a net loss of $245.9 million, or $5.01 per diluted share. In the same period we generated $435.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, and invested $396.4 million in the development and exploration of our oil and natural gas properties, which is net of the change in accounts payable related to capital expenditures. Our cash flow from operations was $486.3 million and our adjusted cash flow from operations was $466.8 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash flow from operations are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures as defined and more fully described later in this section.\nOther significant changes impacting our 2016 results of operations include the following:\n \u2022 The net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions in 2016 was a loss of $333.8 million compared to a loss of $35.8 million in 2015. The decrease in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions is largely driven by the normal monthly settlements of the commodity derivative instruments in 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value was attributable to hedging positions entered into in 2016 at lower strike prices and the upward shift in the crude oil and natural gas forward curves that occurred during 2016 versus a downward shift in 2015. \n \u2022 Production tax expense increased to $31.4 million in 2016 from $18.4 million in 2015 due to increased production of 44 percent and higher overall sales proceeds. Additionally, we had a higher effective production tax rate in 2016 primarily from a reduction in ad valorem credits from the prior year to offset current year severance taxes due. \n \u2022 Impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties was $10.0 million in 2016 compared to $161.6 million in 2015. The 2016 impairments are a result of the write-off of certain leases that were no longer part of our development plan and to reflect the fair value of other land and buildings that are held for sale. The Utica Shale was the largest component of the 2015 write-down which included both producing and non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense increased to $112.5 million in 2016 compared to $90.0 million in 2015. The increase was attributable to professional and transaction fees related to the Delaware Basin acquisitions and increases in payroll and employee benefits, as we increased our staff by nine percent over the course of 2016. \n \u2022 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased to $416.9 million in 2016 compared to $303.3 million in 2015, due to the increase in production volumes from year to year. \n \u2022 We recorded a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.0 million in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a note receivable. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased to $62.0 million in 2016 from $47.6 million in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $9.3 million charge for the bridge loan commitment related to our initial Delaware Basin acquisition, a $7.4 million increase in interest expense resulting from the issuance of our 2024 Senior Notes, and a $2.9 million increase in interest expense for the issuance of our 2021 Convertible Notes in September 2016. The increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the net settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016. \nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2016 was $932.4 million compared to $402.2 million as of December 31, 2015. Available liquidity as of December 31, 2016 is comprised of $244.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $688.3 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. In December 2016, pursuant to an amendment to our credit facility and in conjunction with the closing of\nthe acquisitions of the Delaware Basin properties, we increased the aggregate commitment under our revolving credit facility from $450 million to $700 million.\nIn March 2016, we completed a public offering of 5.9 million shares of our common stock at a price to us of $50.11 per share. Net proceeds of the offering were $296.6 million, after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our revolving credit facility, the principal and interest owed upon the maturity of the $115 million face value of 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016 and for general corporate purposes. We settled the 2016 Convertible Notes with a combination of cash and stock, paying the aggregate principal amount, plus cash for fractional shares, totaling approximately $115 million. The conversion price for the 2016 Convertible Notes was $42.40 per share, resulting in the issuance of 792,406 shares of common stock for the excess conversion value.\nIn June 2016, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Energy Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (\"Noble\") to consolidate certain acreage positions in the core Wattenberg Field. In September 2016, we closed the acreage exchange transaction. Pursuant to the transaction, we exchanged leasehold acreage and, to a lesser extent, interests in certain development wells. Upon closing, we received approximately 13,500 net acres in exchange for approximately 11,700 net acres, with no cash exchanged between the parties. The difference in net acres was primarily due to variances in leasehold net revenue interests and third-party mid-stream contracts. This acreage trade has resulted in opportunities for longer length horizontal laterals with increased working interests, while minimizing potential surface impact.\nIn September 2016, we sold 9.1 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $558.5 million, we issued the 2024 Senior Notes for net proceeds of $392.2 million, and we issued the 2021 Convertible Senior Notes convertible at 11.7113 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount for net proceeds of $193.9 million (collectively, the \"Securities Issuances\"). The total net proceeds of $1.1 billion from the Securities Issuances were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions of the Delaware Basin properties, pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes.\nWe intend to continue to manage our liquidity position by a variety of means, including through the generation of cash flow from our operations, investment in projects with attractive rates of return, protection of cash flows on a portion of our anticipated sales through the use of an active commodity derivative program, utilization of our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, and the pursuit of capital markets transactions from time to time.\nDelaware Basin Acquisitions\nThrough a deliberate and disciplined process of searching for, and evaluating, a large-scale acquisition in a U.S. onshore basin that diversifies our operations and is capable of creating material long-term value-added growth, we recently acquired proved and unproved leasehold in the Delaware Basin in Reeves and Culberson Counties in Texas. The acquisition criteria focused on four key attributes:\n \u2022 top-tier acreage in core geologic positions; \n \u2022 significant drilling inventory with additional expansion through down spacing; \n \u2022 portfolio optionality for capital allocation and diversification; and \n \u2022 the ability to deliver long-term corporate accretion. \nWe believe the Delaware Basin acquisitions met these criteria.\nWe completed two acquisition transactions associated with the Delaware Basin. The first acquisition closed in early December 2016, and we acquired acreage, approximately 30 producing wells and related midstream infrastructure in Reeves and Culberson Counties, Texas, for an aggregate consideration to the sellers of approximately $1.64 billion, which was comprised of approximately $952.1 million in cash (including the repayment of $40.0 million of debt from the seller at closing) and 9.4 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $690.7 million at the time the acquisition closed. The total purchase price remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments as of the date of this report and we expect that it may take into mid-2017 until all post-closing adjustments are settled.\nThe acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, we conducted assessments of net assets acquired and recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values, while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred. The details of the purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the first transaction are presented below (in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cash, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retirement of seller's debt\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash consideration\n</td> <td>952,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Common stock, 9.4 million shares\n</td> <td>690,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other purchase price adjustments\n</td> <td>1,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total acquisition costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,643,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets acquired:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas properties - proved\n</td> <td>216,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas properties - unproved\n</td> <td>1,721,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure, pipeline, and other\n</td> <td>32,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction in progress\n</td> <td>12,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>62,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets acquired\n</td> <td>2,052,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current liabilities\n</td> <td>(24,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>(3,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax liabilities, net\n</td> <td>(379,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>(408,444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total identifiable net assets acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,643,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2016 results of operations of the acquired properties in the first transaction had a loss from operations of $1.7 million, which is included in our consolidated statements of operations for 2016.\nThe second transaction closed at the end of December 2016. In this transaction, we acquired primarily unproved acreage for cash consideration of $120.6 million. This acquisition is also subject to final settlement as there were some limited producing assets. The final settlement is not expected to be completed until mid-2017.\n2016 Drilling Overview\nDuring 2016, we continued to execute our strategic plan to grow production while preserving our financial strength and liquidity. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the Wattenberg Field. In August 2016, we decreased the number of automated drilling rigs to three in anticipation of higher working interests in wells drilled resulting from the acreage exchange. During 2016, we spud 128 gross horizontal, (109.4 net), wells and turned-in-line 140 gross, (109.7 net), horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field. Also in the Wattenberg Field, we participated in 17 gross (3.6 net) horizontal non-operated wells that were spud and 24 gross (5.0 net) horizontal non-operated wells which were turned-in-line. In the Utica Shale, we completed five gross horizontal (4.5 net) wells, all of which were turned-in-line in 2016. Following the closing of our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, we spud one well (0.9 net), and turned-in-line another well (1.0 net) prior to the end of 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our 2016 drilling and completion activity:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-process as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells spud during the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells turned-in-line to sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired in-process\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-process as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur in-process wells represent wells that are in the process of being drilled and/or have been drilled and are waiting to be fractured and/or for gas pipeline connection. We do not have a practice of inventorying our drilled but uncompleted wells. The majority of these in-process wells at each year end are drilled, but not completed as we do not begin the completion process until the entire well pad is drilled. All costs incurred through the end of the period have been capitalized or accrued to capital, while the capital investment to complete the wells will be incurred in the following year. The cost of completing these wells is included in our 2017 capital forecast.\n2017 Operational Outlook\nWe expect our production for 2017 to range between 30.0 MMBoe to 33.0 MMBoe and we estimate that our production rate will average approximately 82,200 to 90,400 Boe per day. We expect that 41 percent to 43 percent of our 2017 production will be comprised of crude oil and 20 percent to 22 percent will be NGLs, for total liquids of 61 percent to 65 percent of our total 2017 production. Our previously-announced 2017 capital forecast of between $725 million and $775 million is focused on continued development in the core Wattenberg Field and the integration of the core Delaware Basin assets. Due to recent cost escalation for services and the modification of our drilling schedule in the Delaware Basin, where we have accelerated the deployment of an additional drilling rig, we currently expect that our 2017 capital investment will be at or near the high end of the range. These changes to our capital investment outlook are not expected to impact our expected 2017 production as the incremental wells drilled are contemplated to be turned-in-line to sales late in the year.\nWattenberg Field. The 2017 investment outlook of approximately $470 million in the Wattenberg Field anticipates a three to four-rig drilling program based on our current commodity price outlook. Approximately $460 million of our 2017 capital investment program is expected to be allocated to development activities, comprised of approximately $440 million for our operated drilling program and approximately $20 million for wells drilled and operated by others. The remainder of the Wattenberg Field capital investment program is expected to be used for miscellaneous workover and capital projects. Wells in the Wattenberg Field typically have productive horizons at a depth of approximately 6,500 to 7,500 feet below the surface. In 2017, to help manage our priorities, we now anticipate spudding 137 and turning-in-line approximately 139 horizontal operated wells with lateral lengths of 5,000 to 10,000 feet.\nDelaware Basin. Our 2017 investment outlook contemplates operating a two-rig to four-rig program in the Delaware Basin from time to time during the year. Total capital investment in the Delaware Basin is estimated to be $300 million, of which approximately $235 million is allocated to spud 31 and turn-in-line an estimated 26 wells. Of the the 26 planned turn-in-lines, 14 are expected to have laterals of approximately 10,000 horizontal feet with an estimated 70 to 75 completion stages per well. Similarly spaced completion stages are anticipated for the remaining 12 turn-in-lines. Wells in the Delaware Basin typically have productive horizons at a depth of approximately 9,000 to 11,000 feet below the surface. Based on the timing of our operations and the requirements to hold acreage, we may adapt our capital investment program to drill wells in addition to those currently anticipated, as we are continuing to analyze terms of the leaseholds related to our recent acquisitions of properties in the basin. We plan to invest approximately $35 million for leasing, seismic, and technical studies with an additional $30 million for midstream-related projects including gas connections, salt water disposal wells, and surface location infrastructure.\nUtica Shale. At this time, we are currently evaluating all of our strategic alternatives with respect to our Utica Shale position. As a result of such evaluation, we are deferring our 2017 planned expenditure of $18 million to drill, complete, and turn-in-line two wells in Guernsey County. In 2017, our capital investment program for the Utica Shale is expected to include between $2 million to $3 million for additional leasing. Such leasing may be necessary to complete certain drilling operations if we decide to continue development of our existing position in the northern portion of our acreage.\nResults of

Crude oil production increased 25 percent in 2016, which comprised approximately 39 percent of total production. Natural gas production increased 55 percent and NGLs increased 70 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in crude oil are different from the comparative period because of our shift in focus to the higher rate of return drilling projects located in the higher gas to oil ratio inner and middle core areas of the Wattenberg Field during the first half of 2016. On a combined basis, total liquids production of crude oil and NGLs comprised 61 percent of production in 2016 compared to 64 percent of production in 2015, a decrease of four percent. Production volumes increased 65 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs was relatively consistent across commodities at 62 percent, 73 percent, and 61 percent, respectively, as we focused our 2015 and 2014 drilling on the middle and outer core areas of the Wattenberg Field. We currently expect our 2017 individual commodity growth and overall production growth to be similar.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in 2016 increased 31 percent compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes sold in 2016 of 22.2 MMBoe, up from 15.4 MMBoe in 2015. This was offset in part by a decrease in commodity prices and modest changes in the commodity mix, which resulted in a nine percent decline in the average realized price on a barrel of oil equivalent basis in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher volumes were primarily contributed from turning in-line to sales 140 new gross wells in the Wattenberg Field that delivered significant production volumes. Included in the 22.2 MMBoe is production of 0.2 MMBoe from our acquisitions of producing properties in the Delaware Basin. Our average daily sales volumes increased to 60.6 MBoe per day in 2016\ncompared to 42.1 MBoe per day in 2015 as a result of continued drilling and completion activities. The average NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices decreased by 11 percent and eight percent in 2016 compared to 2015. For crude oil the change was to $43.32 per barrel in 2016 from $48.80 per barrel in 2015, and we were able to offset the majority of the decrease in the NYMEX sales prices through actions that decreased our contractual deductions to $4.39 per barrel in 2016 from $9.95 per barrel in 2015. The natural gas realized sales price decreased more than the decrease in the NYMEX price because a portion of our deductions for natural gas are based on fixed price elements and have a more pronounced effect at lower prices.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in 2015 decreased 20 percent compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in commodity prices, resulting in a 51 percent decline in the price of a barrel of crude oil equivalent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was offset in part by the higher volumes sold in 2015 of 15.4 MMBoe, up from 9.3 MMBoe in 2014. Our average daily sales volumes increased to 42.1 MMBoe per day in 2015 compared to 25.5 MMBoe per day in 2014. The average NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices decreased by 47 percent and 40 percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring various times between 2012 and the summer of 2015, our production had been adversely affected by high line pressures in the natural gas gathering facilities in the Wattenberg Field. Such pressures did not materially affect our production during 2016 due to the investment in the midstream capabilities by our midstream providers and a decrease in development activity by certain producers in the Wattenberg Field resulting in more relative capacity being available to deliver our production. In 2016, approximately 90 percent of our production in the Wattenberg Field was delivered from horizontal wells, with the remaining 10 percent coming from vertical wells. The horizontal wells are less prone to issues than the vertical wells in that they are newer and have greater producing capacity and higher formation pressures and therefore tend to be more resilient from periodic gas system pressure issues.\nWe rely on our third-party midstream service providers to construct compression, gathering and processing facilities to keep pace with our, and the overall field's, production growth. We anticipate gathering system pressures to vary throughout the year, with increases coinciding with the warmer summer months. We, along with other operators in the Wattenberg Field, continue to work closely with our third-party midstream providers in an effort to ensure adequate system capacity going forward as evidenced by a recent commitment of DCP to build additional gathering and processing in the field. This expansion of gathering and processing facilities is expected to improve natural gas gathering pipelines and processing facilities and assist in the control of line pressures in the Wattenberg Field. However, the timing and availability of adequate infrastructure is not within our control and if our midstream provider's construction projects are delayed, we could experience higher line pressures that may negatively impact our ability to fulfill our growth plans. Total system infrastructure needs may also be affected by a number of factors, including potential increases in production from the Wattenberg Field and warmer than expected weather.\nCrude Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and our ability to market our production effectively. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have a high degree of volatility. While the price of crude oil decreased during the first half of 2016 compared to 2015, prices increased during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of the year as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016. Natural gas prices decreased during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to domestic oversupply driven by a lack of a normal winter withdrawal cycle in the winter of 2015-2016. We experienced improved NGL pricing towards the end of 2016; however, due to an oversupply of nearly all domestic NGLs products, our average realized sales price for NGLs during most of 2016 reflected the same depressed levels seen during 2015. With the initiation of ethane exports and increased domestic demand for NGLs driven by the completion of petrochemical processing plants, the industry is beginning to see NGL prices trend upward, including in the near term forward market.\nCrude Oil. Crude oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, financial markets, and national and international politics. In the Wattenberg Field, our crude oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly and longer term transportation provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials. We have entered into commitments ranging in term from one month to over three years to deliver crude oil to competitive markets, resulting in improved overall average deductions in 2016, as noted previously. We continue to pursue various alternatives with respect to oil transportation, particularly in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward further improving pricing and limiting our use of trucking through delivering greater quantities of our crude oil via pipeline to liquid markets. We began delivering crude oil in accordance with our long term commitment to the White Cliffs pipeline in July 2015. The White Cliffs agreement is one of several we have entered into to facilitate deliveries of a portion of our crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma market. In addition, to the White Cliffs agreement described above, we have signed a long-term agreement with Saddle Butte Rockies Midstream, LLC for gathering of crude oil at the wellhead by pipeline from several of our producing pads in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward minimizing truck traffic, increasing reliability, reducing the overall physical footprint of our well pads, and reducing emissions. We began delivering crude oil into this pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued to grow these volumes during 2016.\nIn the Delaware Basin, our crude oil production is sold at the wellhead and transported via trucks to pipelines that deliver the oil to the Midland, Texas, crude oil market. Given the increased level of activity in the form of acquisitions, leasing, and the increases in rig count in the Delaware Basin over the last six months, we expect the balance between production and pipeline takeaway capacity to tighten during 2017. At the current time, there are pipeline, truck and rail pathways out of the basin, all of which are available to us. We are evaluating near-term and longer-term solutions that contemplate the increased activity levels we expect, as well as our anticipated future production. These may include longer-term sales agreements.\nIn the Utica Shale, crude oil and condensate is sold to local purchasers at each individual pad based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials, and is typically transported by the purchasers via truck to local refineries, rail facilities, or barge loading terminals on the Ohio River. To date, we have not experienced any issues with takeaway capacity in this region for our crude oil.\nNatural Gas. Natural gas prices vary quite significantly by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity, and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on CIG pricing provisions or local distribution company monthly/daily pricing provisions, adjusted for certain deductions. Our natural gas from the Delaware Basin is sold into the Waha hub and El Paso index markets. Natural gas produced in the Utica Shale is sold based on TETCO M-2 pricing.\nNatural Gas Liquids. Our NGL sales are priced based upon the components of the product and are correlated to the price of crude oil. Our price for NGLs produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mt. Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed. While NGL prices remained low during the majority of 2016, we realized improvements in NGL pricing during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are seeing this improvement continue in early 2017. Given the lack of liquidity in the forward markets, it is unclear if this trend will continue. Delaware Basin NGLs sales are indexed to NYMEX and sold into the Mt. Belvieu, Texas market. The NGLs produced in the Utica Shale are sold based on month-to-month pricing to various markets.\nOur crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales are recorded under either the net-back\u201d or \"gross\" method of accounting, depending upon the related purchase agreement. We use the \"net-back\" method of accounting for natural gas and NGLs, as well as the majority of our crude oil production from the Wattenberg Field, for all commodities in the Delaware Basin, and for crude oil from the Utica Shale as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide transportation, gathering, and processing services. In these situations, the purchaser pays us proceeds based on a percent of the proceeds, or have fixed our sales price at index less a specified deduction. We sell our commodities at the wellhead or what is tantamount to the wellhead in situations where we gather multiple wells into larger pads, and collect a price and recognize revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and therefore embedded in the wellhead price. The \"net-back\" method results in the recognition of a net sales price that is lower than the indices for which the production is based because the operating costs and profit of the midstream facilities are embedded in the net price we earn. We use the \"gross\" method of accounting for Wattenberg Field crude oil delivered through the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines, and for natural gas and NGLs sales related to production from the Utica Shale as the purchasers do not provide transportation, gathering or processing services as a function of the price we earn. Rather, we contract separately with the midstream provider for the applicable transport and processing based on a per unit basis. Under this method, we recognize revenues based on the gross selling price and recognize transportation, gathering, and processing expenses. As a result of the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte agreements, during 2016 and 2015, our Wattenberg Field crude oil average sales price increased approximately $1.60 and $0.73, respectively, per barrel, relative to the benchmark price because we recognized the costs for transportation on the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines as an increase in revenues and transportation expense, rather than as a deduction from revenues.\nLease Operating Expenses\nLease operating expenses were $60.0 million in 2016 compared to $57.0 million in 2015. Due to newer and more horizontal well completions that deliver larger volumes of production per well than older vertical wells, we are seeing the lease operating costs spread over more volume, resulting in lower lease operating cost per Boe. This is reflected in the fact that our per Boe lease operating expense decreased by 27 percent to $2.70 for 2016 from $3.71 for 2015. The $3.0 million increase in the total lease operating expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million for increases in wages and employee benefits related to an increase in headcount, including costs for additional contract labor, $1.8 million for additional leased compressors to address line pressures, and an increase of $1.5 million related to lease operating expenses for the acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects of $3.2 million due to a reduction in new remediation projects, and a decrease of $1.4 million related to fewer workover and maintenance related projects. With our entry into the Delaware Basin, we anticipate that our per Boe lease operating cost will be higher initially as we have limited wells and production over which to apply our lease operating costs. With time, we expect that the lease operating costs per Boe in the Delaware Basin will improve.\nLease operating expenses were $57.0 million in 2015 compared to $42.4 million in 2014. The $14.6 million increase in lease operating expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million for environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects due to increases in the number of projects and an increase in per project expenses, an increase of $3.4 million for additional wages and employee benefits primarily due to additional headcount, including costs for additional contract labor, $2.0 million for additional workover and maintenance related projects, $1.4 million for additional compressors to correct high line pressures in the Wattenberg Field, $1.0 million for the increasing number of non-operated wells in the Wattenberg Field, and $0.9 million for additional costs pertaining to water hauling and disposal. Lease operating expenses per Boe decreased significantly to $3.71 for 2015 from $4.56 in 2014, as a result of increased production.\nProduction Taxes\nProduction taxes are directly related to crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales. Production taxes are comprised of both statutory severance tax rates as well as ad valorem tax rates for the applicable production periods. There are a number of adjustments to the statutory rates based on certain credits that are determined based on activity levels and relative commodity prices from year-to-year. The $13.0 million, or 70 percent, increase in production taxes for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to the 31 percent increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales, higher ad valorem mill rates, and an overall higher effective tax rate resulting from a decrease in ad valorem tax credits available from the prior year to offset current year severance taxes, driven by the relatively depressed commodity pricing in 2015. These items resulted in effective production tax rates of 6.3 percent and 4.9 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Similarly, the $7.2 million, or 28 percent, decrease in production taxes for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily related to the 20 percent decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales.\nOn a per Boe basis, the increase in rates in 2016 impacted the production tax expense, which increased to $1.42 for 2016 compared to $1.20 for 2015 due to the higher effective tax rate noted above. With the decrease in commodity pricing for 2015, production taxes per Boe decreased to $1.20 for 2015 compared to $2.76 for 2014. These items resulted in effective production tax rates of 4.9 percent and 5.4 percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTransportation, Gathering and Processing Expenses\nThe $8.3 million, or 81 percent, increase in transportation, gathering, and processing expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 was mainly attributable to the costs associated with the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines in the Wattenberg Field as we began delivering crude oil on these pipelines in July 2015 and December 2015, respectively. We expect to continue to incur these oil transportation costs pursuant to our long-term firm transportation agreement for 6,600 gross barrels per day. The $5.6 million, or 121 percent, increase in transportation, gathering, and processing expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly attributable to costs associated with the White Cliffs pipeline. Transportation, gathering, and processing expenses per Boe increased to $0.83 for 2016 compared to $0.66 for 2015 and $0.49 for 2014. By using these pipelines and having the pipelines be able to deliver product to the Cushing, Oklahoma market, we benefit from the liquidity associated with the purchasers' delivery point.\nCommodity Price Risk Management, Net\nWe use commodity derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. We have in place a variety of collars, fixed-price swaps, and basis swaps on a portion of our estimated crude oil and natural gas production. Because we sell all of our crude oil and natural gas production at prices related to the indexes inherent in our underlying derivative instruments, we ultimately realize value related to our collars of no less than the floor and no more than the ceiling and, for our commodity swaps, we ultimately realize the fixed price value related to our swaps.\nCommodity price risk management, net, includes cash settlements upon maturity of our derivative instruments and the change in fair value of unsettled derivatives related to our crude oil and natural gas production. Commodity price risk management, net, does not include derivative transactions related to our gas marketing, which are included in sales from and cost of gas marketing.\nNet settlements of commodity derivative instruments are based on the difference between the crude oil, natural gas and natural gas index prices at the settlement date of our commodity derivative instruments compared to the respective strike prices contracted for the settlement months that were established at the time we entered into the commodity derivative transaction. The net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives is comprised of the net value increase or decrease in the beginning-of-period fair value of commodity derivative instruments that settled during the period, and the net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives during the period or from inception of any new contracts entered into during the applicable period. The corresponding impact of settlement of the commodity derivative instruments during the period is included in net settlements for the period as discussed above. The net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives during the period is primarily related to shifts in the crude oil and natural gas forward curves and changes in certain differentials.\nThe following table presents net settlements and net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives included in commodity price risk management, net:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity price risk management gain (loss), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net settlements of commodity derivative instruments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas basis protection swaps\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net settlements of commodity derivative instruments\n</td> <td>208.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivative instruments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of settlements included in prior period changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments\n</td> <td>(220.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>(78.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas fixed price swaps and collars\n</td> <td>(37.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas basis swaps\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivative instruments\n</td> <td>(333.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commodity price risk management gain (loss), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExploration Expense\nThe following table presents the major components of exploration expense:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic purchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, personnel and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total exploration expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeological and geophysical costs.

As a result of our assessments, we recorded impairment charges of $150.3 million and $158.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down our Utica Shale proved and unproved properties. Of these impairment charges, $24.7 million and $112.6 million were recorded in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down certain capitalized well costs on our Utica Shale proved producing properties. In 2015 and 2014, we also recorded\nimpairment charges of $125.6 million and $45.7 million to write-down our Utica Shale lease acquisition costs. The impairment charges, which are included in the consolidated statements of operations line item impairment of properties and equipment, represented the amount by which the carrying value of these crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair values. We continued to monitor whether any further impairments were triggered and required measurement throughout 2016 given the continued volatility of commodity prices and the continued capital investment in the development and acquisition of oil and gas properties. No such triggering events occurred during 2016. Impairment charges in 2016 relate to the retirement of certain leases that were no longer part of our development plan and to reflect the fair value of other property and equipment that was held for sale as of December 31, 2016. Future deterioration of commodity prices or other operating circumstances could result in additional impairment charges to our properties and equipment.\nAmortization of individually insignificant unproved properties. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 is due to the impairment of leases in 2015, which significantly reduced total lease costs. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to a higher number of insignificant leases that were subject to amortization in 2015, primarily in the Utica Shale.\nLand and buildings. The impairment charge for 2016 represents the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value, less the cost to sell, of a field operating facility in Greeley, Colorado, and 12 acres of land located adjacent to our Bridgeport, West Virginia, regional headquarters. The fair values of these assets were determined based upon estimated future cash flows from unrelated third-party bids.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $22.5 million, or 25 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in cash based general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to $12.2 million of legal and professional fees related to the acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, a $7.7 million increase in payroll and employee benefits due to per capita increases in wages and increases in headcount given the increase in our personnel by nine percent over the course of 2016. Stock-based compensation expense in 2016 and 2015 was $19.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $33.6 million, or 27 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to $40.3 million recorded in 2014 in connection with certain partnership-related class action litigation and estimates relating to litigation arising from bankruptcy proceedings of certain affiliated partnerships and a $1.8 million decrease in costs for legal and other professional services in 2015. The decreases were offset in part by an $8.2 million increase in payroll and employee benefits in 2015, of which $3.3 million was related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2014 was $20.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\nCrude oil and natural gas properties. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, we invested $396.4 million, $554.3 million and $663.4 million, which is net of the change in accounts payable related to capital expenditures, in the development of our oil and natural gas properties, respectively. We also incurred $1.76 billion to acquire proved reserves during 2016. We did not invest in any acquisitions of proved reserves in 2015 or 2014. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties is directly related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties was $413.1 million, $298.8 million, and $188.5 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year change in DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties were primarily due to the following:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in weighted-average depreciation, depletion and amortization rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents our DD&A expense rates for crude oil and natural gas properties:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Region/Area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(per Boe)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wattenberg Field\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delaware Basin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utica Shale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total weighted-average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2016 rate for the Delaware Basin is related to our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. The slight decrease in the Wattenberg Field rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of our 2016 year-end reserves. The decrease in the Utica Shale DD&A expense rates in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to the effect of impairments recorded in 2015 and 2014 to write-down certain capitalized well costs on our Utica Shale proved producing properties.\nProvision for Uncollectible Notes Receivable\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.7 million to impair two third-party notes receivable whose collection was not reasonably assured. Later in 2016, we collected a $0.7 million promissory note and reversed the related provision and allowance for uncollectible notes receivable.\nAccretion of Asset Retirement Obligations\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\") for 2016 increased by $0.8 million, or 13 percent, compared to 2015, and increased by $2.9 million, or 84 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due to adding new wells and the associated increase in amortization expense. The increase in 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the estimated useful life of certain vertical wells in the Wattenberg Field.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $14.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $9.3 million charge for the bridge loan commitment related to acquisitions of properties in the Delaware Basin, a $7.4 million increase in interest for the issuance of our 2024 Senior Notes, and a $2.9 million increase in interest expense for the issuance of our 2021 Convertible Notes in September 2016. The increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the net settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016. The entire $9.3 million of interest expense attributed to the bridge loan facility was expensed in 2016 as the bridge loan was replaced with equity and longer term debt financing.\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $0.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease is primarily comprised of a $1.6 million decrease attributable to an increase in capitalized interest, offset in part by a $0.9 million increase due to higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2015.\nInterest costs capitalized in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $4.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.5 million, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe current income tax benefit (expense) in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $9.9 million, $(3.1) million, and $(0.5) million, respectively. Current income taxes generally relate to the cash that is paid or recovered for income taxes associated with the applicable period. The remaining portion of the total income tax expense is comprised of deferred income tax expense (benefit), which is a result of differences in the timing of deductions for our GAAP presentation of financial statements and the income tax regulations.\nFor 2016, 2015, and 2014, the effective income tax rate (the \"rate\") of 37.4 percent, 35.9 percent, and 39.5 percent on income (loss) from operations differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to state taxes and excess stock compensation benefits, offset by nondeductible expenses that consist primarily of officers' compensation cost and government lobbying expenses.\nAs of the date of this report, we are current with our income tax filings in all applicable state jurisdictions. We continue to voluntarily participate in the Internal Revenue Service's (\"IRS\") Compliance Assurance Program (the \"CAP Program\") for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years. We have received a full acceptance notice from the IRS for our filed 2015 federal tax return and the IRS's post filing review is complete.\nWe acquired a net deferred tax liability of $379.9 million in 2016 associated with a lack of tax basis relative to the purchase price of one of the Delaware Basin acquisitions. This has resulted in a material increase in our deferred tax liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nThere has been increased discussion by the federal government of a potential reduction of the corporate income tax rate and corresponding changes to the tax code. In the event of a change in federal or state income tax rates, the impact of the rate change will be required to be recorded through deferred income tax expense. Should statutory income tax rates decrease, our deferred tax liability would decrease, resulting in deferred tax benefit for the period. If the statutory income tax rates increase, our deferred tax liability would increase resulting in a deferred tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAppalachian Marcellus Shale Assets. In October 2014, we completed the sale of our entire 50 percent ownership interest in PDCM to an unrelated third-party for aggregate consideration, after our share of PDCM's debt repayment and other working capital adjustments, of approximately $192.0 million, comprised of approximately $152.8 million in net cash proceeds and a promissory note due in 2020 of approximately $39.0 million. The transaction included the buyer's assumption of our share of the firm transportation commitment related to the assets owned by PDCM, as well as our share of PDCM's natural gas hedging positions in effect at the time. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $76.3 million. The divestiture represented a strategic shift in our operations. Accordingly, our proportionate share of PDCM's Marcellus Shale results of operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for 2014 and prior periods in the Selected Financial Information disclosures.\nNet Income (Loss)/Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nThe factors resulting in changes in net loss in 2016 and 2015 compared to net income in 2014 are discussed above. These same reasons similarly impacted adjusted net income (loss), a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, with the exception of the net change in fair value of unsettled derivatives, adjusted for taxes, of $208.9 million, $22.2 million, and $193.1 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Adjusted net loss, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was $37.0 million, $46.1 million, and $37.7 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, below, for a more detailed discussion of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, our revolving credit facility, proceeds raised in debt, and equity capital market transactions and asset sales. In 2016, our primary sources of liquidity were net cash flows from operating activities of $486.3 million, the net proceeds received from the March 2016 public offering of our common stock of approximately $296.6 million, and the net proceeds from the Securities Issuances of approximately $1.1 billion.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the March 2016 common stock offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our revolving credit facility and the principal amount owed upon the maturity of the 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the Securities Issuances were used to fund a portion of the purchase price and related fees for acquisitions in the Delaware Basin and for general corporate purposes.\nOur primary source of cash flows from operating activities is the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Fluctuations in our operating cash flows are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and we partially manage this volatility through our use of commodity derivative instruments. In 2016 and 2015, net settled commodity derivatives comprised approximately 43 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of our cash flows from operating activities. Based upon our hedge position and assuming year-end forward strip pricing, in 2017 and thereafter our derivatives may not be a significant source of cash flow, and may result in cash outflows in 2017 and 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our derivatives was a net liability of $70.0 million. Based on the forward pricing strip at December 31, 2016, we would expect negative net settlements totaling approximately $45 million during 2017.\nThe covenants under our revolving credit agreement limit the volume of our expected future production that we may hedge. However, we may enter into commodity derivative instruments with future settlement periods of up to sixty months from the date of issuance of the commodity derivative instrument. We do not have minimum hedging requirements associated with our revolving credit facility.\nOur net working capital fluctuates for various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments and changes in our cash and cash equivalents due to our historical practice of utilizing excess cash to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility when we have borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital surplus of $129.2 million compared to a surplus of $30.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in working capital is primarily the result of an increase of $243.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the $112.9 million reduction in the current portion of long-term debt due to the settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016, and no current amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016, partially offset by a negative change in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments of $264.9 million from 2015 to 2016. The net cash position was a result of the Securities Issuances and our desire to have cash available to fund the portion of the 2017 capital investment program that is expected to exceed operating cash flows.\nWe ended 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $244.1 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $688.3 million, providing for a total liquidity position of $932.4 million, compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2015. The change in liquidity of $530.2 million, or 131.8 percent, was primarily attributable to:\n\u2022net cash flows from operating activities of $486.3 million;\n\u2022net proceeds received from the March 2016 public offering of our common stock of approximately $296.6 million;\n\u2022net proceeds from the Securities Issuances of approximately $1.1 billion; offset in part by,\n\u2022cash outflows for capital investments associated with development, exploration, and acquisition activity of\n$1.76 billion during 2016; and\n\u2022cash payment of approximately $115 million upon the maturity of our Convertible Notes in May 2016.\nBased on our expectations of cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalent balance and availability under our revolving credit facility, we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our planned activities during 2017.\nIn March 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. Effective upon filing, the shelf provides for the potential sale of an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by depository shares, warrants or purchase contracts, as well as units that may include any of these securities or securities of other entities. The shelf registration statement is intended to allow us to be proactive in our ability to raise capital and to have the flexibility to raise such funds in one or more offerings should we perceive market conditions to be favorable. We have utilized the shelf registration statement to raise capital from time to time, and we may utilize the facility in the future to raise additional capital.\nOur revolving credit facility is a borrowing base facility and availability under the facility is subject to redetermination each May and November, based upon a quantification of our proved reserves at each June 30 and December 31, respectively. In September 2016, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, amended the revolving credit facility to permit the completion of acquisitions in the Delaware Basin and, effective upon closing of the acquisitions, adjusted the interest rate payable on amounts borrowed under the facility, increased the aggregate commitments under the facility from $450 million to $700 million, and reduced our maximum leverage ratio to 4.00:1.00 times as described in more detail below. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is May 2020. In October 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, reaffirmed our borrowing base at $700 million and, increased the percentage of our\nfuture production that we are permitted to hedge. Our borrowing base availability under the revolving credit facility is limited under our 2022 Senior Notes to the greater of $700 million or the calculated value under an Adjusted Consolidated Tangible Net Asset test, as defined.\nOur borrowings bear interest at either the LIBOR or prime rate plus an applicable margin, depending on the percentage of the commitment that has been utilized as of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin is 1.25%, and the unused commitment fee is 0.50%.\nWe had no balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, RNG had issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit of approximately $11.7 million in favor of a third-party transportation service provider to secure firm transportation of the natural gas produced by third-party producers for whom we market production in the Appalachian Basin. The letter of credit expires in September 2017 and is automatically extended annually in accordance with the letter of credit's terms and conditions. The letter of credit reduces the amount of available funds under our revolving credit facility by an amount equal to the letter of credit. While we have added and expect to continue to add producing reserves through our drilling operations, the effect of any such reserve additions on our borrowing base could be offset by other factors including, among other things, a prolonged period of depressed commodity prices or regulatory pressure on lenders to reduce their exposure to exploration and production companies.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. The covenants require that we maintain: (i) total debt of less than 4.00 times the trailing 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives, exploration expense, gains (losses) on sales of assets and other non-cash, gains (losses) (\"EBITDAX\"), and (ii) an adjusted current ratio of at least 1.00:1.00. Our adjusted current ratio is adjusted by eliminating the impact on our current assets and liabilities of recording the fair value of crude oil and natural gas commodity derivative instruments. Additionally, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are added to the current asset calculation and the current portion of our revolving credit facility debt is eliminated from the current liabilities calculation. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants with a 2.10 times debt to EBITDAX ratio and a 5.00:1.00 current ratio. We expect to remain in compliance into the foreseeable future.\nThe indentures governing our 2024 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes contain customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (a) incur additional debt including limitations as to availability under our revolving credit facility, (b) make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase, redeem, or retire capital stock, (c) sell assets, including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries, (d) restrict the payment of dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to us, (e) create liens that secure debt, (f) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (g) merge or consolidate with another company. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance into the foreseeable future.\nIn January 2017, pursuant to the filing of the supplemental indentures for the 1.25% convertible senior notes due in 2021 (\"2021 Convertible Senior Notes\"), the 2024 Senior Notes, and the 2022 Senior Notes, our subsidiary PDC Permian, Inc., became a guarantor of the notes.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Our net cash flows from operating activities are primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, net settlements from our commodity derivative positions, operating costs, and general and administrative expenses. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015. The $75.2 million increase was primarily due to the increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $118.7 million. We also realized an increase in the change of funds held for future distribution of $36.5 million, and an increase in the deferral of income taxes of $13.1 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in monthly derivative commodity settlements of $30.8 million, and increases in general and administrative expense of $22.5 million, interest expense of $14.4 million, production taxes of $13.0 million and transportation, gathering, and processing expenses of $8.3 million.\nCash flows provided by operating activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014. The $174.4 million increase was primarily due to the increase in normal monthly derivative commodity settlements of $241.0 million and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $33.6 million and production taxes of $7.2 million. The increase was offset by the decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $92.7 million and an increase in lease operating costs of $14.6 million.\nAdjusted cash flows from operations, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, increased by $46.0 million in 2016 to $466.8 million, and $170.6 million to $420.8 million in 2015, when compared to the respective prior years. These changes were primarily due to the same factors mentioned above for changes in cash flows provided by operating activities, without regard to timing of cash payments and/or receipts of our assets and liabilities of $19.5 million and $9.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, decreased by $7.6 million in 2016 to $435.6 million from $443.2 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.0 million, the decrease in net settlements from our monthly derivative commodity settlements of $30.8 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $22.5 million, and a $27.8 million increase in production and exploration expense. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $118.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $78.9 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in normal monthly derivative commodity settlements of $241.0 million and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $33.6 million. The increase was partially\noffset by the decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $92.7 million, and an $88.8 million decrease in contribution margins from discontinued operations and a $14.6 million increase in lease operating costs.\nInvesting Activities. Because crude oil and natural gas production from a well declines rapidly in the first few years of production, we need to continue to invest significant amounts of capital in order to maintain and grow our production and replace our reserves. If capital markets are not available in the future, we will be limited to our cash flows from operations and liquidity under our revolving credit facility as the sources for funding our capital investments.\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consist of the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, net of dispositions of crude oil and natural gas properties. During 2016, our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin comprised the majority of our cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in the Delaware Basin acquisitions was $1.1 billion and we used cash of $436.9 million for our oil and gas operations. Our total cash used in investing activities during 2016 was approximately $1.5 billion. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the Wattenberg Field. In August 2016, we decreased the number of automated drilling rigs to three in anticipation of higher working interests in wells drilled resulting from an acreage exchange. In the Utica Shale, we drilled and completed five gross (4.5 net) wells, all of which were turned-in-line to sales in 2016. With the closing of our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, we completed the drilling of two wells that were in-process at closing, spud an additional well, and turned-in-line one well prior to the end of 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $604.3 million during 2015 was primarily related to cash utilized for our drilling operations. Net cash used in investing activities of $474.1 million during 2014 was primarily related to cash utilized for our drilling operations of $623.8 million, offset in part by the $152.8 million net cash proceeds received from the sale of our entire 50 percent ownership interest in PDCM.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash from financing activities in 2016 was primarily related to the $855.1 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of 9.4 million shares of our common stock, $392.2 million of net proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Senior Notes and $193.9 million of net proceeds from issuance of the 2021 Convertible Notes, partially offset by the $115 million payment owed upon the maturity of the 2016 Convertible Notes and net payments of approximately $37.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility.\nNet cash from financing activities in 2015 was primarily related to $202.9 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock in March 2015, partially offset by net payments of approximately $19.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Net cash from financing activities in 2014 were primarily comprised of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $63.8 million to execute our capital budget.\nContractual Obligations and

$143.5 million, due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. \n (2) Amount presented does not agree with the consolidated balance sheets in that it excludes $37.5 million of unamortized debt discount and $18.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. \n (3) Represents our gross liability related to the fair value of derivative positions. \n (4) Short-term capital lease obligations are included in other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \n (5) Includes deferred compensation to former executive officers and deferred payments related to firm transportation agreements. \n (6) Table does not include an undrawn $11.7 million irrevocable standby letter of credit pending issuance to a transportation service provider. Additionally, the table does not include the annual repurchase obligations to investing partners or termination benefits related to employment agreements with our executive officers, due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. \n (7) Amounts presented include $224.4 million to the holders of our 2022 Senior Notes, $188.7 million to the holders of our 2024 Senior Notes, and $115.2 million payable to the holders of our 2021 Convertible Notes. Amounts also include $11.0 million payable to the participating banks in our revolving credit facility, of which interest of $9.0 million is related to unutilized commitments at a rate of 0.38% per annum, and $0.2 million is related to our undrawn letters of credit. \n (8) Represents our gross commitment which includes volumes produced by us, purchased from third parties and produced by our affiliated partnerships and other third-party working, royalty and overriding royalty interest owners whose volumes we market on their behalf. This includes anticipated and estimated commitments associated with a new gas processing facility by our primary mid-stream provider. The timing of such payments has been estimated and is subject to change based on the completion of construction and the commencing of operations by the midstream provider. \nAs the managing general partner of affiliated partnerships, we have liability for potential casualty losses in excess of the partnership assets and insurance. We believe that the casualty insurance coverage we and our subcontractors carry is adequate to meet this potential liability.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation that we believe would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the following policies as critical to business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. This is not a comprehensive list of all of the accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with no need for our judgment in the application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and we may use significant judgment in the application. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on historical experience, observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the footnote titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Properties. We account for our crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of proved developed producing properties, successful exploratory wells and developmental dry hole costs are capitalized and depreciated or depleted by the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed producing reserves. Property acquisition costs are depreciated or depleted on the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves.\nAnnually, we engage independent petroleum engineers to prepare reserve and economic evaluations of all our properties on a well-by-well basis as of December 31. We adjust our crude oil and natural gas reserves for major acquisitions, new drilling, and divestitures during the year as needed. The process of estimating and evaluating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, revisions in existing reserve estimates occur. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent our most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates over time. Because estimates of reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense, a change in our estimated reserves could have an effect on our net income (loss).\nExploration costs, including geological and geophysical expenses, the acquisition of seismic data covering unproved acreage,\nand delay rentals, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory well drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if the well is determined to be nonproductive. The status of each in-progress well is reviewed quarterly to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting. Exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized as long as the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and we are making sufficient progress assessing our reserves and economic and operating viability. If an in-progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful prior to the issuance of the financial statements, the costs incurred prior to the end of the reporting period are charged to exploration expense. If we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of the financial statements, the well is classified as \"suspended well costs\" until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations to evaluate the pertinent geological and engineering data obtained. At the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well's productive status, the well is removed from the suspended well status and the proper accounting treatment is applied.\nThe acquisition costs of unproved properties are capitalized when incurred, until such properties are transferred to proved properties or charged to expense when expired, impaired, or amortized. Unproved crude oil and natural gas properties with individually significant acquisition costs are periodically assessed, and any impairment in value is charged to impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The\namount of impairment recognized on unproved properties which are not individually significant is determined by amortizing the costs of such properties within appropriate fields based on our historical experience, acquisition dates and average lease terms, with the amortization recognized in impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The valuation of unproved properties is subjective and requires us to make estimates and assumptions which, with the passage of time, may prove to be materially different from actual realizable values.\nWe assess our crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment upon a triggering event or when circumstances warrant\nby comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a field-by-field basis using estimated production based upon prices at which we reasonably estimate the commodity to be sold. Any impairment in value is charged to impairment of properties and equipment. The estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Any downward revisions in estimates to our reserve quantities, expectations of falling commodity prices, or rising operating costs could result in a triggering event, and therefore, a reduction in undiscounted future net cash flows and an impairment of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Although our cash flow estimates are based on the relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nCrude Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Sales Revenue Recognition. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a determinable price, delivery has occurred, rights and responsibility of ownership have transferred and collection of revenue is reasonably assured. We record sales revenue based on an estimate of the volumes delivered at estimated prices as determined by the applicable sales agreement. We estimate our sales volumes based on company-measured volume readings. We then adjust our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in subsequent periods based on the data received from our purchasers that reflects actual volumes and prices received. We receive payment for sales from one to two months after actual delivery has occurred. The differences in sales estimates and actual sales are recorded one to two months later. Historically, these differences have been immaterial. If a sale is deemed uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful collection is recorded.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Our fair value measurements are estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity.\nCommodity Derivative Financial Instruments. We measure the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments based on a pricing model that utilizes market-based inputs, including but not limited to the contractual price of the underlying position, current market prices, natural gas, and crude oil forward curves, discount rates such as the LIBOR curve for a similar duration of each outstanding position, volatility factors and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of our credit standing on the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities and the effect of our counterparties' credit standings on the fair value of commodity derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding commodity derivative position.\nWe validate our fair value measurement through the review of counterparty statements and other supporting documentation, the determination that the source of the inputs is valid, the corroboration of the original source of inputs through access to multiple quotes, if available, or other information and monitoring changes in valuation methods and assumptions. While we use common industry practices to develop our valuation techniques, changes in our pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values. While we believe our valuation method is appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of a different methodology, or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.\nNet settlements on our commodity derivative instruments are initially recorded to accounts receivable or payable, as applicable, and may not be received from or paid to counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts within the same accounting period. Such settlements typically occur the month following the maturity of the commodity derivative instrument. We have evaluated the credit risk of the counterparties holding our commodity derivative assets, which are primarily financial institutions who are also major lenders in our revolving credit facility, giving consideration to amounts outstanding for each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding commodity derivative position. Based on our evaluation, we have determined that the potential impact of nonperformance of our counterparties on the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments is not significant.\nDeferred Income Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax asset is not expected to be realized under the preceding criteria, we establish a valuation allowance. The factors which we consider in assessing whether we will realize the value of deferred income tax assets involve judgments and estimates of both amount and timing. The judgments used in applying these policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for Business Combinations. We utilize the purchase method to account for acquisitions of businesses and assets. The value of the purchase consideration takes into account the degree to which the consideration is objective and measurable such as cash consideration paid to a seller. With the issuance of equity, restrictions upon the sale of the issued stock are taken into consideration. Pursuant to purchase method accounting, we allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocations are based on appraisals, discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates by management. When appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of crude oil and natural gas properties within the same regions and use that data as a basis for fair market value as such sales represent the amount at which a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties.\nIn estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved developed producing, proved developed non-producing, proved undeveloped and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties, and other non-crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves. When appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of crude oil and natural gas properties within the same regions and use that data as a basis for fair market value; for example, the amount at which a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties. We estimate future prices by using the applicable forward pricing strip to apply to our estimate of reserve quantities acquired, and estimates of future operating and development costs, to arrive at an estimate of future net revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues are discounted using a market-based weighted-average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted-average cost of capital rate is subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties, we reduce the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves by additional risk-weighting factors.\nWe record deferred taxes for any differences between the assigned values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee the footnote titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted cash flows from operations. We define adjusted cash flows from operations as the cash flows earned or incurred from operating activities, without regard to changes in operating assets and liabilities. We believe it is important to consider adjusted cash flows from operations, as well as cash flows from operations, as we believe it often provides more transparency into what drives the changes in our operating trends, such as production, prices, operating costs, and related operational factors, without regard to whether the related asset or liability was received or paid during the same period. We also use this measure because the timing of cash received from our assets, cash paid to obtain an asset or payment of our obligations has been only a timing issue from one period to the next as we have not had accounts receivable collection problems, nor been unable to purchase assets or pay our obligations.\nAdjusted net income (loss). We define adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives, each adjusted for tax effects. We believe it is important to consider adjusted net income (loss), as well as net income (loss). We believe this measure often provides more transparency into our operating trends, such as production, prices, operating costs, net settlements from derivatives and related factors, without regard to changes in our net income (loss) from mark-to-market adjustments resulting from net changes in the fair value of unsettled derivatives. Additionally, other items which we believe are not indicative of future results may be excluded to clearly identify operating trends.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives, interest expense, net of interest income, income taxes, impairment of properties and equipment, depreciation, depletion, and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), nor as an indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA includes certain non-cash costs incurred by us and does not take into account changes in operating assets and liabilities. Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA is relevant because it is a measure of our operational and financial performance, as well as a measure of our liquidity, and is used by our management, investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others that utilize our financial statements to analyze such things as:\n \u2022 operating performance and return on capital as compared to our peers; \n \u2022 financial performance of our assets and our valuation without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations and commitments; and \n \u2022 viability of acquisition opportunities and capital investment projects, including the related rate of return. \nPV-10. We define PV-10 as the estimated present value of the future net cash flows from our proved reserves before income taxes, discounted using a 10 percent discount rate. We believe that PV-10 provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. We believe that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our reserves. Professional analysts, investors, and other users of our financial statements may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies' reserves. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating us and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to its most comparable

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis, as well as other sections in this report, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Further, we encourage you to revisit the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this report.\nSUMMARY\n2016 Financial Overview of Operations and Liquidity\nProduction volumes increased to 22.2 MMBoe in 2016, including 0.2 MMBoe from our recent acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, compared to 15.4 MMBoe in 2015, representing an increase of 44 percent. The increase in production volumes was primarily attributable to our successful horizontal Niobrara and Codell drilling program in the Wattenberg Field. Crude oil production increased 25 percent in 2016, which comprised approximately 39 percent of total production. Natural gas production increased 55 percent and NGLs increased 70 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases were the result of our shift in focus to the higher rate of return drilling projects located in the higher gas to oil ratio inner and middle core areas of the Wattenberg Field during the first half of 2016. On a combined basis, total liquids production of crude oil and NGLs comprised 61 percent of production in 2016 compared to 64 percent of production in 2015, a decrease of four percent. For the month ended December 31, 2016, we maintained an average production rate of 73 MBoe per day, up from 52 MBoe per day for the month ended December 31, 2015.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales increased to $497.4 million in 2016 compared to $378.7 million in 2015, due to a 44 percent increase in production, offset in part by a nine percent decrease in the weighted-average realized prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, driven by lower commodity prices and changes in commodity mix. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales, coupled with the impact of positive net settlements of derivatives, also increased in 2016 as compared to 2015. When combining the physical commodity sales and the net settlements received on our commodity derivative instruments, the total net revenues increased 14 percent to $705.4 million in 2016 from $617.6 million in 2015. The low crude oil and natural gas index prices in 2016 and 2015 were the primary reason for the positive net settlements of $208.1 million and $238.9 million on commodity derivatives in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2016, we generated a net loss of $245.9 million, or $5.01 per diluted share. In the same period we generated $435.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, and invested $396.4 million in the development and exploration of our oil and natural gas properties, which is net of the change in accounts payable related to capital expenditures. Our cash flow from operations was $486.3 million and our adjusted cash flow from operations was $466.8 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash flow from operations are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures as defined and more fully described later in this section.\nOther significant changes impacting our 2016 results of operations include the following:\n \u2022 The net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions in 2016 was a loss of $333.8 million compared to a loss of $35.8 million in 2015. The decrease in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions is largely driven by the normal monthly settlements of the commodity derivative instruments in 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value was attributable to hedging positions entered into in 2016 at lower strike prices and the upward shift in the crude oil and natural gas forward curves that occurred during 2016 versus a downward shift in 2015. \n \u2022 Production tax expense increased to $31.4 million in 2016 from $18.4 million in 2015 due to increased production of 44 percent and higher overall sales proceeds. Additionally, we had a higher effective production tax rate in 2016 primarily from a reduction in ad valorem credits from the prior year to offset current year severance taxes due. \n \u2022 Impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties was $10.0 million in 2016 compared to $161.6 million in 2015. The 2016 impairments are a result of the write-off of certain leases that were no longer part of our development plan and to reflect the fair value of other land and buildings that are held for sale. The Utica Shale was the largest component of the 2015 write-down which included both producing and non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense increased to $112.5 million in 2016 compared to $90.0 million in 2015. The increase was attributable to professional and transaction fees related to the Delaware Basin acquisitions and increases in payroll and employee benefits, as we increased our staff by nine percent over the course of 2016. \n \u2022 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased to $416.9 million in 2016 compared to $303.3 million in 2015, due to the increase in production volumes from year to year. \n \u2022 We recorded a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.0 million in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a note receivable. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased to $62.0 million in 2016 from $47.6 million in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $9.3 million charge for the bridge loan commitment related to our initial Delaware Basin acquisition, a $7.4 million increase in interest expense resulting from the issuance of our 2024 Senior Notes, and a $2.9 million increase in interest expense for the issuance of our 2021 Convertible Notes in September 2016. The increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the net settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016. \nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2016 was $932.4 million compared to $402.2 million as of December 31, 2015. Available liquidity as of December 31, 2016 is comprised of $244.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $688.3 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. In December 2016, pursuant to an amendment to our credit facility and in conjunction with the closing of\nthe acquisitions of the Delaware Basin properties, we increased the aggregate commitment under our revolving credit facility from $450 million to $700 million.\nIn March 2016, we completed a public offering of 5.9 million shares of our common stock at a price to us of $50.11 per share. Net proceeds of the offering were $296.6 million, after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our revolving credit facility, the principal and interest owed upon the maturity of the $115 million face value of 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016 and for general corporate purposes. We settled the 2016 Convertible Notes with a combination of cash and stock, paying the aggregate principal amount, plus cash for fractional shares, totaling approximately $115 million. The conversion price for the 2016 Convertible Notes was $42.40 per share, resulting in the issuance of 792,406 shares of common stock for the excess conversion value.\nIn June 2016, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Energy Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (\"Noble\") to consolidate certain acreage positions in the core Wattenberg Field. In September 2016, we closed the acreage exchange transaction. Pursuant to the transaction, we exchanged leasehold acreage and, to a lesser extent, interests in certain development wells. Upon closing, we received approximately 13,500 net acres in exchange for approximately 11,700 net acres, with no cash exchanged between the parties. The difference in net acres was primarily due to variances in leasehold net revenue interests and third-party mid-stream contracts. This acreage trade has resulted in opportunities for longer length horizontal laterals with increased working interests, while minimizing potential surface impact.\nIn September 2016, we sold 9.1 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $558.5 million, we issued the 2024 Senior Notes for net proceeds of $392.2 million, and we issued the 2021 Convertible Senior Notes convertible at 11.7113 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount for net proceeds of $193.9 million (collectively, the \"Securities Issuances\"). The total net proceeds of $1.1 billion from the Securities Issuances were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions of the Delaware Basin properties, pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes.\nWe intend to continue to manage our liquidity position by a variety of means, including through the generation of cash flow from our operations, investment in projects with attractive rates of return, protection of cash flows on a portion of our anticipated sales through the use of an active commodity derivative program, utilization of our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, and the pursuit of capital markets transactions from time to time.\nDelaware Basin Acquisitions\nThrough a deliberate and disciplined process of searching for, and evaluating, a large-scale acquisition in a U.S. onshore basin that diversifies our operations and is capable of creating material long-term value-added growth, we recently acquired proved and unproved leasehold in the Delaware Basin in Reeves and Culberson Counties in Texas. The acquisition criteria focused on four key attributes:\n \u2022 top-tier acreage in core geologic positions; \n \u2022 significant drilling inventory with additional expansion through down spacing; \n \u2022 portfolio optionality for capital allocation and diversification; and \n \u2022 the ability to deliver long-term corporate accretion. \nWe believe the Delaware Basin acquisitions met these criteria.\nWe completed two acquisition transactions associated with the Delaware Basin. The first acquisition closed in early December 2016, and we acquired acreage, approximately 30 producing wells and related midstream infrastructure in Reeves and Culberson Counties, Texas, for an aggregate consideration to the sellers of approximately $1.64 billion, which was comprised of approximately $952.1 million in cash (including the repayment of $40.0 million of debt from the seller at closing) and 9.4 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $690.7 million at the time the acquisition closed. The total purchase price remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments as of the date of this report and we expect that it may take into mid-2017 until all post-closing adjustments are settled.\nThe acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, we conducted assessments of net assets acquired and recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values, while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred. The details of the purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the first transaction are presented below (in thousands):\n\nThe 2016 results of operations of the acquired properties in the first transaction had a loss from operations of $1.7 million, which is included in our consolidated statements of operations for 2016.\nThe second transaction closed at the end of December 2016. In this transaction, we acquired primarily unproved acreage for cash consideration of $120.6 million. This acquisition is also subject to final settlement as there were some limited producing assets. The final settlement is not expected to be completed until mid-2017.\n2016 Drilling Overview\nDuring 2016, we continued to execute our strategic plan to grow production while preserving our financial strength and liquidity. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the Wattenberg Field. In August 2016, we decreased the number of automated drilling rigs to three in anticipation of higher working interests in wells drilled resulting from the acreage exchange. During 2016, we spud 128 gross horizontal, (109.4 net), wells and turned-in-line 140 gross, (109.7 net), horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field. Also in the Wattenberg Field, we participated in 17 gross (3.6 net) horizontal non-operated wells that were spud and 24 gross (5.0 net) horizontal non-operated wells which were turned-in-line. In the Utica Shale, we completed five gross horizontal (4.5 net) wells, all of which were turned-in-line in 2016. Following the closing of our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, we spud one well (0.9 net), and turned-in-line another well (1.0 net) prior to the end of 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our 2016 drilling and completion activity:\n\nOur in-process wells represent wells that are in the process of being drilled and/or have been drilled and are waiting to be fractured and/or for gas pipeline connection. We do not have a practice of inventorying our drilled but uncompleted wells. The majority of these in-process wells at each year end are drilled, but not completed as we do not begin the completion process until the entire well pad is drilled. All costs incurred through the end of the period have been capitalized or accrued to capital, while the capital investment to complete the wells will be incurred in the following year. The cost of completing these wells is included in our 2017 capital forecast.\n2017 Operational Outlook\nWe expect our production for 2017 to range between 30.0 MMBoe to 33.0 MMBoe and we estimate that our production rate will average approximately 82,200 to 90,400 Boe per day. We expect that 41 percent to 43 percent of our 2017 production will be comprised of crude oil and 20 percent to 22 percent will be NGLs, for total liquids of 61 percent to 65 percent of our total 2017 production. Our previously-announced 2017 capital forecast of between $725 million and $775 million is focused on continued development in the core Wattenberg Field and the integration of the core Delaware Basin assets. Due to recent cost escalation for services and the modification of our drilling schedule in the Delaware Basin, where we have accelerated the deployment of an additional drilling rig, we currently expect that our 2017 capital investment will be at or near the high end of the range. These changes to our capital investment outlook are not expected to impact our expected 2017 production as the incremental wells drilled are contemplated to be turned-in-line to sales late in the year.\nWattenberg Field. The 2017 investment outlook of approximately $470 million in the Wattenberg Field anticipates a three to four-rig drilling program based on our current commodity price outlook. Approximately $460 million of our 2017 capital investment program is expected to be allocated to development activities, comprised of approximately $440 million for our operated drilling program and approximately $20 million for wells drilled and operated by others. The remainder of the Wattenberg Field capital investment program is expected to be used for miscellaneous workover and capital projects. Wells in the Wattenberg Field typically have productive horizons at a depth of approximately 6,500 to 7,500 feet below the surface. In 2017, to help manage our priorities, we now anticipate spudding 137 and turning-in-line approximately 139 horizontal operated wells with lateral lengths of 5,000 to 10,000 feet.\nDelaware Basin. Our 2017 investment outlook contemplates operating a two-rig to four-rig program in the Delaware Basin from time to time during the year. Total capital investment in the Delaware Basin is estimated to be $300 million, of which approximately $235 million is allocated to spud 31 and turn-in-line an estimated 26 wells. Of the the 26 planned turn-in-lines, 14 are expected to have laterals of approximately 10,000 horizontal feet with an estimated 70 to 75 completion stages per well. Similarly spaced completion stages are anticipated for the remaining 12 turn-in-lines. Wells in the Delaware Basin typically have productive horizons at a depth of approximately 9,000 to 11,000 feet below the surface. Based on the timing of our operations and the requirements to hold acreage, we may adapt our capital investment program to drill wells in addition to those currently anticipated, as we are continuing to analyze terms of the leaseholds related to our recent acquisitions of properties in the basin. We plan to invest approximately $35 million for leasing, seismic, and technical studies with an additional $30 million for midstream-related projects including gas connections, salt water disposal wells, and surface location infrastructure.\nUtica Shale. At this time, we are currently evaluating all of our strategic alternatives with respect to our Utica Shale position. As a result of such evaluation, we are deferring our 2017 planned expenditure of $18 million to drill, complete, and turn-in-line two wells in Guernsey County. In 2017, our capital investment program for the Utica Shale is expected to include between $2 million to $3 million for additional leasing. Such leasing may be necessary to complete certain drilling operations if we decide to continue development of our existing position in the northern portion of our acreage.\nResults of Operations\nSummary Operating Results\nThe following table presents selected information regarding our operating results from continuing operations:\n\n * Percentage change is not meaningful or equal to or greater than 300% or not applicable.

Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.\n\n(1) Reflects the Delaware Basin acquisitions that occurred in December 2016.\n * Percentage change is not meaningful or equal to or greater than 300%.  Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.\nThe year-over-year change in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales revenue were primarily due to the following:\n\nProduction volumes increased 44 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Crude oil production increased 25 percent in 2016, which comprised approximately 39 percent of total production. Natural gas production increased 55 percent and NGLs increased 70 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in crude oil are different from the comparative period because of our shift in focus to the higher rate of return drilling projects located in the higher gas to oil ratio inner and middle core areas of the Wattenberg Field during the first half of 2016. On a combined basis, total liquids production of crude oil and NGLs comprised 61 percent of production in 2016 compared to 64 percent of production in 2015, a decrease of four percent. Production volumes increased 65 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs was relatively consistent across commodities at 62 percent, 73 percent, and 61 percent, respectively, as we focused our 2015 and 2014 drilling on the middle and outer core areas of the Wattenberg Field. We currently expect our 2017 individual commodity growth and overall production growth to be similar.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in 2016 increased 31 percent compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes sold in 2016 of 22.2 MMBoe, up from 15.4 MMBoe in 2015. This was offset in part by a decrease in commodity prices and modest changes in the commodity mix, which resulted in a nine percent decline in the average realized price on a barrel of oil equivalent basis in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher volumes were primarily contributed from turning in-line to sales 140 new gross wells in the Wattenberg Field that delivered significant production volumes. Included in the 22.2 MMBoe is production of 0.2 MMBoe from our acquisitions of producing properties in the Delaware Basin. Our average daily sales volumes increased to 60.6 MBoe per day in 2016\ncompared to 42.1 MBoe per day in 2015 as a result of continued drilling and completion activities. The average NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices decreased by 11 percent and eight percent in 2016 compared to 2015. For crude oil the change was to $43.32 per barrel in 2016 from $48.80 per barrel in 2015, and we were able to offset the majority of the decrease in the NYMEX sales prices through actions that decreased our contractual deductions to $4.39 per barrel in 2016 from $9.95 per barrel in 2015. The natural gas realized sales price decreased more than the decrease in the NYMEX price because a portion of our deductions for natural gas are based on fixed price elements and have a more pronounced effect at lower prices.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in 2015 decreased 20 percent compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in commodity prices, resulting in a 51 percent decline in the price of a barrel of crude oil equivalent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was offset in part by the higher volumes sold in 2015 of 15.4 MMBoe, up from 9.3 MMBoe in 2014. Our average daily sales volumes increased to 42.1 MMBoe per day in 2015 compared to 25.5 MMBoe per day in 2014. The average NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices decreased by 47 percent and 40 percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring various times between 2012 and the summer of 2015, our production had been adversely affected by high line pressures in the natural gas gathering facilities in the Wattenberg Field. Such pressures did not materially affect our production during 2016 due to the investment in the midstream capabilities by our midstream providers and a decrease in development activity by certain producers in the Wattenberg Field resulting in more relative capacity being available to deliver our production. In 2016, approximately 90 percent of our production in the Wattenberg Field was delivered from horizontal wells, with the remaining 10 percent coming from vertical wells. The horizontal wells are less prone to issues than the vertical wells in that they are newer and have greater producing capacity and higher formation pressures and therefore tend to be more resilient from periodic gas system pressure issues.\nWe rely on our third-party midstream service providers to construct compression, gathering and processing facilities to keep pace with our, and the overall field's, production growth. We anticipate gathering system pressures to vary throughout the year, with increases coinciding with the warmer summer months. We, along with other operators in the Wattenberg Field, continue to work closely with our third-party midstream providers in an effort to ensure adequate system capacity going forward as evidenced by a recent commitment of DCP to build additional gathering and processing in the field. This expansion of gathering and processing facilities is expected to improve natural gas gathering pipelines and processing facilities and assist in the control of line pressures in the Wattenberg Field. However, the timing and availability of adequate infrastructure is not within our control and if our midstream provider's construction projects are delayed, we could experience higher line pressures that may negatively impact our ability to fulfill our growth plans. Total system infrastructure needs may also be affected by a number of factors, including potential increases in production from the Wattenberg Field and warmer than expected weather.\nCrude Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and our ability to market our production effectively. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have a high degree of volatility. While the price of crude oil decreased during the first half of 2016 compared to 2015, prices increased during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of the year as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016. Natural gas prices decreased during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to domestic oversupply driven by a lack of a normal winter withdrawal cycle in the winter of 2015-2016. We experienced improved NGL pricing towards the end of 2016; however, due to an oversupply of nearly all domestic NGLs products, our average realized sales price for NGLs during most of 2016 reflected the same depressed levels seen during 2015. With the initiation of ethane exports and increased domestic demand for NGLs driven by the completion of petrochemical processing plants, the industry is beginning to see NGL prices trend upward, including in the near term forward market.\nCrude Oil. Crude oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, financial markets, and national and international politics. In the Wattenberg Field, our crude oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly and longer term transportation provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials. We have entered into commitments ranging in term from one month to over three years to deliver crude oil to competitive markets, resulting in improved overall average deductions in 2016, as noted previously. We continue to pursue various alternatives with respect to oil transportation, particularly in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward further improving pricing and limiting our use of trucking through delivering greater quantities of our crude oil via pipeline to liquid markets. We began delivering crude oil in accordance with our long term commitment to the White Cliffs pipeline in July 2015. The White Cliffs agreement is one of several we have entered into to facilitate deliveries of a portion of our crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma market. In addition, to the White Cliffs agreement described above, we have signed a long-term agreement with Saddle Butte Rockies Midstream, LLC for gathering of crude oil at the wellhead by pipeline from several of our producing pads in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward minimizing truck traffic, increasing reliability, reducing the overall physical footprint of our well pads, and reducing emissions. We began delivering crude oil into this pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued to grow these volumes during 2016.\nIn the Delaware Basin, our crude oil production is sold at the wellhead and transported via trucks to pipelines that deliver the oil to the Midland, Texas, crude oil market. Given the increased level of activity in the form of acquisitions, leasing, and the increases in rig count in the Delaware Basin over the last six months, we expect the balance between production and pipeline takeaway capacity to tighten during 2017. At the current time, there are pipeline, truck and rail pathways out of the basin, all of which are available to us. We are evaluating near-term and longer-term solutions that contemplate the increased activity levels we expect, as well as our anticipated future production. These may include longer-term sales agreements.\nIn the Utica Shale, crude oil and condensate is sold to local purchasers at each individual pad based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials, and is typically transported by the purchasers via truck to local refineries, rail facilities, or barge loading terminals on the Ohio River. To date, we have not experienced any issues with takeaway capacity in this region for our crude oil.\nNatural Gas. Natural gas prices vary quite significantly by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity, and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on CIG pricing provisions or local distribution company monthly/daily pricing provisions, adjusted for certain deductions. Our natural gas from the Delaware Basin is sold into the Waha hub and El Paso index markets. Natural gas produced in the Utica Shale is sold based on TETCO M-2 pricing.\nNatural Gas Liquids. Our NGL sales are priced based upon the components of the product and are correlated to the price of crude oil. Our price for NGLs produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mt. Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed. While NGL prices remained low during the majority of 2016, we realized improvements in NGL pricing during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are seeing this improvement continue in early 2017. Given the lack of liquidity in the forward markets, it is unclear if this trend will continue. Delaware Basin NGLs sales are indexed to NYMEX and sold into the Mt. Belvieu, Texas market. The NGLs produced in the Utica Shale are sold based on month-to-month pricing to various markets.\nOur crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales are recorded under either the net-back\u201d or \"gross\" method of accounting, depending upon the related purchase agreement. We use the \"net-back\" method of accounting for natural gas and NGLs, as well as the majority of our crude oil production from the Wattenberg Field, for all commodities in the Delaware Basin, and for crude oil from the Utica Shale as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide transportation, gathering, and processing services. In these situations, the purchaser pays us proceeds based on a percent of the proceeds, or have fixed our sales price at index less a specified deduction. We sell our commodities at the wellhead or what is tantamount to the wellhead in situations where we gather multiple wells into larger pads, and collect a price and recognize revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and therefore embedded in the wellhead price. The \"net-back\" method results in the recognition of a net sales price that is lower than the indices for which the production is based because the operating costs and profit of the midstream facilities are embedded in the net price we earn. We use the \"gross\" method of accounting for Wattenberg Field crude oil delivered through the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines, and for natural gas and NGLs sales related to production from the Utica Shale as the purchasers do not provide transportation, gathering or processing services as a function of the price we earn. Rather, we contract separately with the midstream provider for the applicable transport and processing based on a per unit basis. Under this method, we recognize revenues based on the gross selling price and recognize transportation, gathering, and processing expenses. As a result of the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte agreements, during 2016 and 2015, our Wattenberg Field crude oil average sales price increased approximately $1.60 and $0.73, respectively, per barrel, relative to the benchmark price because we recognized the costs for transportation on the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines as an increase in revenues and transportation expense, rather than as a deduction from revenues.\nLease Operating Expenses\nLease operating expenses were $60.0 million in 2016 compared to $57.0 million in 2015. Due to newer and more horizontal well completions that deliver larger volumes of production per well than older vertical wells, we are seeing the lease operating costs spread over more volume, resulting in lower lease operating cost per Boe. This is reflected in the fact that our per Boe lease operating expense decreased by 27 percent to $2.70 for 2016 from $3.71 for 2015. The $3.0 million increase in the total lease operating expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million for increases in wages and employee benefits related to an increase in headcount, including costs for additional contract labor, $1.8 million for additional leased compressors to address line pressures, and an increase of $1.5 million related to lease operating expenses for the acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects of $3.2 million due to a reduction in new remediation projects, and a decrease of $1.4 million related to fewer workover and maintenance related projects. With our entry into the Delaware Basin, we anticipate that our per Boe lease operating cost will be higher initially as we have limited wells and production over which to apply our lease operating costs. With time, we expect that the lease operating costs per Boe in the Delaware Basin will improve.\nLease operating expenses were $57.0 million in 2015 compared to $42.4 million in 2014. The $14.6 million increase in lease operating expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million for environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects due to increases in the number of projects and an increase in per project expenses, an increase of $3.4 million for additional wages and employee benefits primarily due to additional headcount, including costs for additional contract labor, $2.0 million for additional workover and maintenance related projects, $1.4 million for additional compressors to correct high line pressures in the Wattenberg Field, $1.0 million for the increasing number of non-operated wells in the Wattenberg Field, and $0.9 million for additional costs pertaining to water hauling and disposal. Lease operating expenses per Boe decreased significantly to $3.71 for 2015 from $4.56 in 2014, as a result of increased production.\nProduction Taxes\nProduction taxes are directly related to crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales. Production taxes are comprised of both statutory severance tax rates as well as ad valorem tax rates for the applicable production periods. There are a number of adjustments to the statutory rates based on certain credits that are determined based on activity levels and relative commodity prices from year-to-year. The $13.0 million, or 70 percent, increase in production taxes for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to the 31 percent increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales, higher ad valorem mill rates, and an overall higher effective tax rate resulting from a decrease in ad valorem tax credits available from the prior year to offset current year severance taxes, driven by the relatively depressed commodity pricing in 2015. These items resulted in effective production tax rates of 6.3 percent and 4.9 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Similarly, the $7.2 million, or 28 percent, decrease in production taxes for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily related to the 20 percent decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales.\nOn a per Boe basis, the increase in rates in 2016 impacted the production tax expense, which increased to $1.42 for 2016 compared to $1.20 for 2015 due to the higher effective tax rate noted above. With the decrease in commodity pricing for 2015, production taxes per Boe decreased to $1.20 for 2015 compared to $2.76 for 2014. These items resulted in effective production tax rates of 4.9 percent and 5.4 percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTransportation, Gathering and Processing Expenses\nThe $8.3 million, or 81 percent, increase in transportation, gathering, and processing expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 was mainly attributable to the costs associated with the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines in the Wattenberg Field as we began delivering crude oil on these pipelines in July 2015 and December 2015, respectively. We expect to continue to incur these oil transportation costs pursuant to our long-term firm transportation agreement for 6,600 gross barrels per day. The $5.6 million, or 121 percent, increase in transportation, gathering, and processing expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly attributable to costs associated with the White Cliffs pipeline. Transportation, gathering, and processing expenses per Boe increased to $0.83 for 2016 compared to $0.66 for 2015 and $0.49 for 2014. By using these pipelines and having the pipelines be able to deliver product to the Cushing, Oklahoma market, we benefit from the liquidity associated with the purchasers' delivery point.\nCommodity Price Risk Management, Net\nWe use commodity derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. We have in place a variety of collars, fixed-price swaps, and basis swaps on a portion of our estimated crude oil and natural gas production. Because we sell all of our crude oil and natural gas production at prices related to the indexes inherent in our underlying derivative instruments, we ultimately realize value related to our collars of no less than the floor and no more than the ceiling and, for our commodity swaps, we ultimately realize the fixed price value related to our swaps.\nCommodity price risk management, net, includes cash settlements upon maturity of our derivative instruments and the change in fair value of unsettled derivatives related to our crude oil and natural gas production. Commodity price risk management, net, does not include derivative transactions related to our gas marketing, which are included in sales from and cost of gas marketing.\nNet settlements of commodity derivative instruments are based on the difference between the crude oil, natural gas and natural gas index prices at the settlement date of our commodity derivative instruments compared to the respective strike prices contracted for the settlement months that were established at the time we entered into the commodity derivative transaction. The net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives is comprised of the net value increase or decrease in the beginning-of-period fair value of commodity derivative instruments that settled during the period, and the net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives during the period or from inception of any new contracts entered into during the applicable period. The corresponding impact of settlement of the commodity derivative instruments during the period is included in net settlements for the period as discussed above. The net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives during the period is primarily related to shifts in the crude oil and natural gas forward curves and changes in certain differentials.\nThe following table presents net settlements and net change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives included in commodity price risk management, net:\n\nExploration Expense\nThe following table presents the major components of exploration expense:\n\nGeological and geophysical costs. Geological and geophysical costs in 2016 were primarily related to the portion of the purchase of seismic data related to unproved acreage in the Delaware Basin.\nImpairment of Properties and Equipment\nThe following table sets forth the major components of our impairments of properties and equipment expense:\n\nDue to a significant decline in commodity prices and decreases in our net realized sales prices, we experienced triggering events during 2015 and 2014 that required us to assess our crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. As a result of our assessments, we recorded impairment charges of $150.3 million and $158.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down our Utica Shale proved and unproved properties. Of these impairment charges, $24.7 million and $112.6 million were recorded in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down certain capitalized well costs on our Utica Shale proved producing properties. In 2015 and 2014, we also recorded\nimpairment charges of $125.6 million and $45.7 million to write-down our Utica Shale lease acquisition costs. The impairment charges, which are included in the consolidated statements of operations line item impairment of properties and equipment, represented the amount by which the carrying value of these crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair values. We continued to monitor whether any further impairments were triggered and required measurement throughout 2016 given the continued volatility of commodity prices and the continued capital investment in the development and acquisition of oil and gas properties. No such triggering events occurred during 2016. Impairment charges in 2016 relate to the retirement of certain leases that were no longer part of our development plan and to reflect the fair value of other property and equipment that was held for sale as of December 31, 2016. Future deterioration of commodity prices or other operating circumstances could result in additional impairment charges to our properties and equipment.\nAmortization of individually insignificant unproved properties. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 is due to the impairment of leases in 2015, which significantly reduced total lease costs. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to a higher number of insignificant leases that were subject to amortization in 2015, primarily in the Utica Shale.\nLand and buildings. The impairment charge for 2016 represents the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value, less the cost to sell, of a field operating facility in Greeley, Colorado, and 12 acres of land located adjacent to our Bridgeport, West Virginia, regional headquarters. The fair values of these assets were determined based upon estimated future cash flows from unrelated third-party bids.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $22.5 million, or 25 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in cash based general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to $12.2 million of legal and professional fees related to the acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, a $7.7 million increase in payroll and employee benefits due to per capita increases in wages and increases in headcount given the increase in our personnel by nine percent over the course of 2016. Stock-based compensation expense in 2016 and 2015 was $19.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $33.6 million, or 27 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to $40.3 million recorded in 2014 in connection with certain partnership-related class action litigation and estimates relating to litigation arising from bankruptcy proceedings of certain affiliated partnerships and a $1.8 million decrease in costs for legal and other professional services in 2015. The decreases were offset in part by an $8.2 million increase in payroll and employee benefits in 2015, of which $3.3 million was related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2014 was $20.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\nCrude oil and natural gas properties. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, we invested $396.4 million, $554.3 million and $663.4 million, which is net of the change in accounts payable related to capital expenditures, in the development of our oil and natural gas properties, respectively. We also incurred $1.76 billion to acquire proved reserves during 2016. We did not invest in any acquisitions of proved reserves in 2015 or 2014. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties is directly related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties was $413.1 million, $298.8 million, and $188.5 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year change in DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties were primarily due to the following:\n\nThe following table presents our DD&A expense rates for crude oil and natural gas properties:\n\nThe 2016 rate for the Delaware Basin is related to our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. The slight decrease in the Wattenberg Field rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of our 2016 year-end reserves. The decrease in the Utica Shale DD&A expense rates in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to the effect of impairments recorded in 2015 and 2014 to write-down certain capitalized well costs on our Utica Shale proved producing properties.\nProvision for Uncollectible Notes Receivable\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.7 million to impair two third-party notes receivable whose collection was not reasonably assured. Later in 2016, we collected a $0.7 million promissory note and reversed the related provision and allowance for uncollectible notes receivable.\nAccretion of Asset Retirement Obligations\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\") for 2016 increased by $0.8 million, or 13 percent, compared to 2015, and increased by $2.9 million, or 84 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due to adding new wells and the associated increase in amortization expense. The increase in 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the estimated useful life of certain vertical wells in the Wattenberg Field.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $14.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $9.3 million charge for the bridge loan commitment related to acquisitions of properties in the Delaware Basin, a $7.4 million increase in interest for the issuance of our 2024 Senior Notes, and a $2.9 million increase in interest expense for the issuance of our 2021 Convertible Notes in September 2016. The increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the net settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016. The entire $9.3 million of interest expense attributed to the bridge loan facility was expensed in 2016 as the bridge loan was replaced with equity and longer term debt financing.\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $0.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease is primarily comprised of a $1.6 million decrease attributable to an increase in capitalized interest, offset in part by a $0.9 million increase due to higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2015.\nInterest costs capitalized in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $4.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.5 million, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe current income tax benefit (expense) in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $9.9 million, $(3.1) million, and $(0.5) million, respectively. Current income taxes generally relate to the cash that is paid or recovered for income taxes associated with the applicable period. The remaining portion of the total income tax expense is comprised of deferred income tax expense (benefit), which is a result of differences in the timing of deductions for our GAAP presentation of financial statements and the income tax regulations.\nFor 2016, 2015, and 2014, the effective income tax rate (the \"rate\") of 37.4 percent, 35.9 percent, and 39.5 percent on income (loss) from operations differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to state taxes and excess stock compensation benefits, offset by nondeductible expenses that consist primarily of officers' compensation cost and government lobbying expenses.\nAs of the date of this report, we are current with our income tax filings in all applicable state jurisdictions. We continue to voluntarily participate in the Internal Revenue Service's (\"IRS\") Compliance Assurance Program (the \"CAP Program\") for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years. We have received a full acceptance notice from the IRS for our filed 2015 federal tax return and the IRS's post filing review is complete.\nWe acquired a net deferred tax liability of $379.9 million in 2016 associated with a lack of tax basis relative to the purchase price of one of the Delaware Basin acquisitions. This has resulted in a material increase in our deferred tax liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nThere has been increased discussion by the federal government of a potential reduction of the corporate income tax rate and corresponding changes to the tax code. In the event of a change in federal or state income tax rates, the impact of the rate change will be required to be recorded through deferred income tax expense. Should statutory income tax rates decrease, our deferred tax liability would decrease, resulting in deferred tax benefit for the period. If the statutory income tax rates increase, our deferred tax liability would increase resulting in a deferred tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAppalachian Marcellus Shale Assets. In October 2014, we completed the sale of our entire 50 percent ownership interest in PDCM to an unrelated third-party for aggregate consideration, after our share of PDCM's debt repayment and other working capital adjustments, of approximately $192.0 million, comprised of approximately $152.8 million in net cash proceeds and a promissory note due in 2020 of approximately $39.0 million. The transaction included the buyer's assumption of our share of the firm transportation commitment related to the assets owned by PDCM, as well as our share of PDCM's natural gas hedging positions in effect at the time. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $76.3 million. The divestiture represented a strategic shift in our operations. Accordingly, our proportionate share of PDCM's Marcellus Shale results of operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for 2014 and prior periods in the Selected Financial Information disclosures.\nNet Income (Loss)/Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nThe factors resulting in changes in net loss in 2016 and 2015 compared to net income in 2014 are discussed above. These same reasons similarly impacted adjusted net income (loss), a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, with the exception of the net change in fair value of unsettled derivatives, adjusted for taxes, of $208.9 million, $22.2 million, and $193.1 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Adjusted net loss, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was $37.0 million, $46.1 million, and $37.7 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, below, for a more detailed discussion of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, our revolving credit facility, proceeds raised in debt, and equity capital market transactions and asset sales. In 2016, our primary sources of liquidity were net cash flows from operating activities of $486.3 million, the net proceeds received from the March 2016 public offering of our common stock of approximately $296.6 million, and the net proceeds from the Securities Issuances of approximately $1.1 billion.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the March 2016 common stock offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our revolving credit facility and the principal amount owed upon the maturity of the 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the Securities Issuances were used to fund a portion of the purchase price and related fees for acquisitions in the Delaware Basin and for general corporate purposes.\nOur primary source of cash flows from operating activities is the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Fluctuations in our operating cash flows are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and we partially manage this volatility through our use of commodity derivative instruments. In 2016 and 2015, net settled commodity derivatives comprised approximately 43 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of our cash flows from operating activities. Based upon our hedge position and assuming year-end forward strip pricing, in 2017 and thereafter our derivatives may not be a significant source of cash flow, and may result in cash outflows in 2017 and 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our derivatives was a net liability of $70.0 million. Based on the forward pricing strip at December 31, 2016, we would expect negative net settlements totaling approximately $45 million during 2017.\nThe covenants under our revolving credit agreement limit the volume of our expected future production that we may hedge. However, we may enter into commodity derivative instruments with future settlement periods of up to sixty months from the date of issuance of the commodity derivative instrument. We do not have minimum hedging requirements associated with our revolving credit facility.\nOur net working capital fluctuates for various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments and changes in our cash and cash equivalents due to our historical practice of utilizing excess cash to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility when we have borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital surplus of $129.2 million compared to a surplus of $30.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in working capital is primarily the result of an increase of $243.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the $112.9 million reduction in the current portion of long-term debt due to the settlement of our 2016 Convertible Notes in May 2016, and no current amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016, partially offset by a negative change in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments of $264.9 million from 2015 to 2016. The net cash position was a result of the Securities Issuances and our desire to have cash available to fund the portion of the 2017 capital investment program that is expected to exceed operating cash flows.\nWe ended 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $244.1 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $688.3 million, providing for a total liquidity position of $932.4 million, compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2015. The change in liquidity of $530.2 million, or 131.8 percent, was primarily attributable to:\n\u2022net cash flows from operating activities of $486.3 million;\n\u2022net proceeds received from the March 2016 public offering of our common stock of approximately $296.6 million;\n\u2022net proceeds from the Securities Issuances of approximately $1.1 billion; offset in part by,\n\u2022cash outflows for capital investments associated with development, exploration, and acquisition activity of\n$1.76 billion during 2016; and\n\u2022cash payment of approximately $115 million upon the maturity of our Convertible Notes in May 2016.\nBased on our expectations of cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalent balance and availability under our revolving credit facility, we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our planned activities during 2017.\nIn March 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. Effective upon filing, the shelf provides for the potential sale of an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by depository shares, warrants or purchase contracts, as well as units that may include any of these securities or securities of other entities. The shelf registration statement is intended to allow us to be proactive in our ability to raise capital and to have the flexibility to raise such funds in one or more offerings should we perceive market conditions to be favorable. We have utilized the shelf registration statement to raise capital from time to time, and we may utilize the facility in the future to raise additional capital.\nOur revolving credit facility is a borrowing base facility and availability under the facility is subject to redetermination each May and November, based upon a quantification of our proved reserves at each June 30 and December 31, respectively. In September 2016, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, amended the revolving credit facility to permit the completion of acquisitions in the Delaware Basin and, effective upon closing of the acquisitions, adjusted the interest rate payable on amounts borrowed under the facility, increased the aggregate commitments under the facility from $450 million to $700 million, and reduced our maximum leverage ratio to 4.00:1.00 times as described in more detail below. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is May 2020. In October 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, reaffirmed our borrowing base at $700 million and, increased the percentage of our\nfuture production that we are permitted to hedge. Our borrowing base availability under the revolving credit facility is limited under our 2022 Senior Notes to the greater of $700 million or the calculated value under an Adjusted Consolidated Tangible Net Asset test, as defined.\nOur borrowings bear interest at either the LIBOR or prime rate plus an applicable margin, depending on the percentage of the commitment that has been utilized as of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin is 1.25%, and the unused commitment fee is 0.50%.\nWe had no balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, RNG had issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit of approximately $11.7 million in favor of a third-party transportation service provider to secure firm transportation of the natural gas produced by third-party producers for whom we market production in the Appalachian Basin. The letter of credit expires in September 2017 and is automatically extended annually in accordance with the letter of credit's terms and conditions. The letter of credit reduces the amount of available funds under our revolving credit facility by an amount equal to the letter of credit. While we have added and expect to continue to add producing reserves through our drilling operations, the effect of any such reserve additions on our borrowing base could be offset by other factors including, among other things, a prolonged period of depressed commodity prices or regulatory pressure on lenders to reduce their exposure to exploration and production companies.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. The covenants require that we maintain: (i) total debt of less than 4.00 times the trailing 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, change in fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives, exploration expense, gains (losses) on sales of assets and other non-cash, gains (losses) (\"EBITDAX\"), and (ii) an adjusted current ratio of at least 1.00:1.00. Our adjusted current ratio is adjusted by eliminating the impact on our current assets and liabilities of recording the fair value of crude oil and natural gas commodity derivative instruments. Additionally, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are added to the current asset calculation and the current portion of our revolving credit facility debt is eliminated from the current liabilities calculation. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants with a 2.10 times debt to EBITDAX ratio and a 5.00:1.00 current ratio. We expect to remain in compliance into the foreseeable future.\nThe indentures governing our 2024 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes contain customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (a) incur additional debt including limitations as to availability under our revolving credit facility, (b) make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase, redeem, or retire capital stock, (c) sell assets, including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries, (d) restrict the payment of dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to us, (e) create liens that secure debt, (f) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (g) merge or consolidate with another company. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance into the foreseeable future.\nIn January 2017, pursuant to the filing of the supplemental indentures for the 1.25% convertible senior notes due in 2021 (\"2021 Convertible Senior Notes\"), the 2024 Senior Notes, and the 2022 Senior Notes, our subsidiary PDC Permian, Inc., became a guarantor of the notes.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Our net cash flows from operating activities are primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, net settlements from our commodity derivative positions, operating costs, and general and administrative expenses. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015. The $75.2 million increase was primarily due to the increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $118.7 million. We also realized an increase in the change of funds held for future distribution of $36.5 million, and an increase in the deferral of income taxes of $13.1 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in monthly derivative commodity settlements of $30.8 million, and increases in general and administrative expense of $22.5 million, interest expense of $14.4 million, production taxes of $13.0 million and transportation, gathering, and processing expenses of $8.3 million.\nCash flows provided by operating activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014. The $174.4 million increase was primarily due to the increase in normal monthly derivative commodity settlements of $241.0 million and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $33.6 million and production taxes of $7.2 million. The increase was offset by the decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $92.7 million and an increase in lease operating costs of $14.6 million.\nAdjusted cash flows from operations, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, increased by $46.0 million in 2016 to $466.8 million, and $170.6 million to $420.8 million in 2015, when compared to the respective prior years. These changes were primarily due to the same factors mentioned above for changes in cash flows provided by operating activities, without regard to timing of cash payments and/or receipts of our assets and liabilities of $19.5 million and $9.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, decreased by $7.6 million in 2016 to $435.6 million from $443.2 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.0 million, the decrease in net settlements from our monthly derivative commodity settlements of $30.8 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $22.5 million, and a $27.8 million increase in production and exploration expense. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $118.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $78.9 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in normal monthly derivative commodity settlements of $241.0 million and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $33.6 million. The increase was partially\noffset by the decrease in crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales of $92.7 million, and an $88.8 million decrease in contribution margins from discontinued operations and a $14.6 million increase in lease operating costs.\nInvesting Activities. Because crude oil and natural gas production from a well declines rapidly in the first few years of production, we need to continue to invest significant amounts of capital in order to maintain and grow our production and replace our reserves. If capital markets are not available in the future, we will be limited to our cash flows from operations and liquidity under our revolving credit facility as the sources for funding our capital investments.\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consist of the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, net of dispositions of crude oil and natural gas properties. During 2016, our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin comprised the majority of our cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in the Delaware Basin acquisitions was $1.1 billion and we used cash of $436.9 million for our oil and gas operations. Our total cash used in investing activities during 2016 was approximately $1.5 billion. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the Wattenberg Field. In August 2016, we decreased the number of automated drilling rigs to three in anticipation of higher working interests in wells drilled resulting from an acreage exchange. In the Utica Shale, we drilled and completed five gross (4.5 net) wells, all of which were turned-in-line to sales in 2016. With the closing of our acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, we completed the drilling of two wells that were in-process at closing, spud an additional well, and turned-in-line one well prior to the end of 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $604.3 million during 2015 was primarily related to cash utilized for our drilling operations. Net cash used in investing activities of $474.1 million during 2014 was primarily related to cash utilized for our drilling operations of $623.8 million, offset in part by the $152.8 million net cash proceeds received from the sale of our entire 50 percent ownership interest in PDCM.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash from financing activities in 2016 was primarily related to the $855.1 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of 9.4 million shares of our common stock, $392.2 million of net proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Senior Notes and $193.9 million of net proceeds from issuance of the 2021 Convertible Notes, partially offset by the $115 million payment owed upon the maturity of the 2016 Convertible Notes and net payments of approximately $37.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility.\nNet cash from financing activities in 2015 was primarily related to $202.9 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock in March 2015, partially offset by net payments of approximately $19.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Net cash from financing activities in 2014 were primarily comprised of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $63.8 million to execute our capital budget.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and contingent commitments as of December 31, 2016:\n\n__________\n (1) Table does not include deferred income tax liability to taxing authorities of $143.5 million, due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. \n (2) Amount presented does not agree with the consolidated balance sheets in that it excludes $37.5 million of unamortized debt discount and $18.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. \n (3) Represents our gross liability related to the fair value of derivative positions. \n (4) Short-term capital lease obligations are included in other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \n (5) Includes deferred compensation to former executive officers and deferred payments related to firm transportation agreements. \n (6) Table does not include an undrawn $11.7 million irrevocable standby letter of credit pending issuance to a transportation service provider. Additionally, the table does not include the annual repurchase obligations to investing partners or termination benefits related to employment agreements with our executive officers, due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. \n (7) Amounts presented include $224.4 million to the holders of our 2022 Senior Notes, $188.7 million to the holders of our 2024 Senior Notes, and $115.2 million payable to the holders of our 2021 Convertible Notes. Amounts also include $11.0 million payable to the participating banks in our revolving credit facility, of which interest of $9.0 million is related to unutilized commitments at a rate of 0.38% per annum, and $0.2 million is related to our undrawn letters of credit. \n (8) Represents our gross commitment which includes volumes produced by us, purchased from third parties and produced by our affiliated partnerships and other third-party working, royalty and overriding royalty interest owners whose volumes we market on their behalf. This includes anticipated and estimated commitments associated with a new gas processing facility by our primary mid-stream provider. The timing of such payments has been estimated and is subject to change based on the completion of construction and the commencing of operations by the midstream provider. \nAs the managing general partner of affiliated partnerships, we have liability for potential casualty losses in excess of the partnership assets and insurance. We believe that the casualty insurance coverage we and our subcontractors carry is adequate to meet this potential liability.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation that we believe would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the following policies as critical to business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. This is not a comprehensive list of all of the accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with no need for our judgment in the application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and we may use significant judgment in the application. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on historical experience, observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the footnote titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Properties. We account for our crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of proved developed producing properties, successful exploratory wells and developmental dry hole costs are capitalized and depreciated or depleted by the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed producing reserves. Property acquisition costs are depreciated or depleted on the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves.\nAnnually, we engage independent petroleum engineers to prepare reserve and economic evaluations of all our properties on a well-by-well basis as of December 31. We adjust our crude oil and natural gas reserves for major acquisitions, new drilling, and divestitures during the year as needed. The process of estimating and evaluating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, revisions in existing reserve estimates occur. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent our most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates over time. Because estimates of reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense, a change in our estimated reserves could have an effect on our net income (loss).\nExploration costs, including geological and geophysical expenses, the acquisition of seismic data covering unproved acreage,\nand delay rentals, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory well drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if the well is determined to be nonproductive. The status of each in-progress well is reviewed quarterly to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting. Exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized as long as the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and we are making sufficient progress assessing our reserves and economic and operating viability. If an in-progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful prior to the issuance of the financial statements, the costs incurred prior to the end of the reporting period are charged to exploration expense. If we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of the financial statements, the well is classified as \"suspended well costs\" until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations to evaluate the pertinent geological and engineering data obtained. At the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well's productive status, the well is removed from the suspended well status and the proper accounting treatment is applied.\nThe acquisition costs of unproved properties are capitalized when incurred, until such properties are transferred to proved properties or charged to expense when expired, impaired, or amortized. Unproved crude oil and natural gas properties with individually significant acquisition costs are periodically assessed, and any impairment in value is charged to impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The\namount of impairment recognized on unproved properties which are not individually significant is determined by amortizing the costs of such properties within appropriate fields based on our historical experience, acquisition dates and average lease terms, with the amortization recognized in impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The valuation of unproved properties is subjective and requires us to make estimates and assumptions which, with the passage of time, may prove to be materially different from actual realizable values.\nWe assess our crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment upon a triggering event or when circumstances warrant\nby comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a field-by-field basis using estimated production based upon prices at which we reasonably estimate the commodity to be sold. Any impairment in value is charged to impairment of properties and equipment. The estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Any downward revisions in estimates to our reserve quantities, expectations of falling commodity prices, or rising operating costs could result in a triggering event, and therefore, a reduction in undiscounted future net cash flows and an impairment of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Although our cash flow estimates are based on the relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nCrude Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Sales Revenue Recognition. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a determinable price, delivery has occurred, rights and responsibility of ownership have transferred and collection of revenue is reasonably assured. We record sales revenue based on an estimate of the volumes delivered at estimated prices as determined by the applicable sales agreement. We estimate our sales volumes based on company-measured volume readings. We then adjust our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales in subsequent periods based on the data received from our purchasers that reflects actual volumes and prices received. We receive payment for sales from one to two months after actual delivery has occurred. The differences in sales estimates and actual sales are recorded one to two months later. Historically, these differences have been immaterial. If a sale is deemed uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful collection is recorded.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Our fair value measurements are estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity.\nCommodity Derivative Financial Instruments. We measure the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments based on a pricing model that utilizes market-based inputs, including but not limited to the contractual price of the underlying position, current market prices, natural gas, and crude oil forward curves, discount rates such as the LIBOR curve for a similar duration of each outstanding position, volatility factors and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of our credit standing on the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities and the effect of our counterparties' credit standings on the fair value of commodity derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding commodity derivative position.\nWe validate our fair value measurement through the review of counterparty statements and other supporting documentation, the determination that the source of the inputs is valid, the corroboration of the original source of inputs through access to multiple quotes, if available, or other information and monitoring changes in valuation methods and assumptions. While we use common industry practices to develop our valuation techniques, changes in our pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values. While we believe our valuation method is appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of a different methodology, or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.\nNet settlements on our commodity derivative instruments are initially recorded to accounts receivable or payable, as applicable, and may not be received from or paid to counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts within the same accounting period. Such settlements typically occur the month following the maturity of the commodity derivative instrument. We have evaluated the credit risk of the counterparties holding our commodity derivative assets, which are primarily financial institutions who are also major lenders in our revolving credit facility, giving consideration to amounts outstanding for each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding commodity derivative position. Based on our evaluation, we have determined that the potential impact of nonperformance of our counterparties on the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments is not significant.\nDeferred Income Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax asset is not expected to be realized under the preceding criteria, we establish a valuation allowance. The factors which we consider in assessing whether we will realize the value of deferred income tax assets involve judgments and estimates of both amount and timing. The judgments used in applying these policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for Business Combinations. We utilize the purchase method to account for acquisitions of businesses and assets. The value of the purchase consideration takes into account the degree to which the consideration is objective and measurable such as cash consideration paid to a seller. With the issuance of equity, restrictions upon the sale of the issued stock are taken into consideration. Pursuant to purchase method accounting, we allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocations are based on appraisals, discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates by management. When appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of crude oil and natural gas properties within the same regions and use that data as a basis for fair market value as such sales represent the amount at which a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties.\nIn estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved developed producing, proved developed non-producing, proved undeveloped and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties, and other non-crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves. When appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of crude oil and natural gas properties within the same regions and use that data as a basis for fair market value; for example, the amount at which a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties. We estimate future prices by using the applicable forward pricing strip to apply to our estimate of reserve quantities acquired, and estimates of future operating and development costs, to arrive at an estimate of future net revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues are discounted using a market-based weighted-average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted-average cost of capital rate is subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties, we reduce the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves by additional risk-weighting factors.\nWe record deferred taxes for any differences between the assigned values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee the footnote titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted cash flows from operations. We define adjusted cash flows from operations as the cash flows earned or incurred from operating activities, without regard to changes in operating assets and liabilities. We believe it is important to consider adjusted cash flows from operations, as well as cash flows from operations, as we believe it often provides more transparency into what drives the changes in our operating trends, such as production, prices, operating costs, and related operational factors, without regard to whether the related asset or liability was received or paid during the same period. We also use this measure because the timing of cash received from our assets, cash paid to obtain an asset or payment of our obligations has been only a timing issue from one period to the next as we have not had accounts receivable collection problems, nor been unable to purchase assets or pay our obligations.\nAdjusted net income (loss). We define adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives, each adjusted for tax effects. We believe it is important to consider adjusted net income (loss), as well as net income (loss). We believe this measure often provides more transparency into our operating trends, such as production, prices, operating costs, net settlements from derivatives and related factors, without regard to changes in our net income (loss) from mark-to-market adjustments resulting from net changes in the fair value of unsettled derivatives. Additionally, other items which we believe are not indicative of future results may be excluded to clearly identify operating trends.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives, interest expense, net of interest income, income taxes, impairment of properties and equipment, depreciation, depletion, and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), nor as an indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA includes certain non-cash costs incurred by us and does not take into account changes in operating assets and liabilities. Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA is relevant because it is a measure of our operational and financial performance, as well as a measure of our liquidity, and is used by our management, investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others that utilize our financial statements to analyze such things as:\n \u2022 operating performance and return on capital as compared to our peers; \n \u2022 financial performance of our assets and our valuation without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations and commitments; and \n \u2022 viability of acquisition opportunities and capital investment projects, including the related rate of return. \nPV-10. We define PV-10 as the estimated present value of the future net cash flows from our proved reserves before income taxes, discounted using a 10 percent discount rate. We believe that PV-10 provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. We believe that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our reserves. Professional analysts, investors, and other users of our financial statements may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies' reserves. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating us and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to its most comparable

increased significantly in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by expanded operations in the Wattenberg Field and acquisitions in the Delaware Basin. \n\n- Net loss was $245.9 million in 2016 compared to $68.3 million in 2015, primarily due to non-cash losses on commodity derivatives. Adjusted net loss, excluding derivative gains/losses, was $37 million in 2016 versus $46.1 million in 2015.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly to $435.6 million in 2016 from $443.2 million in 2015, primarily due to a provision for uncollectible notes receivable and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. \n\n- Capital investments were $1.76 billion in 2016, focused on development drilling and acquisitions. Liquidity was $932.4 million at year-end.\n\n- Proved reserves were 652 MMBoe at year-end 2016, up 230% from 2015. PV-10 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2015.\n\n- Outlook for 2017 includes production of 30-33 MMBoe with capital investments of $725-775 million focused on the Wattenberg Field and Delaware Basin.\n\nIn summary, the company significantly grew production and expanded acreage position in 2016 but experienced lower earnings and cash flows due to low commodity prices and derivative losses. Liquidity remains strong to fund continued growth."}
