Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nThe company is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company has one of the world's broadest portfolios of product offerings available from leading electronic components and enterprise computing solutions suppliers, coupled with a range of services, solutions and tools that help industrial and commercial customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. The company has two business segments, the global components business segment and the global ECS business segment. The company distributes electronic components to OEMs and CMs through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to VARs through its global ECS business segment. For 2016, approximately 65% of the company's sales were from the global components business segment and approximately 35% of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment.\nThe company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and/or expand its geographic reach.\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated sales for 2016 increased by 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period, due to a 7.0% increase in global components business segment sales, offset partially by a 5.2% decrease in global ECS business segment sales. Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales increased 0.5% compared with the year-earlier period.\nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $522.8 million in 2016 compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $497.7 million in the year-earlier period. The following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restructuring, integration, and other charges of $73.6 million in 2016 and $68.8 million in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifiable intangible asset amortization of $54.9 million in 2016 and $51.0 million in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a gain on sale of investment of $2.0 million in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a loss on investment of $3.0 million in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a loss on prepayment of debt of $2.9 million in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders increased to $609.8 million in 2016 compared with $592.3 million in the year-earlier period.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sales, income, or expense items as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as \"impact of changes in foreign currencies\") and the impact of acquisitions by adjusting the company's prior periods to include the operating results of businesses acquired, including the amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented (referred to as \"impact of acquisitions\");\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating income as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, and impairment charge; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net income attributable to shareholders as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, impairment charge, gain on sale of investment, loss on investment, loss on prepayment of debt, and settlement of certain international tax matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSales\nSubstantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as adjusted*\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as adjusted*\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* The sum of the components for sales, as adjusted, may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nConsolidated sales for 2016 increased by $543.2 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2016 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $1.0 billion, or 7.0%, offset partially by a decrease in global ECS business segment sales of $459.8 million, or 5.2%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 0.5% in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2016 increased 7.0% compared with the year-earlier period, primarily driven by increased demand in the Asia regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global components business segment sales increased by 5.1% in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2016 decreased 5.2% compared with the year-earlier period, primarily driven by a decrease in hardware sales offset by an increase in software sales, a significant portion of which are recognized on a net basis, and the impact of changes in foreign currencies. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global ECS business segment sales decreased by 7.0% in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by $513.3 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period.

Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.9% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2015 increased 0.6% compared with the year-earlier period primarily driven by increased demand in the EMEA regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses, offset in part by the impact of changes in foreign currencies. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global components business segment sales increased by 1.3% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2015 increased 5.0% compared with the year-earlier period primarily driven by increased demand in the EMEA regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses, offset in part by the impact of changes in foreign currencies.

The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased demand for the Asia/Pacific and Europe regions of the components business, offset partially by a\nshift in the overall percentage of sales attributable to the Asia/Pacific region. The company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.\nGross profit margins for 2016 increased by approximately 20 basis points, compared with the year-earlier period primarily due to a more favorable product mix in the global ECS business. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated gross profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nFollowing is an analysis of gross profit for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of sales, as reported\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe company recorded gross profit of $3.04 billion and $3.00 billion for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Included in the restructuring, integration, and other charges for 2016 is a restructuring and integration charge of $32.9 million related to initiatives taken by the company to improve operating efficiencies, which includes personnel costs of $25.8 million, facilities costs of $5.8 million, and other costs of $1.3 million. These restructuring initiatives are due to the company's continued efforts to lower cost and drive operational efficiency. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses within the company's pre-existing business and the consolidation of certain operations. Also included is a charge of $3.6 million related to restructuring and integration actions taken in prior periods.\nIncluded in restructuring, integration, and other charges for 2016 are other expenses of $37.1 million, which include the following charges and credits.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.

Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. It is the company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States and its current plans do not demonstrate a\nneed to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. If these funds were to be needed for the company's operations in the United States, it would be required to record and pay significant United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. Additionally, local government regulations may restrict the company's ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. The company currently does not expect such regulations and restrictions to impact its ability to make acquisitions or to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.\nDuring 2016, the net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities was $355.8 million, the net amount of cash used for investing activities was $241.4 million, and the net amount of cash provided by financing activities was $166.1 million.

Included in capital expenditures for 2015 is $48.8 million related to the company's global ERP initiative.\nDuring 2015, the company completed ten acquisitions, inclusive of a 53.7% acquisition of Data Modul AG. The aggregate consideration paid for these ten acquisitions was $514.7 million, net of cash acquired, contingent consideration and other amounts withheld.\nThe net amount of cash used for investing activities during 2014 was $244.8 million, primarily reflecting $162.9 million of cash consideration paid for acquired businesses, $122.5 million for capital expenditures, and $40.5 million of proceeds from sale of investment.

The net proceeds of the offering of $688.2 million were used to refinance the company's 3.375% notes due November 2015 and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring 2015, the company redeemed $250.0 million principal amount of its 3.375% notes due November 2015. The related loss on the redemption for the year-ended December 31, 2015 aggregated $2.9 million and was recognized as a loss on prepayment of debt in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe net amount of cash used for financing activities during 2014 was $434.9 million. The uses of cash from financing activities included $145.0 million of net repayments of long-term borrowings, $304.8 million of repurchases of common stock, a $12.5 million decrease in short-term and other borrowings, and other contingent consideration payments of $1.5 million. The source of cash from financing activities during 2014 was $28.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and other benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements.\nThe company has a revolving credit facility that may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness, acquisitions, and as support for the company's commercial paper program, as applicable. In December 2016, the company amended its revolving credit facility and, among other things, increased its borrowing capacity from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and extended its term to mature in December 2021. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (1.18% at December 31, 2016), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.99% at December 31, 2016. The facility fee is .20%. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. The company had $72.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was $8.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nThe company has a commercial paper program and the maximum aggregate balance of commercial paper notes outstanding may not exceed the borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. The company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the commercial paper program was $285.9 million and $362.4 million, respectively.\nThe company has an asset securitization program collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of its subsidiaries. In September 2016, the company amended its asset securitization program and, among other things, increased its borrowing capacity from $900.0 to $910.0 and extended its term to mature in September 2019. The asset securitization program is conducted through Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation (\"AFC\"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The asset securitization program does not qualify for sale treatment. Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (.40% at December 31, 2016), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.31% at December 31, 2016. The facility fee is .40%. The company had $460.0 million and $75.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was $661.6 million and $498.7 million, respectively.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. The company was in compliance with all\ncovenants as of December 31, 2016 and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future.\nDuring 2014, the company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted line of credit. Under this agreement, the company may borrow up to a total of $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at December 31, 2016 and 2015. During 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the uncommitted line of credit was $34.3 million and $17.3 million, respectively.\nIn the normal course of business certain of the company's subsidiaries have agreements to sell, without recourse, selected trade receivables to financial institutions. The company does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables, and accordingly they are accounted for as sales of the related receivables and the receivables are removed from the company's consolidated balance sheets. Financing costs related to these transactions were not material and are included in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in October 2015 registering debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, and warrants of Arrow Electronics, Inc. that may be issued by the company from time to time. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by the company for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nManagement believes that the company's current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and asset securitization program, its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows, and the company's access to capital markets are sufficient to meet its projected cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nPayments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>960,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,185,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,785,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>117,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>2,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>71,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (a)\n</td> <td>3,752,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,830,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (b)\n</td> <td>13,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,049,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,327,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>756,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,446,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,580,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts represent an estimate of non-cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of December 31, 2016.

There were no outstanding borrowings under the third party agreements of the joint ventures as of December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, the company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a liability for the payment of related interest totaling $31.5 million, of which approximately $0.4 million is expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\nShare-Repurchase Programs\nThe following table shows the company's Board approved share-repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month of Board Approval\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Value Approved for Repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Value of Shares Repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nDollar Value of\nShares that May\nYet be\nPurchased\nUnder the\nProgram\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe company has no off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which historically have not been material.\nA portion of the company's business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers. In these transactions, the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms with the customer, product returns, and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment. As the principal with the customer, the company recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product was shipped.\nThe company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis (that is, the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales). Generally, these transactions relate to the sale of supplier service contracts to customers where the company has no future obligation to perform under these contracts or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors, including the length of time the receivables are outstanding, the current business environment, and historical experience.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nInvestments\nThe company accounts for available-for-sale investments at fair value, using quoted market prices, and the related holding gains and losses are included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company assesses its long-term investments on an ongoing basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary. When the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company's consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs. The company makes such determination after considering the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and operating results of the investee, and the company's intent and ability to retain the investment over time to potentially allow for any recovery in market value. In addition, the company assesses the following factors:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>broad economic factors impacting the investee's industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cyclical nature of the investee's industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe company could incur an impairment charge in future periods if, among other factors, the investee's future earnings differ from currently available forecasts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe carrying value of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.\nIt is the company's policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2016, the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading. Certain derivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market each reporting period with any unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings.\nThe company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. The company also occasionally enters into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the rate on an anticipated future long-term debt issuance. The company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its interest rate swaps on a quarterly basis. The\neffective portion of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges is recorded as a change to the carrying value of the related hedged debt, and the effective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, if any, is recorded in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims related to environmental, regulatory, labor, product, tax, and other matters and assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome for these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. A determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis. The reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss, the estimate of such loss, and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition, which cliff vest, are recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. Stock-based compensation awards with service conditions only are also recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. The company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the company's performance, and related tax impacts.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter and/or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Examples of such events and circumstances that the company would consider include the following:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for the company's products or services, or a regulatory or political development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; contemplation of bankruptcy; or litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill is tested at a level of reporting referred to as \"the reporting unit.\" The company's reporting units are defined as each of the three regional businesses within the global components business segment, which are the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific and each of the two regional businesses within the global ECS business segment, which are North America and EMEA.\nAn entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The company has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and began its impairment testing with the first step of the two-\nstep impairment process. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, compares the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.\nThe company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, forecasted capital expenditures, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company's forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015, and 2014, the company's annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company's reporting units.\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company has $2.4 billion of goodwill, of which approximately $1.1 billion, $78.6 million and $61.2 million was allocated to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment, respectively and $800.0 million and $352.5 million was allocated to the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment, respectively. As of the date of the company's latest impairment test, the fair value of the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment and the fair value of the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately 16%, 127%, 12%, 416%, and 106%, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. The company also tests indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of acquired trade names, for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.\nFactors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life. If any of these factors exist, the company is required to test the long-lived asset for recoverability and may be required to recognize an impairment charge for all or a portion of the asset's carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) (\"ASU No. 2017-04\"). ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the annual goodwill impairment test. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted on\nJanuary 1, 2017, and is to be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2017-04 would not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations unless step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test fails.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810) (\"ASU No. 2016-17\"). ASU No. 2016-17 amends the consolidation guidance on how variable interest entities should treat indirect interest in the entity held through related parties. ASU No. 2016-17 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a retrospective approach. Effective October 2, 2016, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-17 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2016-17 did not impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Topic 740) (\"ASU No. 2016-16\"). ASU No. 2016-16 clarifies the accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. ASU No. 2016-16 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-16.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) (\"ASU No. 2016-15\"). ASU No. 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a retrospective approach. The company is expected to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2017, and the provisions are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASU No. 2016-13\"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) (\"ASU No. 2016-09\"). ASU No. 2016-09 revises the accounting treatment for excess tax benefits, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, and forfeitures related to share-based awards. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2017. The provisions of ASU 2016-09 are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging - Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (Topic 815) (\"ASU No. 2016-06\"). ASU No. 2016-06 clarifies the steps required to assess whether a call or put option meets the criteria for bifurcation as an embedded derivative. Effective April 3, 2016, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-06 on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2016-06 did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASU No. 2016-02\"). ASU No. 2016-02 requires the entity to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting expense recognition in the income statement. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. While the company continues to evaluate the effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, the company expects most existing operating lease commitments will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825) (\"ASU No. 2016-01\"). ASU No. 2016-01 revises the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for certain financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU No. 2016-01 requires the change in fair value of many equity investments to be recognized in net income. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied prospectively. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\"ASU No. 2015-17\"). ASU No. 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified\nas noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Effective October 2, 2016, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-17 on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-17 resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax liabilities and assets from current to noncurrent and did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU No. 2015-11\"). ASU No. 2015-11 requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the update at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Effective January 1, 2016, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-11 on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-11 did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. In March, April, May, and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (\"ASU No. 2016-08\"); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (\"ASU No. 2016-10\"); ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (\"ASU No. 2016-12\"); and ASU No. 2016-19, Technical Corrections and Improvements (\"ASU No. 2016-19\"), respectively. ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-19 provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU No. 2014-09, and must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09, ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-19.\nIn 2014, the company established an implementation team ( team\u201d) and engaged external advisers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the company's business and contracts, as well as any changes to processes or systems to adopt the requirements of the new standard. The team has updated the assessment for new ASU updates and for newly acquired businesses. The team is in the process of developing its conclusions on several aspects of the standard including principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations and the determination of when control of goods and services transfers to the company's customers.\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: industry conditions, the company's implementation of its new enterprise resource planning system, changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand, competition, other vagaries in the global components and global ECS markets, changes in relationships with key suppliers, increased profit margin pressure, the effects of additional actions taken to become more efficient or lower costs, risks related to the integration of acquired businesses, changes in legal and regulatory matters, and the company's ability to generate additional cash flow. Forward-looking statements are those statements which are not statements of historical fact.

The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nThe company is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company has one of the world's broadest portfolios of product offerings available from leading electronic components and enterprise computing solutions suppliers, coupled with a range of services, solutions and tools that help industrial and commercial customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. The company has two business segments, the global components business segment and the global ECS business segment. The company distributes electronic components to OEMs and CMs through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to VARs through its global ECS business segment. For 2016, approximately 65% of the company's sales were from the global components business segment and approximately 35% of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment.\nThe company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and/or expand its geographic reach.\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated sales for 2016 increased by 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period, due to a 7.0% increase in global components business segment sales, offset partially by a 5.2% decrease in global ECS business segment sales. Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales increased 0.5% compared with the year-earlier period.\nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $522.8 million in 2016 compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $497.7 million in the year-earlier period. The following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 restructuring, integration, and other charges of $73.6 million in 2016 and $68.8 million in 2015; \n \u2022 identifiable intangible asset amortization of $54.9 million in 2016 and $51.0 million in 2015; \n \u2022 a gain on sale of investment of $2.0 million in 2015; \n \u2022 a loss on investment of $3.0 million in 2015; and \n \u2022 a loss on prepayment of debt of $2.9 million in 2015. \nExcluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders increased to $609.8 million in 2016 compared with $592.3 million in the year-earlier period.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\n \u2022 Sales, income, or expense items as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as \"impact of changes in foreign currencies\") and the impact of acquisitions by adjusting the company's prior periods to include the operating results of businesses acquired, including the amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented (referred to as \"impact of acquisitions\"); \n \u2022 Operating income as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, and impairment charge; and \n \u2022 Net income attributable to shareholders as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, impairment charge, gain on sale of investment, loss on investment, loss on prepayment of debt, and settlement of certain international tax matters. \nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSales\nSubstantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as adjusted*\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as adjusted*\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* The sum of the components for sales, as adjusted, may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nConsolidated sales for 2016 increased by $543.2 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2016 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $1.0 billion, or 7.0%, offset partially by a decrease in global ECS business segment sales of $459.8 million, or 5.2%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 0.5% in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2016 increased 7.0% compared with the year-earlier period, primarily driven by increased demand in the Asia regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global components business segment sales increased by 5.1% in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2016 decreased 5.2% compared with the year-earlier period, primarily driven by a decrease in hardware sales offset by an increase in software sales, a significant portion of which are recognized on a net basis, and the impact of changes in foreign currencies.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was $661.6 million and $498.7 million, respectively.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. The company was in compliance with all\ncovenants as of December 31, 2016 and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future.\nDuring 2014, the company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted line of credit. Under this agreement, the company may borrow up to a total of $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at December 31, 2016 and 2015. During 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the uncommitted line of credit was $34.3 million and $17.3 million, respectively.\nIn the normal course of business certain of the company's subsidiaries have agreements to sell, without recourse, selected trade receivables to financial institutions. The company does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables, and accordingly they are accounted for as sales of the related receivables and the receivables are removed from the company's consolidated balance sheets. Financing costs related to these transactions were not material and are included in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in October 2015 registering debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, and warrants of Arrow Electronics, Inc. that may be issued by the company from time to time. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by the company for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nManagement believes that the company's current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and asset securitization program, its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows, and the company's access to capital markets are sufficient to meet its projected cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nPayments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>960,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,185,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,785,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>117,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>2,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>71,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (a)\n</td> <td>3,752,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,830,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (b)\n</td> <td>13,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,049,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,327,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>756,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,446,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,580,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Amounts represent an estimate of non-cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of December 31, 2016. Most of the company's inventory purchases are pursuant to authorized distributor agreements, which are typically cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice, usually within a few months. \n (b) Includes estimates of contributions required to meet the requirements of the Wyle defined benefit plan. Amounts are subject to change based upon the performance of plan assets, as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation. The company does not anticipate having to make required contributions to the plans beyond 2025. Also included are amounts relating to personnel, facilities, and certain other costs resulting from restructuring and integration activities. \nUnder the terms of various joint venture agreements, the company is required to pay its pro-rata share of the third party debt of the joint ventures in the event that the joint ventures are unable to meet their obligations. There were no outstanding borrowings under the third party agreements of the joint ventures as of December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, the company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a liability for the payment of related interest totaling $31.5 million, of which approximately $0.4 million is expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\nShare-Repurchase Programs\nThe following table shows the company's Board approved share-repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month of Board Approval\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Value Approved for Repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Value of Shares Repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nDollar Value of\nShares that May\nYet be\nPurchased\nUnder the\nProgram\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe company has no off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which historically have not been material.\nA portion of the company's business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers. In these transactions, the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms with the customer, product returns, and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment. As the principal with the customer, the company recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product was shipped.\nThe company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis (that is, the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales). Generally, these transactions relate to the sale of supplier service contracts to customers where the company has no future obligation to perform under these contracts or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors, including the length of time the receivables are outstanding, the current business environment, and historical experience.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nInvestments\nThe company accounts for available-for-sale investments at fair value, using quoted market prices, and the related holding gains and losses are included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company assesses its long-term investments on an ongoing basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary. When the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company's consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs. The company makes such determination after considering the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and operating results of the investee, and the company's intent and ability to retain the investment over time to potentially allow for any recovery in market value. In addition, the company assesses the following factors:\n \u2022 broad economic factors impacting the investee's industry; \n \u2022 publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee; and \n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the investee's industry. \nThe company could incur an impairment charge in future periods if, among other factors, the investee's future earnings differ from currently available forecasts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe carrying value of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.\nIt is the company's policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2016, the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading. Certain derivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market each reporting period with any unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings.\nThe company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. The company also occasionally enters into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the rate on an anticipated future long-term debt issuance. The company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its interest rate swaps on a quarterly basis. The\neffective portion of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges is recorded as a change to the carrying value of the related hedged debt, and the effective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, if any, is recorded in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims related to environmental, regulatory, labor, product, tax, and other matters and assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome for these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. A determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis. The reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss, the estimate of such loss, and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition, which cliff vest, are recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. Stock-based compensation awards with service conditions only are also recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. The company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the company's performance, and related tax impacts.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter and/or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Examples of such events and circumstances that the company would consider include the following:\n \u2022 macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; \n \u2022 industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for the company's products or services, or a regulatory or political development; \n \u2022 cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows; \n \u2022 overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods; \n \u2022 other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; contemplation of bankruptcy; or litigation; \n \u2022 events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit; and \n \u2022 a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). \nGoodwill is tested at a level of reporting referred to as \"the reporting unit.\" The company's reporting units are defined as each of the three regional businesses within the global components business segment, which are the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific and each of the two regional businesses within the global ECS business segment, which are North America and EMEA.\nAn entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The company has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and began its impairment testing with the first step of the two-\nstep impairment process. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, compares the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.\nThe company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, forecasted capital expenditures, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company's forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015, and 2014, the company's annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company's reporting units.\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company has $2.4 billion of goodwill, of which approximately $1.1 billion, $78.6 million and $61.2 million was allocated to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment, respectively and $800.0 million and $352.5 million was allocated to the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment, respectively. As of the date of the company's latest impairment test, the fair value of the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment and the fair value of the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately 16%, 127%, 12%, 416%, and 106%, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. The company also tests indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of acquired trade names, for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.\nFactors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life. If any of these factors exist, the company is required to test the long-lived asset for recoverability and may be required to recognize an impairment charge for all or a portion of the asset's carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) (\"ASU No. 2017-04\"). ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the annual goodwill impairment test. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted on\nJanuary 1, 2017, and is to be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2017-04 would not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations unless step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test fails.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810) (\"ASU No. 2016-17\"). ASU No. 2016-17 amends the consolidation guidance on how variable interest entities should treat indirect interest in the entity held through related parties. ASU No. 2016-17 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a retrospective approach. Effective October 2, 2016, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-17 on a retrospective basis.

ASU No. 2016-16 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-16.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) (\"ASU No. 2016-15\"). ASU No. 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a retrospective approach. The company is expected to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2017, and the provisions are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASU No. 2016-13\"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) (\"ASU No. 2016-09\"). ASU No. 2016-09 revises the accounting treatment for excess tax benefits, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, and forfeitures related to share-based awards.

The provisions of ASU 2016-09 are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging - Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (Topic 815) (\"ASU No. 2016-06\"). ASU No. 2016-06 clarifies the steps required to assess whether a call or put option meets the criteria for bifurcation as an embedded derivative. Effective April 3, 2016, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-06 on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2016-06 did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASU No. 2016-02\"). ASU No. 2016-02 requires the entity to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting expense recognition in the income statement. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. While the company continues to evaluate the effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, the company expects most existing operating lease commitments will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825) (\"ASU No. 2016-01\"). ASU No. 2016-01 revises the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for certain financial liabilities measured at fair value.

ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nThe company is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company has one of the world's broadest portfolios of product offerings available from leading electronic components and enterprise computing solutions suppliers, coupled with a range of services, solutions and tools that help industrial and commercial customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. The company has two business segments, the global components business segment and the global ECS business segment. The company distributes electronic components to OEMs and CMs through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to VARs through its global ECS business segment. For 2016, approximately 65% of the company's sales were from the global components business segment and approximately 35% of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment.\nThe company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and/or expand its geographic reach.\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated sales for 2016 increased by 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period, due to a 7.0% increase in global components business segment sales, offset partially by a 5.2% decrease in global ECS business segment sales. Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales increased 0.5% compared with the year-earlier period.\nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $522.8 million in 2016 compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $497.7 million in the year-earlier period. The following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 restructuring, integration, and other charges of $73.6 million in 2016 and $68.8 million in 2015; \n \u2022 identifiable intangible asset amortization of $54.9 million in 2016 and $51.0 million in 2015; \n \u2022 a gain on sale of investment of $2.0 million in 2015; \n \u2022 a loss on investment of $3.0 million in 2015; and \n \u2022 a loss on prepayment of debt of $2.9 million in 2015. \nExcluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders increased to $609.8 million in 2016 compared with $592.3 million in the year-earlier period.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\n \u2022 Sales, income, or expense items as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as \"impact of changes in foreign currencies\") and the impact of acquisitions by adjusting the company's prior periods to include the operating results of businesses acquired, including the amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented (referred to as \"impact of acquisitions\"); \n \u2022 Operating income as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, and impairment charge; and \n \u2022 Net income attributable to shareholders as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, impairment charge, gain on sale of investment, loss on investment, loss on prepayment of debt, and settlement of certain international tax matters. \nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSales\nSubstantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\n* The sum of the components for sales, as adjusted, may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nConsolidated sales for 2016 increased by $543.2 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2016 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $1.0 billion, or 7.0%, offset partially by a decrease in global ECS business segment sales of $459.8 million, or 5.2%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 0.5% in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2016 increased 7.0% compared with the year-earlier period, primarily driven by increased demand in the Asia regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses.

The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased demand for the Asia/Pacific and Europe regions of the components business, offset partially by a\nshift in the overall percentage of sales attributable to the Asia/Pacific region. The company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.\nGross profit margins for 2016 increased by approximately 20 basis points, compared with the year-earlier period primarily due to a more favorable product mix in the global ECS business. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated gross profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points in 2016, compared with the year-earlier period.\nFollowing is an analysis of gross profit for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\nThe company recorded gross profit of $3.04 billion and $3.00 billion for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. It is the company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States and its current plans do not demonstrate a\nneed to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. If these funds were to be needed for the company's operations in the United States, it would be required to record and pay significant United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. Additionally, local government regulations may restrict the company's ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances.

The sources of cash from financing activities during 2015 were $688.2 million of net proceeds from a note offering and $20.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and other benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements.\nDuring 2015, the company completed the sale of $350.0 million principal amount of 3.50% notes due in 2022 and $350.0 million principal amount of 4.00% notes due in 2025. The net proceeds of the offering of $688.2 million were used to refinance the company's 3.375% notes due November 2015 and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring 2015, the company redeemed $250.0 million principal amount of its 3.375% notes due November 2015. The related loss on the redemption for the year-ended December 31, 2015 aggregated $2.9 million and was recognized as a loss on prepayment of debt in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe net amount of cash used for financing activities during 2014 was $434.9 million. The uses of cash from financing activities included $145.0 million of net repayments of long-term borrowings, $304.8 million of repurchases of common stock, a $12.5 million decrease in short-term and other borrowings, and other contingent consideration payments of $1.5 million. The source of cash from financing activities during 2014 was $28.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and other benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements.\nThe company has a revolving credit facility that may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness, acquisitions, and as support for the company's commercial paper program, as applicable. In December 2016, the company amended its revolving credit facility and, among other things, increased its borrowing capacity from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and extended its term to mature in December 2021. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (1.18% at December 31, 2016), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.99% at December 31, 2016. The facility fee is.20%. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. The company had $72.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was $8.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nThe company has a commercial paper program and the maximum aggregate balance of commercial paper notes outstanding may not exceed the borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. The company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the commercial paper program was $285.9 million and $362.4 million, respectively.\nThe company has an asset securitization program collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of its subsidiaries. In September 2016, the company amended its asset securitization program and, among other things, increased its borrowing capacity from $900.0 to $910.0 and extended its term to mature in September 2019. The asset securitization program is conducted through Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation (\"AFC\"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The asset securitization program does not qualify for sale treatment. Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (.40% at December 31, 2016), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.31% at December 31, 2016. The facility fee is.40%. The company had $460.0 million and $75.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was $661.6 million and $498.7 million, respectively.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. The company was in compliance with all\ncovenants as of December 31, 2016 and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future.\nDuring 2014, the company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted line of credit. Under this agreement, the company may borrow up to a total of $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at December 31, 2016 and 2015. During 2016 and 2015, the average daily balance outstanding under the uncommitted line of credit was $34.3 million and $17.3 million, respectively.\nIn the normal course of business certain of the company's subsidiaries have agreements to sell, without recourse, selected trade receivables to financial institutions. The company does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables, and accordingly they are accounted for as sales of the related receivables and the receivables are removed from the company's consolidated balance sheets. Financing costs related to these transactions were not material and are included in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in October 2015 registering debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, and warrants of Arrow Electronics, Inc. that may be issued by the company from time to time. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by the company for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nManagement believes that the company's current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and asset securitization program, its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows, and the company's access to capital markets are sufficient to meet its projected cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nPayments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\n\n (a) Amounts represent an estimate of non-cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of December 31, 2016. Most of the company's inventory purchases are pursuant to authorized distributor agreements, which are typically cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice, usually within a few months. \n (b) Includes estimates of contributions required to meet the requirements of the Wyle defined benefit plan. Amounts are subject to change based upon the performance of plan assets, as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation. The company does not anticipate having to make required contributions to the plans beyond 2025. Also included are amounts relating to personnel, facilities, and certain other costs resulting from restructuring and integration activities. \nUnder the terms of various joint venture agreements, the company is required to pay its pro-rata share of the third party debt of the joint ventures in the event that the joint ventures are unable to meet their obligations. There were no outstanding borrowings under the third party agreements of the joint ventures as of December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, the company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a liability for the payment of related interest totaling $31.5 million, of which approximately $0.4 million is expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\nShare-Repurchase Programs\nThe following table shows the company's Board approved share-repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe company has no off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which historically have not been material.\nA portion of the company's business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers. In these transactions, the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms with the customer, product returns, and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment. As the principal with the customer, the company recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product was shipped.\nThe company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis (that is, the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales). Generally, these transactions relate to the sale of supplier service contracts to customers where the company has no future obligation to perform under these contracts or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors, including the length of time the receivables are outstanding, the current business environment, and historical experience.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nInvestments\nThe company accounts for available-for-sale investments at fair value, using quoted market prices, and the related holding gains and losses are included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company assesses its long-term investments on an ongoing basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary. When the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company's consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs. The company makes such determination after considering the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and operating results of the investee, and the company's intent and ability to retain the investment over time to potentially allow for any recovery in market value. In addition, the company assesses the following factors:\n \u2022 broad economic factors impacting the investee's industry; \n \u2022 publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee; and \n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the investee's industry. \nThe company could incur an impairment charge in future periods if, among other factors, the investee's future earnings differ from currently available forecasts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe carrying value of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.\nIt is the company's policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2016, the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading. Certain derivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market each reporting period with any unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings.\nThe company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. The company also occasionally enters into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the rate on an anticipated future long-term debt issuance. The company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its interest rate swaps on a quarterly basis. The\neffective portion of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges is recorded as a change to the carrying value of the related hedged debt, and the effective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, if any, is recorded in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims related to environmental, regulatory, labor, product, tax, and other matters and assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome for these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. A determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis. The reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss, the estimate of such loss, and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition, which cliff vest, are recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. Stock-based compensation awards with service conditions only are also recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. The company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the company's performance, and related tax impacts.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter and/or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Examples of such events and circumstances that the company would consider include the following:\n \u2022 macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; \n \u2022 industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for the company's products or services, or a regulatory or political development; \n \u2022 cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows; \n \u2022 overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods; \n \u2022 other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; contemplation of bankruptcy; or litigation; \n \u2022 events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit; and \n \u2022 a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). \nGoodwill is tested at a level of reporting referred to as \"the reporting unit.\" The company's reporting units are defined as each of the three regional businesses within the global components business segment, which are the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific and each of the two regional businesses within the global ECS business segment, which are North America and EMEA.\nAn entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The company has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and began its impairment testing with the first step of the two-\nstep impairment process. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, compares the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.\nThe company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, forecasted capital expenditures, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company's forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015, and 2014, the company's annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company's reporting units.\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company has $2.4 billion of goodwill, of which approximately $1.1 billion, $78.6 million and $61.2 million was allocated to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment, respectively and $800.0 million and $352.5 million was allocated to the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment, respectively. As of the date of the company's latest impairment test, the fair value of the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment and the fair value of the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately 16%, 127%, 12%, 416%, and 106%, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. The company also tests indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of acquired trade names, for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.\nFactors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life. If any of these factors exist, the company is required to test the long-lived asset for recoverability and may be required to recognize an impairment charge for all or a portion of the asset's carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) (\"ASU No. 2017-04\"). ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the annual goodwill impairment test. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted on\nJanuary 1, 2017, and is to be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2017-04 would not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations unless step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test fails.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810) (\"ASU No. 2016-17\").

ASU No. 2016-02 requires the entity to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting expense recognition in the income statement. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. While the company continues to evaluate the effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, the company expects most existing operating lease commitments will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825) (\"ASU No. 2016-01\").
