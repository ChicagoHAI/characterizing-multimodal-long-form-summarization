EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect primarily their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See \"Utility Regulation - State Utility Regulation - New York Utility Industry - Reforming the Energy Vision,\" \"Competition\" and \"Environmental Matters - Climate Change\" in Item 1. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs\u201d in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA results in decreased cash flows from operating activities. See Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies,\u201d in Item 1A, Federal Income Tax\u201d in Note A, Rate Plans\u201d in Note B, Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies' cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans - CECONY- Electric and Gas\" and \"Rate Plans - O&R New York - Electric and Gas\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. For Con Edison, 2018 net income also includes a non-cash gain recognized with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC at the Clean Energy Businesses ($131 million). See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $672 million and $662 million lower, respectively, than in 2017. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily cash payments for MTA power reliability costs ($179 million and $179 million, respectively) and Puerto Rico related restoration costs ($104 million and $98 million, respectively), storm restoration costs ($193 million and $133 million, respectively), higher accounts receivable from customers ($149 million and $168 million, respectively) primarily due to an increase in billed revenues for gas, higher pension and retiree benefit obligations ($89 million and $77 million, respectively), and lower income tax refunds received, net of income taxes paid ($29 million and $87 million, respectively). The change in net cash flows for CECONY also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($195 million) primarily related to estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY's ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. The overpayment of estimated federal tax payments in 2018 will be settled in cash in 2019 when Con Edison files its extension for the 2018 federal tax return. These changes are offset in part by the cash impact of the Utilities' estimated net benefits in the 2018 period under the TCJA ($434 million and $411 million, respectively). See Assets, Liabilities and Equity,\u201d below.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $92 million and $172 million lower, respectively, than in 2016. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily higher cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, in 2017 as compared with 2016 of $151 million and $270 million, respectively. The income tax refund received in 2016 reflected the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015, resulting in a refund of the 2015 estimated federal tax payments. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY also reflects higher construction expenditures in accounts payable of $44 million and $56 million, respectively.\nThe change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable - customers, recoverable and refundable energy costs within other regulatory assets and liabilities and accounts payable balances.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,761 million and $226 million higher, respectively, in 2018 than in 2017. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily the acquisition of Sempra\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> <td>73\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSolar Holdings, LLC, net of cash acquired, at the Clean Energy Businesses ($1,488 million) (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8), higher new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($204 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($211 million) and O&R ($10 million), offset in part by lower non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($169 million).\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,240 million lower and $327 million higher, respectively, in 2017 than in 2016. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily lower new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($1,032 million) and renewable electric production projects at the Clean Energy Businesses ($349 million) and a decrease in non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($430 million), offset in part by lower proceeds from the sale of assets at the Clean Energy Businesses ($201 million) and transfer of assets to NY Transco at CECONY ($122 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($168 million) and O&R ($22 million).\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $2,581 million and $950 million higher, respectively, than in 2017. Net cash flows from financing activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $988 million lower and $680 million higher, respectively, than in 2016.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the following Con Edison transactions:\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued 9,324,123 common shares for $705 million pursuant to forward sale agreements and borrowed $825 million under a variable rate term loan, which amounts, along with $79 million of other company funds, were used to pay the purchase price for the acquisition by a Con Edison Development subsidiary of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC.

The change in current assets reflects primarily an increase in customer accounts receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts ($154 million), reflecting primarily an increase in billed revenues for gas. It also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($150 million), reflecting primarily estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY's ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. The overpayment of estimated federal tax payments in 2018 will be settled in cash in 2019 when Con Edison files its extension for the 2018 federal tax return. It also reflects an increase to other receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts ($119 million), reflecting costs related to aid provided by the Utilities in the restoration of power in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of September 2017 hurricanes that have been billed to the appropriate authorities. As of December 31, 2018, CECONY's other receivables' balances related to such costs was $98 million. See \"Other Receivables\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $2 million higher than at December 31, 2017.

See \"Investments\" in Note A and Note E to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet plant at December 31, 2018 was $2,165 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in net plant reflects primarily an increase in electric distribution ($720 million) and gas ($704 million) plant and construction work in progress ($348 million). At December 31, 2018, utility plant of CECONY included $95 million related to a May 2018 acquisition of software licenses.

The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily an increase in the regulatory asset for MTA power reliability deferral ($179 million) which reflects costs incurred and deferred as a regulatory asset in the 2018 period. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. It also reflects an increase in the regulatory asset for property tax reconciliation ($61 million), environmental remediation costs ($39 million) and revenues taxes ($30 million). Revenue taxes represent the timing difference between taxes collected and paid by CECONY to fund mass transportation. See \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. These increases are offset by a decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($265 million). The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $262 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily an increase in notes payable ($1,042 million) (see \"Short-Term Borrowing\" in Note D to the financial statements in Item 8) and a higher system benefit charge ($86 million). The liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters - Climate Change\u201d in Item 1. This is offset in part by lower debt due within one year ($725 million) (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above) and lower accounts payable ($80 million).\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $313 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($433 million), which reflects primarily accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. It also reflects an increase in the regulatory liability for TCJA net benefits ($411 million) that were due to the Utilities' deferral of estimated net benefits under the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. These increases are offset by a decrease in the liability for pension and retiree benefits to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($188 million). The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2018. See Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. It also includes a decrease in the regulatory liability for pension and other postretirement benefit deferrals ($141 million), unrecognized other postretirement costs ($85 million), property tax reconciliation ($71 million), and net unbilled revenue deferrals ($66 million). The NYSPSC has authorized CECONY to accrue unbilled electric, gas and steam revenues. CECONY has deferred the net margin on the unbilled revenues for the future benefit of customers by recording a regulatory liability for the difference between the unbilled revenues and energy cost liabilities. See \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $1,611 million higher than at December 31, 2017.

The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. The change also reflects a decrease in the regulatory asset for environmental remediation costs ($22 million), property tax reconciliation ($11 million) and transition bond charges ($7 million). The decreases are offset by an increase in the regulatory asset for deferred storm costs ($38 million) related to response and restoration costs, other than capital expenditures, in connection with Superstorm Sandy and other major storms that were deferred.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $20 million lower than at December 31, 2017.

The change in noncurrent liabilities is related to the completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $1,066 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in long-term debt reflects primarily an increase in non-recourse debt secured by the pledge of the applicable renewable energy production projects. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above and Notes C and U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $997 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily a capital contribution from parent ($713 million), net income for the year ($145 million) and an increase in noncontrolling interest ($106 million). See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCET\nCurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $37 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in current assets reflects primarily a decrease in receivable from associate companies related to increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. See \"Con Edison Transmission - CET Gas\" in Item 1.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $241 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. See \"Investments\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 was $18 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, which reflects primarily accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $187 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily net income for the year ($47 million) and a capital contribution from parent ($150 million), offset by a common stock dividend to parent ($10 million) in 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn November 2018, Con Edison entered into forward sale agreements which meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. See Note C to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information on these agreements.\nNone of the Companies' other transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRegulatory Matters\nFor information about the Utilities' rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation\u201d in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nRisk Factors\nThe Companies' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments.\nAccounting for Regulated Public Utilities\nThe Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> <td>79\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges, or regulatory assets,\u201d under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits, or regulatory liabilities,\u201d under the accounting rules for regulated operations.\nThe Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.\nIn the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2018, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $4,370 million and $3,987 million, respectively.\nAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission also provide such benefits to certain employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies' pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nThe discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody's or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.\nIn determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.\nThe cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison's and CECONY's current estimates for 2019 are decreases, compared with 2018, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $146 million and $137 million, respectively.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on 2019 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>80\n</td> <td>CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>Change in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\nPostretirement\nBenefits\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in accounting cost:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$51\n</td> <td>$3\n</td> <td>$54\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$48\n</td> <td>$2\n</td> <td>$50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$34\n</td> <td>$2\n</td> <td>$36\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$32\n</td> <td>$2\n</td> <td>$34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care trend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3\n</td> <td>$3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(3)\n</td> <td>$(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in projected benefit obligation:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$527\n</td> <td>$32\n</td> <td>$559\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$496\n</td> <td>$24\n</td> <td>$520\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care trend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$9\n</td> <td>$9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(18)\n</td> <td>$(18)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2019, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.00 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $23 million and $21 million, respectively, in 2020.\nPension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.\nThe Companies' policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2018 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2018 of $434 million and $39 million, respectively. In 2019, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $301 million and $31 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions\u201d in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nThe accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers' compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.\nAccounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> <td>81\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ndisposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.\nIn January 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of Con Edison Development's PG&E Projects is sold under PG&E PPAs. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet included $885 million of net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects, $1,125 million of intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs, $292 million of net non-utility plant of additional projects that secure the related project debt and $1,050 million of related project debt. Con Edison has tested whether its net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects and intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs has been impaired. Based on the test, Con Edison has determined that there was no impairment. For other long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives, Con Edison recorded $2 million of impairment charges in 2018, and no impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Clean Energy Businesses - Con Edison Development,\u201d in Item 1 and Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\u201d in Note A and \"Long-term Debt\" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Goodwill\nIn accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. The company has an option to first make a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events and circumstances, such as industry and market conditions, regulatory environment and financial performance. If, after applying the optional qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company then applies a two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $440 million. No material impairment charges on goodwill were recognized in 2018 or 2017. Con Edison recognized a $15 million impairment charge in 2016. See Goodwill\u201d in Note A and Note K to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nThe Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. The Clean Energy Businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks,\u201d below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.\nWhere the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.\nFinancial and Commodity Market Risks\nThe Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2018, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $10 million. Under CECONY's current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable-rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.\nCommodity Price Risk\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>82\n</td> <td>CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCon Edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCon Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2018, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $74 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $66 million is for CECONY and $8 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs\u201d in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Clean Energy Businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was as follows:\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average for the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Risk\nThe Companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,\u201d above and Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 45 to 55 percent equity securities, 33 to 43 percent debt securities and 10 to 14 percent real estate. At December 31, 2018, the pension plan investments consisted of 51 percent equity securities, 39 percent debt securities and 10 percent real estate.\nFor the Utilities' pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. Generally, O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its rate plans.\nEnvironmental Matters\nFor information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n</td> <td>83\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaterial Contingencies\nFor information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies' material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: Con Edison and CECONY, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto.

As a result, Con Edison decreased its net deferred tax liabilities by $5,312 million, recognized $259 million in net income, decreased its regulatory asset for future income tax by $1,250 million, decreased its regulatory asset for revenue taxes by $90 million and accrued a regulatory liability for future income tax of $3,713 million. The amount recognized in net income for the \n 50 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nClean Energy Businesses, Con Edison Transmission and the parent company was $269 million, $11 million and $(21) million, respectively. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\n (d) Other includes parent company and consolidation adjustments. Net income includes $(42) million or $(0.14) a share of income tax expense resulting from a re-measurement of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities following the issuance of proposed regulations relating to the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes $(8) million or $(0.02) a share of the after-tax transaction costs related to a Con Edison Development subsidiary's purchase of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC.

statements in Item 8.\n 72 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect primarily their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See \"Utility Regulation - State Utility Regulation - New York Utility Industry - Reforming the Energy Vision,\" \"Competition\" and \"Environmental Matters - Climate Change\" in Item 1. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs\u201d in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA results in decreased cash flows from operating activities. See Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies,\u201d in Item 1A, Federal Income Tax\u201d in Note A, Rate Plans\u201d in Note B, Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies' cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans - CECONY- Electric and Gas\" and \"Rate Plans - O&R New York - Electric and Gas\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. For Con Edison, 2018 net income also includes a non-cash gain recognized with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC at the Clean Energy Businesses ($131 million). See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $672 million and $662 million lower, respectively, than in 2017. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily cash payments for MTA power reliability costs ($179 million and $179 million, respectively) and Puerto Rico related restoration costs ($104 million and $98 million, respectively), storm restoration costs ($193 million and $133 million, respectively), higher accounts receivable from customers ($149 million and $168 million, respectively) primarily due to an increase in billed revenues for gas, higher pension and retiree benefit obligations ($89 million and $77 million, respectively), and lower income tax refunds received, net of income taxes paid ($29 million and $87 million, respectively). The change in net cash flows for CECONY also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($195 million) primarily related to estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY's ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. The overpayment of estimated federal tax payments in 2018 will be settled in cash in 2019 when Con Edison files its extension for the 2018 federal tax return. These changes are offset in part by the cash impact of the Utilities' estimated net benefits in the 2018 period under the TCJA ($434 million and $411 million, respectively). See Assets, Liabilities and Equity,\u201d below.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $92 million and $172 million lower, respectively, than in 2016. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily higher cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, in 2017 as compared with 2016 of $151 million and $270 million, respectively. The income tax refund received in 2016 reflected the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015, resulting in a refund of the 2015 estimated federal tax payments. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY also reflects higher construction expenditures in accounts payable of $44 million and $56 million, respectively.\nThe change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable - customers, recoverable and refundable energy costs within other regulatory assets and liabilities and accounts payable balances.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,761 million and $226 million higher, respectively, in 2018 than in 2017. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily the acquisition of Sempra\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 73 \nSolar Holdings, LLC, net of cash acquired, at the Clean Energy Businesses ($1,488 million) (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8), higher new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($204 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($211 million) and O&R ($10 million), offset in part by lower non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($169 million).\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,240 million lower and $327 million higher, respectively, in 2017 than in 2016. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily lower new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($1,032 million) and renewable electric production projects at the Clean Energy Businesses ($349 million) and a decrease in non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($430 million), offset in part by lower proceeds from the sale of assets at the Clean Energy Businesses ($201 million) and transfer of assets to NY Transco at CECONY ($122 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($168 million) and O&R ($22 million).\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $2,581 million and $950 million higher, respectively, than in 2017. Net cash flows from financing activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $988 million lower and $680 million higher, respectively, than in 2016.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the following Con Edison transactions:\n \u2022 Issued 9,324,123 common shares for $705 million pursuant to forward sale agreements and borrowed $825 million under a variable rate term loan, which amounts, along with $79 million of other company funds, were used to pay the purchase price for the acquisition by a Con Edison Development subsidiary of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. In February 2019, the company repaid the $825 million term loan with borrowings under a two-year term loan agreement. See Notes C, D and U to the financial statements in Item 8. \n \u2022 Issued 4.1 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $343 million, after issuance expenses, that were invested by Con Edison in its subsidiaries, principally CECONY and the Clean Energy Businesses, for funding of their construction expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and \n \u2022 Issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2020, and prepaid the June 2016 $400 million variable rate term loan that was to mature in 2018. \n \u2022 Issued approximately 10 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $702 million, after issuance expenses, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2021, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used in connection with the acquisition by a CET Gas subsidiary of a 50 percent equity interest in Stagecoach, a gas pipeline and storage joint venture (see \"Con Edison Transmission\" in Item 1), and for general corporate purposes. \nCon Edison's cash flows from financing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 also reflect the proceeds, and reduction in cash used for reinvested dividends, resulting from the issuance of common shares under the company's dividend reinvestment, stock purchase and long-term incentive plans of $100 million, $97 million and $97 million, respectively.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the following CECONY transactions:\n \u2022 Issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00 percent debentures, due 2028, and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.65 percent debentures, due 2048, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to redeem at maturity $600 million of 7.125 percent 10-year debentures and other general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term debt; \n \u2022 Issued $640 million aggregate principal amount of debentures, due 2021, at a variable interest rate of 0.40 percent above three-month LIBOR and redeemed $636 million of its tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates were to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions; \n 74 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \n \u2022 Issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent debentures, due 2058, and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80 percent debentures, due 2028, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $600 million of 5.85 percent 10-year debentures. \n \u2022 Issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125 percent debentures, due 2027, $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00 percent debentures, due 2057, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 percent debentures, due 2047, the net proceeds from the sales of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 Issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.90 percent debentures, due 2026, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30 percent debentures, due 2056, and $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85 percent debentures, due 2046, the net proceeds from the sales of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $400 million of 5.50 percent 10-year debentures; and \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $250 million of 5.30 percent 10-year debentures.  Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 also reflect the following O&R transactions:\n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $50 million of 6.15 percent 10-year debentures; and \n \u2022 Issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of 4.35 percent debentures, due 2048, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. \nO&R had no issuances of long-term debt in 2017.\n \u2022 Issued $75 million aggregate principal amount of 3.88 percent debentures, due 2046, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings; and \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $75 million of 5.45 percent 10-year debentures.

The change in current assets reflects primarily an increase in customer accounts receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts ($154 million), reflecting primarily an increase in billed revenues for gas. It also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($150 million), reflecting primarily estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY's ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. The overpayment of estimated federal tax payments in 2018 will be settled in cash in 2019 when Con Edison files its extension for the 2018 federal tax return. It also reflects an increase to other receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts ($119 million), reflecting costs related to aid provided by the Utilities in the restoration of power in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of September 2017 hurricanes that have been billed to the appropriate authorities. As of December 31, 2018, CECONY's other receivables' balances related to such costs was $98 million. See \"Other Receivables\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $2 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily an increase in supplemental retirement income plan assets. See \"Investments\" in Note A and Note E to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet plant at December 31, 2018 was $2,165 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in net plant reflects primarily an increase in electric distribution ($720 million) and gas ($704 million) plant and construction work in progress ($348 million). At December 31, 2018, utility plant of CECONY included $95 million related to a May 2018 acquisition of software licenses. See \"Plant and Depreciation\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\n 76 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nOther noncurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $42 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily an increase in the regulatory asset for MTA power reliability deferral ($179 million) which reflects costs incurred and deferred as a regulatory asset in the 2018 period. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. It also reflects an increase in the regulatory asset for property tax reconciliation ($61 million), environmental remediation costs ($39 million) and revenues taxes ($30 million). Revenue taxes represent the timing difference between taxes collected and paid by CECONY to fund mass transportation. See \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. These increases are offset by a decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($265 million). The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $262 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily an increase in notes payable ($1,042 million) (see \"Short-Term Borrowing\" in Note D to the financial statements in Item 8) and a higher system benefit charge ($86 million). The liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters - Climate Change\u201d in Item 1. This is offset in part by lower debt due within one year ($725 million) (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above) and lower accounts payable ($80 million).\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $313 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($433 million), which reflects primarily accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. It also reflects an increase in the regulatory liability for TCJA net benefits ($411 million) that were due to the Utilities' deferral of estimated net benefits under the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. These increases are offset by a decrease in the liability for pension and retiree benefits to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($188 million). The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2018. See Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. It also includes a decrease in the regulatory liability for pension and other postretirement benefit deferrals ($141 million), unrecognized other postretirement costs ($85 million), property tax reconciliation ($71 million), and net unbilled revenue deferrals ($66 million). The NYSPSC has authorized CECONY to accrue unbilled electric, gas and steam revenues. CECONY has deferred the net margin on the unbilled revenues for the future benefit of customers by recording a regulatory liability for the difference between the unbilled revenues and energy cost liabilities. See \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $1,611 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in long-term debt reflects primarily debt issuances, offset in part by redemption of debt in 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $471 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily net income for the year ($1,196 million) and a capital contribution from parent ($120 million), offset in part by a common stock dividend to parent ($846 million) in 2018.\nO&R\nCurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $14 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in current assets reflects primarily an increase in customer accounts receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts, reflecting primarily an increase in billed revenues.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $4 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily a decrease in supplemental retirement income plan assets. See Note E to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet plant at December 31, 2018 was $142 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in net plant reflects primarily an increase in electric ($89 million) and gas ($47 million) plant balances.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 77 \nOther noncurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $33 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily a decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($23 million). The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. The change also reflects a decrease in the regulatory asset for environmental remediation costs ($22 million), property tax reconciliation ($11 million) and transition bond charges ($7 million). The decreases are offset by an increase in the regulatory asset for deferred storm costs ($38 million) related to response and restoration costs, other than capital expenditures, in connection with Superstorm Sandy and other major storms that were deferred.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $20 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily a decrease in notes payable ($42 million), offset in part by higher debt due within one year ($8 million) and a higher system benefit charge ($6 million). The liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters - Climate Change\u201d in Item 1.\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $6 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in the regulatory liability for TCJA net benefits ($23 million) that were due to the Utilities' deferral of estimated net benefits under the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The change also reflects an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($21 million), which primarily reflects accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The increases are offset by a decrease in the liability for pension and retiree benefits to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($27 million). The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2018.

The change in equity reflects primarily net income for the year ($47 million) and a capital contribution from parent ($150 million), offset by a common stock dividend to parent ($10 million) in 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn November 2018, Con Edison entered into forward sale agreements which meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. See Note C to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information on these agreements.\nNone of the Companies' other transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRegulatory Matters\nFor information about the Utilities' rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation\u201d in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nRisk Factors\nThe Companies' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments.\nAccounting for Regulated Public Utilities\nThe Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 79 \nThe accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges, or regulatory assets,\u201d under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits, or regulatory liabilities,\u201d under the accounting rules for regulated operations.\nThe Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.\nIn the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2018, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $4,370 million and $3,987 million, respectively.\nAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission also provide such benefits to certain employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies' pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nThe discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody's or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.\nIn determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.\nThe cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison's and CECONY's current estimates for 2019 are decreases, compared with 2018, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $146 million and $137 million, respectively.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on 2019 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:\n 80 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>Change in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\nPostretirement\nBenefits\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in accounting cost:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$51\n</td> <td>$3\n</td> <td>$54\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$48\n</td> <td>$2\n</td> <td>$50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$34\n</td> <td>$2\n</td> <td>$36\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$32\n</td> <td>$2\n</td> <td>$34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care trend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3\n</td> <td>$3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(3)\n</td> <td>$(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in projected benefit obligation:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$527\n</td> <td>$32\n</td> <td>$559\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$496\n</td> <td>$24\n</td> <td>$520\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care trend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$9\n</td> <td>$9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(18)\n</td> <td>$(18)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2019, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.00 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $23 million and $21 million, respectively, in 2020.\nPension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.\nThe Companies' policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2018 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2018 of $434 million and $39 million, respectively. In 2019, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $301 million and $31 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions\u201d in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nThe accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers' compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.\nAccounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 81 \ndisposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.\nIn January 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of Con Edison Development's PG&E Projects is sold under PG&E PPAs. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet included $885 million of net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects, $1,125 million of intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs, $292 million of net non-utility plant of additional projects that secure the related project debt and $1,050 million of related project debt. Con Edison has tested whether its net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects and intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs has been impaired. Based on the test, Con Edison has determined that there was no impairment. For other long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives, Con Edison recorded $2 million of impairment charges in 2018, and no impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Clean Energy Businesses - Con Edison Development,\u201d in Item 1 and Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\u201d in Note A and \"Long-term Debt\" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Goodwill\nIn accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. The company has an option to first make a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events and circumstances, such as industry and market conditions, regulatory environment and financial performance. If, after applying the optional qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company then applies a two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $440 million. No material impairment charges on goodwill were recognized in 2018 or 2017. Con Edison recognized a $15 million impairment charge in 2016. See Goodwill\u201d in Note A and Note K to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nThe Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. The Clean Energy Businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks,\u201d below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.\nWhere the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.\nFinancial and Commodity Market Risks\nThe Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2018, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $10 million. Under CECONY's current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable-rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.\nCommodity Price Risk\n 82 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nCon Edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCon Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2018, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $74 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $66 million is for CECONY and $8 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs\u201d in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Clean Energy Businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was as follows:\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average for the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Risk\nThe Companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,\u201d above and Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 45 to 55 percent equity securities, 33 to 43 percent debt securities and 10 to 14 percent real estate. At December 31, 2018, the pension plan investments consisted of 51 percent equity securities, 39 percent debt securities and 10 percent real estate.\nFor the Utilities' pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. Generally, O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its rate plans.\nEnvironmental Matters\nFor information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 83 \nMaterial Contingencies\nFor information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies' material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.", "item_7_text": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: Con Edison and CECONY, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto.

Renewable revenues increased $229 million due primarily to an increase in renewable electric production projects in operation and revenues from the engineering, procurement and construction of Upton 2 (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8). Energy services revenues increased $19 million. Wholesale revenues increased $128 million due to higher sales volumes. Net mark-to-market values decreased $6 million, of which $11 million in losses are reflected in purchased power costs and $5 million in gains are reflected in revenues.\nPurchased power expenses decreased $677 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to lower electric costs due to the sale of the retail electric supply business in September 2016 ($687 million), offset by changes in mark-to-market values ($11 million).\nGas purchased for resale increased $114 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due to higher purchased volumes.\nOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $149 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due to Upton 2 engineering, procurement and construction costs (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8) and an increase in energy services costs.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $32 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due to an increase in solar electric production projects in operation during 2017.\nTaxes, other than income taxes decreased $4 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due to lower gross receipts tax from the sale of the retail electric supply business in September 2016.\nGain on sale of retail electric supply business decreased $103 million in 2017 reflecting the sale of the retail electric supply business in 2016 (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8).\nOther Income (Deductions)\nOther income (deductions) increased $11 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to the impairment of goodwill in 2016 ($15 million) (see Note K to the financial statements in Item 8), offset in part by income from renewable electric production investments ($3 million).\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased $9 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to increased debt on renewable electric production projects.\n 70 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome taxes decreased $326 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to lower income before income tax expense ($45 million), the re-measurement of the Clean Energy Businesses' deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the 21 percent corporate income tax rate under the TCJA ($269 million), a higher favorable 2016 state return-to-provision adjustment recorded in 2017 ($7 million), higher renewable energy tax credits ($1 million) and the increase to deferred state income taxes in 2016 as a result of the sale of the retail electric supply business that increased the Clean Energy Businesses' state apportionment factor on its cumulative temporary differences ($4 million), offset in part by an increase in valuation allowances against state net operating loss carryforwards ($3 million). See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCon Edison Transmission\nOther operations and maintenance increased $7 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to CET having no employees or other direct costs until January 1, 2017.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased $10 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to an increased allocation from the parent company of interest expense resulting from a parent company debt issuance in May 2016.\nOther Income (Deductions)\nOther income (deductions) increased $37 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to earnings from equity investments in Stagecoach Gas Services, LLC, substantially all of which were made in June 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome taxes decreased $2 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to the re-measurement of Con Edison Transmission's deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the 21 percent corporate income tax rate under the TCJA ($11 million), offset in part by higher income before income tax expense ($9 million). See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\nOther\nFor Con Edison, Other\u201d includes the increase in income tax expense resulting from the re-measurement of Con Edison's deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the 21 percent corporate income tax rate under the TCJA ($21 million). See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. \"Other\" also includes intercompany eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting Con Edison's liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting CECONY's liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities' cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.\nEach of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements,\u201d \"Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies\" and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control\u201d in Item 1A, and Capital Requirements and Resources\u201d in Item 1.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 71 \nThe Companies' cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Includes parent company and consolidation adjustments.\n(b) Represents the consolidated results of operations of Con Edison and its businesses.\n(c) See \"Reconciliation of Cash, Temporary Cash Investments and Restricted Cash\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\n 72 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect primarily their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See \"Utility Regulation - State Utility Regulation - New York Utility Industry - Reforming the Energy Vision,\" \"Competition\" and \"Environmental Matters - Climate Change\" in Item 1. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs\u201d in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA results in decreased cash flows from operating activities. See Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies,\u201d in Item 1A, Federal Income Tax\u201d in Note A, Rate Plans\u201d in Note B, Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies' cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans - CECONY- Electric and Gas\" and \"Rate Plans - O&R New York - Electric and Gas\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. For Con Edison, 2018 net income also includes a non-cash gain recognized with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC at the Clean Energy Businesses ($131 million). See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $672 million and $662 million lower, respectively, than in 2017. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily cash payments for MTA power reliability costs ($179 million and $179 million, respectively) and Puerto Rico related restoration costs ($104 million and $98 million, respectively), storm restoration costs ($193 million and $133 million, respectively), higher accounts receivable from customers ($149 million and $168 million, respectively) primarily due to an increase in billed revenues for gas, higher pension and retiree benefit obligations ($89 million and $77 million, respectively), and lower income tax refunds received, net of income taxes paid ($29 million and $87 million, respectively). The change in net cash flows for CECONY also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($195 million) primarily related to estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY's ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. The overpayment of estimated federal tax payments in 2018 will be settled in cash in 2019 when Con Edison files its extension for the 2018 federal tax return. These changes are offset in part by the cash impact of the Utilities' estimated net benefits in the 2018 period under the TCJA ($434 million and $411 million, respectively). See Assets, Liabilities and Equity,\u201d below.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $92 million and $172 million lower, respectively, than in 2016. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily higher cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, in 2017 as compared with 2016 of $151 million and $270 million, respectively. The income tax refund received in 2016 reflected the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015, resulting in a refund of the 2015 estimated federal tax payments. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY also reflects higher construction expenditures in accounts payable of $44 million and $56 million, respectively.\nThe change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable - customers, recoverable and refundable energy costs within other regulatory assets and liabilities and accounts payable balances.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,761 million and $226 million higher, respectively, in 2018 than in 2017. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily the acquisition of Sempra\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 73 \nSolar Holdings, LLC, net of cash acquired, at the Clean Energy Businesses ($1,488 million) (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8), higher new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($204 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($211 million) and O&R ($10 million), offset in part by lower non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($169 million).\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,240 million lower and $327 million higher, respectively, in 2017 than in 2016. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily lower new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($1,032 million) and renewable electric production projects at the Clean Energy Businesses ($349 million) and a decrease in non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($430 million), offset in part by lower proceeds from the sale of assets at the Clean Energy Businesses ($201 million) and transfer of assets to NY Transco at CECONY ($122 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($168 million) and O&R ($22 million).\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $2,581 million and $950 million higher, respectively, than in 2017. Net cash flows from financing activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $988 million lower and $680 million higher, respectively, than in 2016.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the following Con Edison transactions:\n \u2022 Issued 9,324,123 common shares for $705 million pursuant to forward sale agreements and borrowed $825 million under a variable rate term loan, which amounts, along with $79 million of other company funds, were used to pay the purchase price for the acquisition by a Con Edison Development subsidiary of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. In February 2019, the company repaid the $825 million term loan with borrowings under a two-year term loan agreement. See Notes C, D and U to the financial statements in Item 8. \n \u2022 Issued 4.1 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $343 million, after issuance expenses, that were invested by Con Edison in its subsidiaries, principally CECONY and the Clean Energy Businesses, for funding of their construction expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and \n \u2022 Issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2020, and prepaid the June 2016 $400 million variable rate term loan that was to mature in 2018. \n \u2022 Issued approximately 10 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $702 million, after issuance expenses, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2021, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used in connection with the acquisition by a CET Gas subsidiary of a 50 percent equity interest in Stagecoach, a gas pipeline and storage joint venture (see \"Con Edison Transmission\" in Item 1), and for general corporate purposes. \nCon Edison's cash flows from financing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 also reflect the proceeds, and reduction in cash used for reinvested dividends, resulting from the issuance of common shares under the company's dividend reinvestment, stock purchase and long-term incentive plans of $100 million, $97 million and $97 million, respectively.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the following CECONY transactions:\n \u2022 Issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00 percent debentures, due 2028, and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.65 percent debentures, due 2048, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to redeem at maturity $600 million of 7.125 percent 10-year debentures and other general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term debt; \n \u2022 Issued $640 million aggregate principal amount of debentures, due 2021, at a variable interest rate of 0.40 percent above three-month LIBOR and redeemed $636 million of its tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates were to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions; \n 74 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \n \u2022 Issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent debentures, due 2058, and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80 percent debentures, due 2028, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $600 million of 5.85 percent 10-year debentures. \n \u2022 Issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125 percent debentures, due 2027, $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00 percent debentures, due 2057, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 percent debentures, due 2047, the net proceeds from the sales of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 Issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.90 percent debentures, due 2026, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30 percent debentures, due 2056, and $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85 percent debentures, due 2046, the net proceeds from the sales of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $400 million of 5.50 percent 10-year debentures; and \n \u2022 Redeemed at maturity $250 million of 5.30 percent 10-year debentures.

The change in current assets reflects primarily an increase in customer accounts receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts ($154 million), reflecting primarily an increase in billed revenues for gas. It also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($150 million), reflecting primarily estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY's ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. The overpayment of estimated federal tax payments in 2018 will be settled in cash in 2019 when Con Edison files its extension for the 2018 federal tax return. It also reflects an increase to other receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts ($119 million), reflecting costs related to aid provided by the Utilities in the restoration of power in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of September 2017 hurricanes that have been billed to the appropriate authorities. As of December 31, 2018, CECONY's other receivables' balances related to such costs was $98 million. See \"Other Receivables\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $2 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily an increase in supplemental retirement income plan assets. See \"Investments\" in Note A and Note E to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet plant at December 31, 2018 was $2,165 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in net plant reflects primarily an increase in electric distribution ($720 million) and gas ($704 million) plant and construction work in progress ($348 million). At December 31, 2018, utility plant of CECONY included $95 million related to a May 2018 acquisition of software licenses. See \"Plant and Depreciation\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\n 76 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nOther noncurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $42 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily an increase in the regulatory asset for MTA power reliability deferral ($179 million) which reflects costs incurred and deferred as a regulatory asset in the 2018 period. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. It also reflects an increase in the regulatory asset for property tax reconciliation ($61 million), environmental remediation costs ($39 million) and revenues taxes ($30 million). Revenue taxes represent the timing difference between taxes collected and paid by CECONY to fund mass transportation. See \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. These increases are offset by a decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($265 million). The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $262 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily an increase in notes payable ($1,042 million) (see \"Short-Term Borrowing\" in Note D to the financial statements in Item 8) and a higher system benefit charge ($86 million). The liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters - Climate Change\u201d in Item 1. This is offset in part by lower debt due within one year ($725 million) (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above) and lower accounts payable ($80 million).\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $313 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($433 million), which reflects primarily accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. It also reflects an increase in the regulatory liability for TCJA net benefits ($411 million) that were due to the Utilities' deferral of estimated net benefits under the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. These increases are offset by a decrease in the liability for pension and retiree benefits to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($188 million). The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2018. See Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. It also includes a decrease in the regulatory liability for pension and other postretirement benefit deferrals ($141 million), unrecognized other postretirement costs ($85 million), property tax reconciliation ($71 million), and net unbilled revenue deferrals ($66 million). The NYSPSC has authorized CECONY to accrue unbilled electric, gas and steam revenues. CECONY has deferred the net margin on the unbilled revenues for the future benefit of customers by recording a regulatory liability for the difference between the unbilled revenues and energy cost liabilities. See \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $1,611 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in long-term debt reflects primarily debt issuances, offset in part by redemption of debt in 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $471 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily net income for the year ($1,196 million) and a capital contribution from parent ($120 million), offset in part by a common stock dividend to parent ($846 million) in 2018.\nO&R\nCurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $14 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in current assets reflects primarily an increase in customer accounts receivables, less allowance for uncollectible accounts, reflecting primarily an increase in billed revenues.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $4 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily a decrease in supplemental retirement income plan assets. See Note E to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet plant at December 31, 2018 was $142 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in net plant reflects primarily an increase in electric ($89 million) and gas ($47 million) plant balances.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 77 \nOther noncurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $33 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily a decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($23 million). The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. The change also reflects a decrease in the regulatory asset for environmental remediation costs ($22 million), property tax reconciliation ($11 million) and transition bond charges ($7 million). The decreases are offset by an increase in the regulatory asset for deferred storm costs ($38 million) related to response and restoration costs, other than capital expenditures, in connection with Superstorm Sandy and other major storms that were deferred.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $20 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily a decrease in notes payable ($42 million), offset in part by higher debt due within one year ($8 million) and a higher system benefit charge ($6 million). The liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters - Climate Change\u201d in Item 1.\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $6 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in the regulatory liability for TCJA net benefits ($23 million) that were due to the Utilities' deferral of estimated net benefits under the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The change also reflects an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($21 million), which primarily reflects accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The increases are offset by a decrease in the liability for pension and retiree benefits to reflect the final actuarial valuation, as measured at December 31, 2018, of the pension and other retiree benefit plans in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits ($27 million). The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2018. It also reflects a decrease in Superfund and other environmental costs ($15 million). See Notes E, F and G to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $87 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in long-term debt reflects primarily debt issuances, offset in part by redemption of debt in 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $46 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily net income for the year ($59 million), a capital contribution from parent ($25 million), offset in part by a common stock dividend to parent ($46 million) in 2018.\nClean Energy Businesses\nCurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $158 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in current assets reflects primarily an increase in receivables from associate companies related to the completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See Notes Q and U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $475 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily the decrease in Con Edison Development equity method investments due to the completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See \"Investments\" in Note A and Notes Q and U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet plant at December 31, 2018 was $1,843 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in net plant reflects primarily an increase in property, plant and equipment related to the completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See \"Non-Utility Plant\" in Note A and Notes Q and U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nOther noncurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $1,560 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily an increase in intangible assets arising from power purchase agreements related to the completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\" in Note A and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $981 million higher than at December 31, 2017.

See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above and Notes D and U to the financial statements in Item 8.\n 78 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $42 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities is related to the completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $1,066 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in long-term debt reflects primarily an increase in non-recourse debt secured by the pledge of the applicable renewable energy production projects. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" above and Notes C and U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $997 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily a capital contribution from parent ($713 million), net income for the year ($145 million) and an increase in noncontrolling interest ($106 million). See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCET\nCurrent assets at December 31, 2018 were $37 million lower than at December 31, 2017. The change in current assets reflects primarily a decrease in receivable from associate companies related to increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. See \"Con Edison Transmission - CET Gas\" in Item 1.\nInvestments at December 31, 2018 were $241 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in investments reflects primarily increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. See \"Investments\" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNoncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2018 was $18 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, which reflects primarily accelerated tax depreciation (including the Utilities' 2017 return-to-accrual adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2018) and repair deductions.\nEquity at December 31, 2018 was $187 million higher than at December 31, 2017. The change in equity reflects primarily net income for the year ($47 million) and a capital contribution from parent ($150 million), offset by a common stock dividend to parent ($10 million) in 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn November 2018, Con Edison entered into forward sale agreements which meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. See Note C to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information on these agreements.\nNone of the Companies' other transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRegulatory Matters\nFor information about the Utilities' rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation\u201d in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nRisk Factors\nThe Companies' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments.\nAccounting for Regulated Public Utilities\nThe Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 79 \nThe accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges, or regulatory assets,\u201d under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits, or regulatory liabilities,\u201d under the accounting rules for regulated operations.\nThe Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.\nIn the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2018, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $4,370 million and $3,987 million, respectively.\nAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission also provide such benefits to certain employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies' pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nThe discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody's or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.\nIn determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.\nThe cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison's and CECONY's current estimates for 2019 are decreases, compared with 2018, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $146 million and $137 million, respectively.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on 2019 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:\n 80 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \n\nA 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2019, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.00 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $23 million and $21 million, respectively, in 2020.\nPension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.\nThe Companies' policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2018 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2018 of $434 million and $39 million, respectively. In 2019, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $301 million and $31 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions\u201d in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nThe accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers' compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.\nAccounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 81 \ndisposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.\nIn January 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of Con Edison Development's PG&E Projects is sold under PG&E PPAs. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet included $885 million of net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects, $1,125 million of intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs, $292 million of net non-utility plant of additional projects that secure the related project debt and $1,050 million of related project debt. Con Edison has tested whether its net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects and intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs has been impaired. Based on the test, Con Edison has determined that there was no impairment. For other long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives, Con Edison recorded $2 million of impairment charges in 2018, and no impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Clean Energy Businesses - Con Edison Development,\u201d in Item 1 and Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\u201d in Note A and \"Long-term Debt\" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Goodwill\nIn accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. The company has an option to first make a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events and circumstances, such as industry and market conditions, regulatory environment and financial performance. If, after applying the optional qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company then applies a two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $440 million. No material impairment charges on goodwill were recognized in 2018 or 2017. Con Edison recognized a $15 million impairment charge in 2016. See Goodwill\u201d in Note A and Note K to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nThe Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. The Clean Energy Businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks,\u201d below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.\nWhere the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.\nFinancial and Commodity Market Risks\nThe Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2018, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $10 million. Under CECONY's current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable-rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.\nCommodity Price Risk\n 82 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 \nCon Edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCon Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2018, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $74 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $66 million is for CECONY and $8 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs\u201d in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Clean Energy Businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was as follows:\n\nInvestment Risk\nThe Companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,\u201d above and Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 45 to 55 percent equity securities, 33 to 43 percent debt securities and 10 to 14 percent real estate. At December 31, 2018, the pension plan investments consisted of 51 percent equity securities, 39 percent debt securities and 10 percent real estate.\nFor the Utilities' pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates.

Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.\n CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 83 \nMaterial Contingencies\nFor information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies' material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.", "item_7_tables": "Table 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept percentages)\n</td> <td>Operating\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>$10,680\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$1,196\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$43,108\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>O&R\n</td> <td>891\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Utilities\n</td> <td>11,571\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>46,000\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Energy Businesses (a) (b)\n</td> <td>763\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>5,821\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison Transmission\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,425\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (c)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(65)\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>674\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Con Edison\n</td> <td>$12,337\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$1,382\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$53,920\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept per share amounts)\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Earnings per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY\n</td> <td>$1,196\n</td> <td>$1,104\n</td> <td>$1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>O&R\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Energy Businesses (a)(b)(c)\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison Transmission (c)\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (c)(d)\n</td> <td>(65)\n</td> <td>(19)\n</td> <td>(8)\n</td> <td>(0.21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.03\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Con Edison (e)\n</td> <td>$1,382\n</td> <td>$1,525\n</td> <td>$1,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Variation for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Earnings\nper Share\n</td> <td>Net Income\n(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CECONY (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in rate plans\n</td> <td>$0.84\n</td> <td>$258\n</td> <td>Reflects primarily higher electric and gas net base revenues of $0.59 a share and $0.16 a share, respectively, and growth in the number of gas customers of $0.06 a share.

subsidiaries CECONY, O&R, Clean Energy Businesses, and Con Edison Transmission. It discusses their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital requirements, and other factors affecting their businesses.\n\n- For 2018, Con Edison had net income of $1.4 billion on operating revenues of $12.3 billion. CECONY accounted for most of the net income and operating revenues.\n\n- Major factors affecting 2018 results include changes in rate plans, weather impacts, operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, taxes, and interest costs. \n\n- Cash flows from operations in 2018 were lower than 2017 primarily due to payments for storm restoration, higher accounts receivable, and pension contributions. Cash used in investing activities was higher mainly due to the Clean Energy Businesses' acquisition of Sempra Solar.\n\n- Total assets increased in 2018 primarily due to the Sempra Solar acquisition. Long-term debt increased due to new debt issuances. \n\n- Key risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, investment risk, and uncertainties related to public utility regulation and environmental matters.\n\n- Critical accounting policies involve accounting for regulated public utilities, pensions, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivatives. Estimates and assumptions in these areas can significantly impact financial results.\n\nIn summary, the report provides an overview of Con Edison's financial performance and discusses key factors impacting the business and results of operations. It highlights risks, uncertainties, and critical accounting policies that are important to understand Con Edison's financial statements."}
