Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nExecutive Summary\nHines Global REIT, Inc. ( Hines Global\u201d) was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Laws on December 10, 2008, primarily for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global raised the equity capital for its real estate investments through two public offerings from August 2009 through April 2014, and through its distribution reinvestment plan (the DRP Offering\u201d) from April 2014 through August 2018. Collectively, through its public offerings, Hines Global raised gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion, including the DRP Offering, all of which was invested in the Company's real estate portfolio.\nWe invested the proceeds from our public offerings into a diverse portfolio of real estate investments. In recent years, we have concentrated our efforts on actively managing our assets and exploring a variety of strategic opportunities focused on enhancing the composition of our portfolio and its total return potential for its stockholders. On April 23, 2018, in connection with its review of potential strategic alternatives available to the Company, our board of directors determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to sell all or substantially all of our properties and assets and for the Company to liquidate and dissolve pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. The principal purpose of the liquidation is to provide liquidity to our stockholders by selling the Company's assets, paying its debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. As required by Maryland law and our charter, the Plan of Liquidation was approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on July 17, 2018.\nIn April 2018, our board of directors estimated that, in addition to regular operating distributions paid to our stockholders, if we are able to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation, then after the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the payment of all of the our outstanding liabilities, we will have made total Return of Capital distributions to our stockholders of approximately $10.00 to $11.00 per share of the Company's common stock, consisting of three components: (i) the $1.05 per share special distribution paid to stockholders in January 2018; (ii) the $0.12 per share of return on invested capital distributions paid to stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2018; and (iii) the range of liquidating distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation of $8.83 to $9.83 per share, estimated by our board of directors in April 2018, and we have made liquidating distributions of approximately $2.83 per share to date.\nFrom January 2018 through February 2019, we paid Return of Capital Distributions to our stockholders totaling approximately $4.00, consisting of the $1.05 per share Special Distribution paid in January 2018, the $0.12 per share Return of Invested Capital Distributions paid for the six months ended June 30, 2018, $0.33 per share monthly liquidating distributions paid between August 2018 and January 2019, and the $2.50 per share liquidating distribution paid in February 2019. We have been working diligently to successfully execute the Plan of Liquidation. Our original goal was to complete the liquidation and make final distributions to our stockholders by July 17, 2020 (24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation). While we have been actively marketing the remaining assets for disposition, the recent spread of the COVID-19 (more commonly referred to as the Coronavirus) pandemic and its impact on the global economic environment has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on overall market conditions and our disposition process. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact to the process or timing, but we remain very thoughtful in proactively positioning our portfolio to be flexible and adaptable to the evolving circumstances. Accordingly, there can be no assurances regarding the timing or amounts of any further liquidating distributions, that we will ultimately pay aggregate liquidating distributions within the range estimated by our board of directors when it approved the Plan of Liquidation in April 2018, or that we will make the final distribution on or before July 17, 2020. If we are unable to complete the liquidation and make final distributions to our stockholders by July 17, 2020, we expect that any remaining assets and liabilities of the Company would be transferred into a liquidating trust as described in the Plan of Liquidation approved by our stockholders in July 2018. In addition, even if we sell\nall of our assets by July 17, 2020, we may determine not to distribute all distributable cash by that date and may establish a reserve to provide for any remaining obligations and to cover our expenses as we complete our wind down and dissolution.\nAt the peak of our acquisition phase, we owned interests in 45 properties. We sold interests in six properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.0 billion during 2017, 20 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.7 billion during 2018, four properties for an aggregate sales prices of $1.3 billion during 2019 and two additional properties through March 30, 2020 for an aggregate sales price of $379.9 million. Following these sales, we owned eight properties. Approximately 64% of our remaining portfolio is located throughout the United States and approximately 36% is located internationally. Additionally, our remaining portfolio is comprised of investments in approximately 41% office and 59% retail.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, application of our accounting policies involves exercising judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Property and Lease Intangibles\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected operating cash flows and expected proceeds from the eventual disposition of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, it would be written down to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. The determination of whether investment property is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of the evaluation.\nIn July 2019, we determined that all of our real estate properties and their related assets and associated liabilities should be classified as held for sale. As a result of the held for sale classification, amounts related to assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Also, as a result of the held for sale classification, we have stopped recording depreciation and amortization to the assets held for sale and their related liabilities as of July 2019.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded total impairment charges of $122.6 million, $19.2 million, and $7.1 million, respectively.\nDeferred Leasing Costs\nDirect leasing costs, primarily consisting of third-party leasing commissions and tenant inducements are capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease. Tenant inducement amortization is recorded as an offset to rental revenue and the amortization of other direct leasing costs is recorded in amortization expense. We consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes. These factors include: (i) whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; (ii) whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements; (iii) the uniqueness of the improvements; (iv) the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the term of the lease; and (v) who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements. The determination of who owns the tenant improvements for accounting purposes is subject to significant judgment. In making that determination, we consider all of the above factors. No one factor, however, necessarily establishes any determination. Further, as a result of the held for sale designation, no amortization was recorded after July 2019.\nRevenue Recognition and Valuation of Receivables\nWe are required to recognize minimum rent revenues on a straight-line basis over the terms of tenant leases, including rent holidays and bargain renewal options, if any. Revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant's lease provision. Leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations to the computation. We make quarterly accrual adjustments, positive or negative, to tenant reimbursement revenue to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term and are included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we will record a receivable for rent not yet due under the lease terms. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, to what extent the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables, at a portfolio level, are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, an allowance for the uncollectible portion of tenant and other receivables was determined and recognized based upon an analysis of the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically our most significant demands for funds were related to the purchase of real estate properties and other real estate-related investments. Specifically, we funded $5.1 billion of real estate investments using $3.1 billion of proceeds from our public offerings, including the DRP offerings, and debt proceeds. We invested all of the proceeds raised through our public offerings by the end of 2015. As a result, any real estate investments we made since that time were funded using proceeds from the dispositions of other real estate investments, debt proceeds, or our distribution reinvestment plan. Our significant demands for funds include the payment of operating expenses and debt service. Generally, we expect to meet these operating cash needs using cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the revolver, and cash on hand. However, as described further below, we intend to repay certain indebtedness that is coming due over the next year with proceeds from asset sales pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation, which will reduce the amount of cash available for liquidating distributions to our stockholders.\nAdditionally, as described previously, we have commenced the Plan of Liquidation in July 2018, and have been selling our properties and have distributed proceeds from the sale of our properties to our stockholders in the form of liquidating distributions at that time. We received proceeds from the sale of 28 properties from 2017 through February 2019, which were used to make Return of Capital distributions totaling $1.1 billion from January 2018 through February 2019 (approximately $4.00 per share). No additional distributions have been made since February 2019. Additionally, we sold four properties in late 2019 and early 2020 and used the proceeds to drastically reduce our leverage, as indicated below.\nBecause we had already sold a significant number of assets and our expectation is to sell the remaining assets in the time frame anticipated under the Plan of Liquidation, we stopped paying monthly distributions after December 2018. We intend to fund all future distributions with proceeds from the sale of our remaining properties and any future distributable income earned from the operating income or the sale of the remaining properties is expected to be included in the future liquidating distributions to the shareholders.\nWe believe that the proper use of leverage can enhance returns on real estate investments. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio was 23% leveraged, based on the values of our real estate investments. At that time, we had $537.8 million of principal outstanding under our various loan agreements with a weighted average interest rate of 3.0%, including the effects of related interest rate caps. Following the sales of two additional properties through March 30, 2020, our portfolio remained approximately 12% leveraged based on the values of our real estate investments. As of March 30, 2020, we have $234.3 million of debt scheduled to mature within a year. We intend to either refinance these loans, or repay these loans using proceeds from the sale of our real estate investments and available cash on hand.\nThe discussions below provide additional details regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Property-level operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages of property management personnel, utilities, cleaning, insurance, security and building maintenance costs, property management and leasing fees, and property taxes. Additionally, we pay general and administrative expenses, acquisition fees and expenses and asset management fees, which also reduce our operating cash flows.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.2 million compared to $2.5 million used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating cash flows have increased due to less deferred lease costs paid during 2019 compared to 2018, which was partially offset by decreases due to the dispositions of 20 properties in 2018 and four properties in 2019.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash from investing activities primarily relates to proceeds received from the sales of our real estate investments, capital expenditures at our properties, and activities related to our loans receivable. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $270.5 million compared to the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of property sales in each period:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We received proceeds of $1.1 billion from the sale of four properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.

In December 2018, the Board determined to suspend our share redemption program, effective February 2, 2019, except for redemption requests related to the death or disability of the stockholder. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we redeemed $30.3 million and $124.0 million in shares of our common stock through our share redemption program.\nDistributions\nAs described previously, we have declared distributions of approximately $0.65 per share (approximately $0.0541667 per share, per month) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $0.45 per share of these distributions were designated as a return of a portion of the stockholders' invested capital as further described below. Distributions were paid monthly on or around the first business day following the completion of each month to which they relate. All distributions were paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for those participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the suspension of our distribution reinvestment plan, all distributions paid after August 31, 2018 were paid to our stockholders in cash.\nFrom January 2018 through February 2019, we paid aggregate Return of Capital Distributions to stockholders totaling approximately $4.00 per share, which represent a portion of the stockholders' invested capital. These Return of Capital Distributions reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company and were made up of the following:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $1.05 per share Special Distribution declared to all stockholders of record as of December 30, 2017 and paid in January 2018.

expenses, real property taxes, and property management fees: These amounts related directly to the operations of our real estate investments. The decrease in these amounts is primarily due to the disposition of real estate investments during 2019. We disposed of four real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 20 real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2018. Please refer to our Same-store Analysis below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization: The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the disposition of real estate investments during 2018 and 2019, as described above.\nAsset management fees: We pay monthly asset management fees to the Advisor based on an annual fee of 1.5% of the net equity capital invested in real estate, which may be affected by the timing of the property sales, amounts of equity invested in properties that are sold, capital expenditures and changes in the leverage of our properties. Asset management fees decreased during 2019 as a result of the 24 property dispositions in 2018 and 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses include legal and accounting fees, printing and mailing costs, insurance costs, costs and expenses associated with our board of directors and other administrative expenses. The\ndecrease is due to the sale of 24 properties during 2018 and 2019 and the increased costs incurred in 2018 related to our plan of liquidation.\nImpairment losses: For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $115.4 million on six of our properties (in connection with designating our remaining properties as held for sale). The amount of the impairment charges represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the estimated net realizable value for each of these six properties. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, prior to the designating our properties as held for sale, we determined that one of our investment properties was impaired based on deteriorating market conditions. As a result, an impairment loss of $7.2 million was recorded to write down the carrying values to fair value as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that three of our investment properties were impaired as a result of deteriorating market conditions. As a result, an impairment loss of $19.2 million was recorded to write down its carrying value to its fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments: The loss on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to timing differences for the foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into related to the sales of our properties. The gain on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the net gain from the foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into related to the sales of our properties in Australia, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom during the year.\nGain on sale of real estate: The gain on sale of real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was due to the sale of four properties during 2019 and 20 properties during 2018, respectively.\nForeign currency gains (losses): See below under Same-Store Analysis for a description of the changes related to foreign currency gains (losses).\nInterest expense: The decrease in the interest expense in the table above is primarily due to our lower total debt principal in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes: The change in provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is a result of changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to book / tax timing differences at our international subsidiaries.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes related to sale of real estate: The provision for income taxes related to sale of real estate is due to taxes recognized upon the sale of German Logistics Properties and the Australia Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no provision for income taxes related to sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame-store Analysis\nWe evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned for the full periods presented. The following table presents the property-level revenues in excess of expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, by reportable segment. Same-store properties for the year ended December 31, 2019 include 10 properties owned as of January 1, 2018 that were 87% leased as of December 31, 2019 compared to 83% leased as of December 31, 2018. In total, property revenues in excess of expenses of the same-store properties decreased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The same-store comparison includes the results of operations of Riverside Center and Perspective Defense, all of which were sold subsequent to December 31, 2019. Below is additional information regarding our same-store results and significant variances from the prior year. Most of our leases are net leases, which provide for the recovery of most operating expenses, property taxes and management fees at our properties. As a result, we believe it is beneficial to analyze our same-store results on a net basis, as shown below.

The financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date while income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity until the properties are sold and the gains or losses are realized.\nBy contrast, gains and losses related to transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency are recorded in foreign currency gains (losses) on the consolidated statement of operations. An exception is made where an intercompany loan or advance is deemed to be of a long-term investment nature, in which instance foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these gains/losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring our borrowings denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies and the changes to the related exchange rates between the date of the borrowing and the end of each period. These gains or losses exclude $36.8 million and $58.3 million of losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which related to the sale of our properties and were included in the gain (loss) on sale of real estate investments\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management's view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that due to the limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. We adopted ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018. Prior to ASU 2017-01, real estate acquisitions were generally considered business combinations and the acquisition-related expenses and acquisition fees were treated as operating expenses under GAAP.\nIn addition to FFO, management uses Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), as defined by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives (the IPA\u201d), as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate our operating performance. The IPA has recommended the use of MFFO as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs to enhance the assessment of the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be useful as a measure of the long-term operating performance of our investments or as a comparative measure to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended and described herein. MFFO includes funds generated by the operations of our real estate investments and funds used in our corporate-level operations. MFFO is based on FFO, but includes certain additional adjustments which we believe are appropriate. Such items include reversing the effects of straight-line rent revenue recognition, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and certain other items as described below. Some of these adjustments are necessary to address changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO. These changes also have prompted a significant increase in the magnitude of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined. Such items include amortization of out-of-market lease intangible assets and liabilities and certain tenant incentives.\nOther adjustments included in MFFO are necessary to address issues that are common to publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations. While other start-up entities may also experience\nsignificant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs like us are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nThe purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, including acquisition fees and expenses, was a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to our stockholders. MFFO excludes any acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses. As described above, prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses were characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses were paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds were not available to distribute to our stockholders. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties were being acquired. Since MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses related to all of our acquisitions, MFFO would only be comparable to the operations of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.\nManagement uses MFFO to evaluate the financial performance of our investment portfolio, including the impact of potential future investments. In addition, management uses MFFO to evaluate and establish our distribution policy and the sustainability thereof. Further, we believe MFFO is one of several measures that may be useful to investors in evaluating the potential performance of our portfolio following the conclusion of the acquisition phase, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses incurred prior to January 1, 2018, as described herein.\nMFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nFFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and MFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of MFFO:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MFFO excluded acquisition fees paid to our Advisor and acquisition expenses for periods prior to January 1, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared no operating distributions (excluding $661.2 million of liquidating distributions declared in February 2019) to our stockholders, compared to total aggregate FFO of $47.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we declared operating distributions to our stockholders totaling $56.0 million and $179.6 million, respectively, compared to total aggregate FFO of $72.1 million and $167.3 million, respectively. Our board of directors does not intend to declare additional operating distributions, and intends for all future distributions to be liquidating distributions. During our offering and investment stages, we incurred acquisition fees and expenses in connection with our real estate investments, which were recorded as reductions to net income and FFO. From inception through December 31, 2019, we incurred acquisition fees and expenses totaling $223.2 million.\nAs noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been insufficient to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions may continue to be paid from other sources, such as proceeds from the sale of real estate investments and/or cash flows from financing activities. We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these sources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with the Advisor, Dealer Manager and Hines or its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities during the various phases of our organization and operation. During the organization and offering stage, these included payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions and the dealer manager fee and payments to the Advisor for reimbursement of issuer costs. During the acquisition and operational stages, these include payments for certain services related to acquisitions, financing and management of our investments and operations provided to us by the Advisor and Hines and its affiliates pursuant to various agreements we have entered into or anticipate entering into with these entities. We have also entered into several affiliated transactions with affiliates of Hines to make investments and provide financing. In addition to the description of the Aviva Coral Gables JV partnership agreement below, see Note 7 - Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning our Related-Party Transactions and Agreements.\nIn July 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a limited partnership agreement with an affiliate of Hines for the formation of Hines Ponce & Bird Holdings LP, a Delaware limited liability company, for the purpose of developing a residential/living project in Miami, Florida. Hines served as the initial general partner and as the development partner and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership was the initial limited partner in the partnership, which we refer to as the Aviva Coral Gables JV. Hines owned a 17% interest in the joint venture and the Company owned the remaining 83% interest through its subsidiary. As compensation for providing development management services, Hines was paid a fee equal to 4% of the development project costs. In addition, subject to certain return thresholds being achieved, the Aviva Coral Gables JV agreement provided that Hines may receive certain incentive distributions in the event the residential/living project is liquidated. The project was completed in April 2015. Hines received total distributions of $21.0 million from the Aviva Coral Gables JV in June 2017, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the return thresholds set forth in the Aviva Coral Gables JV agreement having been achieved. These distributions represented 37.3% of the total distributions made by the Aviva Coral Gables JV from the sale of the property.\nThe WaterWall Place JV agreement provided that, subject to certain return thresholds being achieved, an affiliate of Hines would receive certain incentive distributions. An affiliate of Hines received total distributions of $11.6 million from the WaterWall JV in September 2018, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the return thresholds set forth in the WaterWall agreement having been achieved. These distributions represented 27% of the total distributions from the WaterWall JV from the sale of the property.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table lists our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.

It has already disrupted global travel and supply chains, adversely impacted global commercial activity, and its long-term economic impact remains uncertain. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the Coronavirus and its potential effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken on a national and local level by government authorities and businesses. The travel restrictions, limits on hours of operations and/or closures of non-essential businesses and other efforts to curb the spread of the Coronavirus have significantly disrupted business activity globally, including in the markets where our remaining assets are located, and we expect them to have an adverse impact on the performance of our investments. Many of our tenants are subject to shelter in place and other quarantine restrictions, and the restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time. These restrictions are particularly adversely impacting many of our retail tenants (other than grocery tenants), as government instructions regarding social distancing and mandated closures have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated customer foot traffic, causing many of our retail tenants to temporarily close their brick and mortar stores. As of December 31, 2019, we owned four retail properties in the U.S., which comprised a significant portion of our portfolio. The outbreak is expected to have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. In addition, the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic makes it difficult to ascertain the long-term impact it will have on commercial real estate markets and our investments. Nevertheless, the Coronavirus presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the performance of our real estate investments, our financial results, and ability to complete the disposition of our remaining properties pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, such as the potential negative impact to occupancy at our properties, the potential closure of certain of our assets for an extended period, the potential for adverse impacts with respect to financing arrangements, increased costs of operations, decrease in values of our real estate investments, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy. We are unable to estimate the impact the Coronavirus will have on our financial results at this time.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

( Hines Global\u201d) was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Laws on December 10, 2008, primarily for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global raised the equity capital for its real estate investments through two public offerings from August 2009 through April 2014, and through its distribution reinvestment plan (the DRP Offering\u201d) from April 2014 through August 2018. Collectively, through its public offerings, Hines Global raised gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion, including the DRP Offering, all of which was invested in the Company's real estate portfolio.\nWe invested the proceeds from our public offerings into a diverse portfolio of real estate investments. In recent years, we have concentrated our efforts on actively managing our assets and exploring a variety of strategic opportunities focused on enhancing the composition of our portfolio and its total return potential for its stockholders. On April 23, 2018, in connection with its review of potential strategic alternatives available to the Company, our board of directors determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to sell all or substantially all of our properties and assets and for the Company to liquidate and dissolve pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. The principal purpose of the liquidation is to provide liquidity to our stockholders by selling the Company's assets, paying its debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. As required by Maryland law and our charter, the Plan of Liquidation was approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on July 17, 2018.\nIn April 2018, our board of directors estimated that, in addition to regular operating distributions paid to our stockholders, if we are able to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation, then after the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the payment of all of the our outstanding liabilities, we will have made total Return of Capital distributions to our stockholders of approximately $10.00 to $11.00 per share of the Company's common stock, consisting of three components: (i) the $1.05 per share special distribution paid to stockholders in January 2018; (ii) the $0.12 per share of return on invested capital distributions paid to stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2018; and (iii) the range of liquidating distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation of $8.83 to $9.83 per share, estimated by our board of directors in April 2018, and we have made liquidating distributions of approximately $2.83 per share to date.\nFrom January 2018 through February 2019, we paid Return of Capital Distributions to our stockholders totaling approximately $4.00, consisting of the $1.05 per share Special Distribution paid in January 2018, the $0.12 per share Return of Invested Capital Distributions paid for the six months ended June 30, 2018, $0.33 per share monthly liquidating distributions paid between August 2018 and January 2019, and the $2.50 per share liquidating distribution paid in February 2019. We have been working diligently to successfully execute the Plan of Liquidation. Our original goal was to complete the liquidation and make final distributions to our stockholders by July 17, 2020 (24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation). While we have been actively marketing the remaining assets for disposition, the recent spread of the COVID-19 (more commonly referred to as the Coronavirus) pandemic and its impact on the global economic environment has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on overall market conditions and our disposition process. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact to the process or timing, but we remain very thoughtful in proactively positioning our portfolio to be flexible and adaptable to the evolving circumstances. Accordingly, there can be no assurances regarding the timing or amounts of any further liquidating distributions, that we will ultimately pay aggregate liquidating distributions within the range estimated by our board of directors when it approved the Plan of Liquidation in April 2018, or that we will make the final distribution on or before July 17, 2020. If we are unable to complete the liquidation and make final distributions to our stockholders by July 17, 2020, we expect that any remaining assets and liabilities of the Company would be transferred into a liquidating trust as described in the Plan of Liquidation approved by our stockholders in July 2018. In addition, even if we sell\nall of our assets by July 17, 2020, we may determine not to distribute all distributable cash by that date and may establish a reserve to provide for any remaining obligations and to cover our expenses as we complete our wind down and dissolution.\nAt the peak of our acquisition phase, we owned interests in 45 properties. We sold interests in six properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.0 billion during 2017, 20 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.7 billion during 2018, four properties for an aggregate sales prices of $1.3 billion during 2019 and two additional properties through March 30, 2020 for an aggregate sales price of $379.9 million. Following these sales, we owned eight properties. Approximately 64% of our remaining portfolio is located throughout the United States and approximately 36% is located internationally. Additionally, our remaining portfolio is comprised of investments in approximately 41% office and 59% retail.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, application of our accounting policies involves exercising judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Property and Lease Intangibles\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected operating cash flows and expected proceeds from the eventual disposition of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, it would be written down to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. The determination of whether investment property is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of the evaluation.\nIn July 2019, we determined that all of our real estate properties and their related assets and associated liabilities should be classified as held for sale. As a result of the held for sale classification, amounts related to assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Also, as a result of the held for sale classification, we have stopped recording depreciation and amortization to the assets held for sale and their related liabilities as of July 2019.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded total impairment charges of $122.6 million, $19.2 million, and $7.1 million, respectively.\nDeferred Leasing Costs\nDirect leasing costs, primarily consisting of third-party leasing commissions and tenant inducements are capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease. Tenant inducement amortization is recorded as an offset to rental revenue and the amortization of other direct leasing costs is recorded in amortization expense. We consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes. These factors include: (i) whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; (ii) whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements; (iii) the uniqueness of the improvements; (iv) the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the term of the lease; and (v) who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements. The determination of who owns the tenant improvements for accounting purposes is subject to significant judgment. In making that determination, we consider all of the above factors. No one factor, however, necessarily establishes any determination. Further, as a result of the held for sale designation, no amortization was recorded after July 2019.\nRevenue Recognition and Valuation of Receivables\nWe are required to recognize minimum rent revenues on a straight-line basis over the terms of tenant leases, including rent holidays and bargain renewal options, if any. Revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant's lease provision. Leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations to the computation. We make quarterly accrual adjustments, positive or negative, to tenant reimbursement revenue to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term and are included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we will record a receivable for rent not yet due under the lease terms. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, to what extent the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables, at a portfolio level, are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, an allowance for the uncollectible portion of tenant and other receivables was determined and recognized based upon an analysis of the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically our most significant demands for funds were related to the purchase of real estate properties and other real estate-related investments. Specifically, we funded $5.1 billion of real estate investments using $3.1 billion of proceeds from our public offerings, including the DRP offerings, and debt proceeds. We invested all of the proceeds raised through our public offerings by the end of 2015. As a result, any real estate investments we made since that time were funded using proceeds from the dispositions of other real estate investments, debt proceeds, or our distribution reinvestment plan. Our significant demands for funds include the payment of operating expenses and debt service. Generally, we expect to meet these operating cash needs using cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the revolver, and cash on hand. However, as described further below, we intend to repay certain indebtedness that is coming due over the next year with proceeds from asset sales pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation, which will reduce the amount of cash available for liquidating distributions to our stockholders.\nAdditionally, as described previously, we have commenced the Plan of Liquidation in July 2018, and have been selling our properties and have distributed proceeds from the sale of our properties to our stockholders in the form of liquidating distributions at that time. We received proceeds from the sale of 28 properties from 2017 through February 2019, which were used to make Return of Capital distributions totaling $1.1 billion from January 2018 through February 2019 (approximately $4.00 per share). No additional distributions have been made since February 2019. Additionally, we sold four properties in late 2019 and early 2020 and used the proceeds to drastically reduce our leverage, as indicated below.\nBecause we had already sold a significant number of assets and our expectation is to sell the remaining assets in the time frame anticipated under the Plan of Liquidation, we stopped paying monthly distributions after December 2018. We intend to fund all future distributions with proceeds from the sale of our remaining properties and any future distributable income earned from the operating income or the sale of the remaining properties is expected to be included in the future liquidating distributions to the shareholders.\nWe believe that the proper use of leverage can enhance returns on real estate investments. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio was 23% leveraged, based on the values of our real estate investments. At that time, we had $537.8 million of principal outstanding under our various loan agreements with a weighted average interest rate of 3.0%, including the effects of related interest rate caps. Following the sales of two additional properties through March 30, 2020, our portfolio remained approximately 12% leveraged based on the values of our real estate investments. As of March 30, 2020, we have $234.3 million of debt scheduled to mature within a year. We intend to either refinance these loans, or repay these loans using proceeds from the sale of our real estate investments and available cash on hand.\nThe discussions below provide additional details regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Property-level operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages of property management personnel, utilities, cleaning, insurance, security and building maintenance costs, property management and leasing fees, and property taxes. Additionally, we pay general and administrative expenses, acquisition fees and expenses and asset management fees, which also reduce our operating cash flows.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.2 million compared to $2.5 million used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating cash flows have increased due to less deferred lease costs paid during 2019 compared to 2018, which was partially offset by decreases due to the dispositions of 20 properties in 2018 and four properties in 2019.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash from investing activities primarily relates to proceeds received from the sales of our real estate investments, capital expenditures at our properties, and activities related to our loans receivable. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $270.5 million compared to the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of property sales in each period:\n \u2022 We received proceeds of $1.1 billion from the sale of four properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 3 - Investment Property for additional information regarding the sale of the properties. \n \u2022 We paid $93.2 million in capital expenditures primarily at 25 Cabot Square and The Summit. \n \u2022 We received proceeds of $1.3 billion from the sale of 20 properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 We paid $76.6 million in capital expenditures at our operating properties, which includes re-development costs incurred at 25 Cabot Square and costs related to the development site at The Summit. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRedemptions\nAs described previously, we ceased offering primary shares pursuant to our second public offering in April 2014. In December 2018, the Board determined to suspend our share redemption program, effective February 2, 2019, except for redemption requests related to the death or disability of the stockholder. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we redeemed $30.3 million and $124.0 million in shares of our common stock through our share redemption program.\nDistributions\nAs described previously, we have declared distributions of approximately $0.65 per share (approximately $0.0541667 per share, per month) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $0.45 per share of these distributions were designated as a return of a portion of the stockholders' invested capital as further described below. Distributions were paid monthly on or around the first business day following the completion of each month to which they relate. All distributions were paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for those participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the suspension of our distribution reinvestment plan, all distributions paid after August 31, 2018 were paid to our stockholders in cash.\nFrom January 2018 through February 2019, we paid aggregate Return of Capital Distributions to stockholders totaling approximately $4.00 per share, which represent a portion of the stockholders' invested capital. These Return of Capital Distributions reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company and were made up of the following:\n \u2022 a $1.05 per share Special Distribution declared to all stockholders of record as of December 30, 2017 and paid in January 2018. The Special Distribution was funded with a portion of the net proceeds received from the strategic sale of six assets during 2017. \n \u2022 $0.12 per share resulting from a portion of the monthly distributions declared for the months of January 2018 through June 2018, (approximately $0.02 per share, per month), which were designated by our board of directors as a return of a portion of the stockholders' invested capital and, as such, reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company. \n \u2022 Approximately $0.33 per share resulting from the monthly liquidating distributions declared for the months of July 2018 through December 2018 (approximately $0.054167 per share, per month), which reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company. \n \u2022 a $2.50 per share liquidating distribution declared to all stockholders of record as of February 13, 2019 and paid in February 2019. \nExcluding the Special Distribution, distributions paid to stockholders (including those reinvested in stock) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $675.7 million and $177.1 million, respectively. We have paid no distributions since February 2019.\nAlso, in 2018, we declared distributions to a non-controlling interests holder totaling $11.6 million to an affiliate of Hines, as a result of the sale of WaterWall Place.\nThe table below contains additional information regarding distributions to our stockholders as well as the sources of distribution payments (all amounts are in thousands):\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Noncontrolling Interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions for the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Distributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distributions Reinvested\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Declared (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Declared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distributions funded from Cash Flows From Operating Activities (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$661,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>661,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$125,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes Return of Capital Distributions as described above. \n (2) In prior periods, our cash flows from operations were insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders. We funded the remaining distributions from proceeds from the sales of our real estate investments in the then-current and prior periods, and/or cash flows from financing activities. Starting from July 2018, all distributions have been Return of Capital Distributions. \n (3) Includes $11.6 million related to distributions declared to noncontrolling interests for a distribution to an affiliate of Hines, who was the Company's joint venture partner in the WaterWall joint venture, as a result of the sale of WaterWall Place in September 2018. \nDebt Financings\nWe utilize permanent mortgage financing to leverage returns on our real estate investments and use borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to provide funding for near-term investment or working capital needs. As mentioned previously, our portfolio was 23% leveraged as of December 31, 2019 (based on the values of our real estate investments as of December 31, 2018) with a weighted average interest of 3.0%.\nBelow is additional information regarding our loan activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 4 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our outstanding debt:\n \u2022 We borrowed approximately $324.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and made payments of $399.0 million. \n \u2022 We made a payment of $65.5 million to pay in full the mortgage loan for Minneapolis Retail Center in August 2019. \n \u2022 We made payments of $2.0 million related to deferred financing costs due to the refinancing for the Revolving Credit Facility in March 2019. \n \u2022 We borrowed approximately $343.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and made payments of $637.0 million. \n \u2022 We made payments totaling $353.6 million to repay mortgage loans that had been secured by properties sold during the year. \n \u2022 We also made payments of $198.3 million to repay the mortgage loans for 100 Brookes and The Summit and we made payments we made payments totaling $6.7 million on our remaining outstanding mortgage loans. \nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below includes information regarding changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, including explanations for significant changes and any significant or unusual activity.

expenses, real property taxes, and property management fees: These amounts related directly to the operations of our real estate investments. The decrease in these amounts is primarily due to the disposition of real estate investments during 2019. We disposed of four real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 20 real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2018. Please refer to our Same-store Analysis below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization: The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the disposition of real estate investments during 2018 and 2019, as described above.\nAsset management fees: We pay monthly asset management fees to the Advisor based on an annual fee of 1.5% of the net equity capital invested in real estate, which may be affected by the timing of the property sales, amounts of equity invested in properties that are sold, capital expenditures and changes in the leverage of our properties. Asset management fees decreased during 2019 as a result of the 24 property dispositions in 2018 and 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses include legal and accounting fees, printing and mailing costs, insurance costs, costs and expenses associated with our board of directors and other administrative expenses. The\ndecrease is due to the sale of 24 properties during 2018 and 2019 and the increased costs incurred in 2018 related to our plan of liquidation.\nImpairment losses: For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $115.4 million on six of our properties (in connection with designating our remaining properties as held for sale). The amount of the impairment charges represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the estimated net realizable value for each of these six properties. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, prior to the designating our properties as held for sale, we determined that one of our investment properties was impaired based on deteriorating market conditions. As a result, an impairment loss of $7.2 million was recorded to write down the carrying values to fair value as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that three of our investment properties were impaired as a result of deteriorating market conditions. As a result, an impairment loss of $19.2 million was recorded to write down its carrying value to its fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments: The loss on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to timing differences for the foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into related to the sales of our properties. The gain on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the net gain from the foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into related to the sales of our properties in Australia, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom during the year.\nGain on sale of real estate: The gain on sale of real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was due to the sale of four properties during 2019 and 20 properties during 2018, respectively.\nForeign currency gains (losses): See below under Same-Store Analysis for a description of the changes related to foreign currency gains (losses).\nInterest expense: The decrease in the interest expense in the table above is primarily due to our lower total debt principal in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes: The change in provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is a result of changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to book / tax timing differences at our international subsidiaries.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes related to sale of real estate: The provision for income taxes related to sale of real estate is due to taxes recognized upon the sale of German Logistics Properties and the Australia Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no provision for income taxes related to sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame-store Analysis\nWe evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned for the full periods presented. The following table presents the property-level revenues in excess of expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, by reportable segment. Same-store properties for the year ended December 31, 2019 include 10 properties owned as of January 1, 2018 that were 87% leased as of December 31, 2019 compared to 83% leased as of December 31, 2018. In total, property revenues in excess of expenses of the same-store properties decreased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The same-store comparison includes the results of operations of Riverside Center and Perspective Defense, all of which were sold subsequent to December 31, 2019. Below is additional information regarding our same-store results and significant variances from the prior year. Most of our leases are net leases, which provide for the recovery of most operating expenses, property taxes and management fees at our properties. As a result, we believe it is beneficial to analyze our same-store results on a net basis, as shown below. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property revenues in excess of expenses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic office investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,037\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International office investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total same-store properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disposed properties (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property revenues in excess of expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75,642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Property revenues in excess of expenses include total revenues less property operating expenses, real property taxes and property management fees. \n (2) Includes the property revenues in excess of expenses for the properties that were sold in 2019 and 2018. \nDomestic other investments:\n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of Minneapolis Retail Center decreased $0.8 million, primarily due to decreased occupancy. Minneapolis Retail Center was 96% leased at December 31, 2019 compared to 98% at December 31, 2018. \n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of the Markets at Town Center decreased $3.7 million, primarily due to the write-off of below-market lease intangibles, related to an anchor tenant vacating the property in June 2018. \n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of The Rim decreased $0.8 million, primarily due to decreased occupancy. The Rim was 89% leased at December 31, 2019 compared to 91% leased at December 31, 2018. \nInternational office investments:\n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of 25 Cabot Square increased $6.9 million, primarily due to increased occupancy. Cabot was 99% leased at December 31, 2019, compared to 76% at December 31, 2018, due to leasing activity following the completion of portions of the redevelopment project at the property in 2019. \nForeign Currency Gains (Losses)\nOur international real estate investments use functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date while income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity until the properties are sold and the gains or losses are realized.\nBy contrast, gains and losses related to transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency are recorded in foreign currency gains (losses) on the consolidated statement of operations. An exception is made where an intercompany loan or advance is deemed to be of a long-term investment nature, in which instance foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these gains/losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring our borrowings denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies and the changes to the related exchange rates between the date of the borrowing and the end of each period. These gains or losses exclude $36.8 million and $58.3 million of losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which related to the sale of our properties and were included in the gain (loss) on sale of real estate investments\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management's view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that due to the limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. We adopted ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018. Prior to ASU 2017-01, real estate acquisitions were generally considered business combinations and the acquisition-related expenses and acquisition fees were treated as operating expenses under GAAP.\nIn addition to FFO, management uses Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), as defined by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives (the IPA\u201d), as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate our operating performance. The IPA has recommended the use of MFFO as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs to enhance the assessment of the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be useful as a measure of the long-term operating performance of our investments or as a comparative measure to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended and described herein. MFFO includes funds generated by the operations of our real estate investments and funds used in our corporate-level operations. MFFO is based on FFO, but includes certain additional adjustments which we believe are appropriate. Such items include reversing the effects of straight-line rent revenue recognition, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and certain other items as described below. Some of these adjustments are necessary to address changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO. These changes also have prompted a significant increase in the magnitude of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined. Such items include amortization of out-of-market lease intangible assets and liabilities and certain tenant incentives.\nOther adjustments included in MFFO are necessary to address issues that are common to publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations. While other start-up entities may also experience\nsignificant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs like us are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nThe purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, including acquisition fees and expenses, was a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to our stockholders. MFFO excludes any acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses. As described above, prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses were characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses were paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds were not available to distribute to our stockholders. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties were being acquired. Since MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses related to all of our acquisitions, MFFO would only be comparable to the operations of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.\nManagement uses MFFO to evaluate the financial performance of our investment portfolio, including the impact of potential future investments. In addition, management uses MFFO to evaluate and establish our distribution policy and the sustainability thereof. Further, we believe MFFO is one of several measures that may be useful to investors in evaluating the potential performance of our portfolio following the conclusion of the acquisition phase, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses incurred prior to January 1, 2018, as described herein.\nMFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nFFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and MFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of MFFO:\n \u2022 MFFO excluded acquisition fees paid to our Advisor and acquisition expenses for periods prior to January 1, 2018. Although these amounts reduced net income, we generally have funded such costs with proceeds from our public offerings and acquisition-related indebtedness (and, solely with respect to acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of the Brindleyplace Project in July 2010, equity capital contributions from our joint venture partner) and do not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance and determining MFFO. \n \u2022 We use interest rate swap contracts and interest rate caps as economic hedges against the variability of interest rates on variable rate loans. Although we expect to hold these instruments to maturity, if we were to settle these instruments currently, it would have an impact on our operating performance. Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP. MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n \u2022 We use foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates on certain international investments. These derivative instruments are typically short-term and are frequently settled at amounts that result in additional amounts paid or received. However, such gains (losses) are excluded from MFFO since they are not considered to be operational in nature. Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP. MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations or may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n \u2022 We utilize the definition of FFO as set forth by NAREIT and the definition of MFFO as set forth by the IPA. Our FFO and MFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs, if they use different approaches. \n \u2022 Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and MFFO. Accordingly, the predictive nature of MFFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results. \nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nThe following section presents our calculation of FFO and MFFO and provides additional information related to our operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. As we have recently completed the investment phase of our operations, FFO and MFFO are not useful in comparing operations for the three periods presented below.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td>

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO. In addition, no depreciation or amortization was recorded after July 2019, due to all of our properties being classified as held for sale. \n (2) Represents the gain on disposition of certain real estate investments. Although this gain is included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded it from FFO because we believe doing so appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. \n (3) Represents impairment charges recorded in accordance with GAAP. Although such impairment charges on operating real estate investments and our investments in unconsolidated entities are included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded them from FFO because we believe doing so more appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments and our investments in unconsolidated entities on a comparative basis. See Critical Accounting Policies - Investment Property and Lease Intangibles\u201d for additional information regarding our impairment charges. \n (4) Includes income attributable to noncontrolling interests and all adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interests' share of the adjustments to convert our net income (loss) to FFO and MFFO. \n (5) Represents components of net income (loss) related to the estimated changes in the values of our interest rate contract derivatives and foreign currency forwards. We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n (6) Represents components of net income (loss) primarily resulting from the remeasurement of loans denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n (7) Includes the following components of revenues and expenses that we do not consider in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO for the period from inception through December 31, 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): \nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from Inception (December 10, 2008) through December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent adjustment (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of lease incentives (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of out-of-market leases (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Represents the adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We have excluded these adjustments from our evaluation of our operating performance and in determining MFFO because we believe that the rent that is billable during the current period is a more relevant measure of our operating performance for such period. \n (b) Represents the amortization of lease incentives and out-of-market leases. \n (8) Represents acquisition expenses and acquisition fees paid to the Advisor that were expensed in our consolidated statements of operations. We funded such costs with proceeds from our offering, and therefore do not consider these expenses in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO. \nFrom inception through December 31, 2019, we declared operating distributions to our stockholders totaling $1.0 billion (which does not include $1.1 billion Return of Capital Distributions declared from December 2017 to February 2019), compared to total aggregate FFO of $846.7 million and cash flows from operating activities of $585.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared no operating distributions (excluding $661.2 million of liquidating distributions declared in February 2019) to our stockholders, compared to total aggregate FFO of $47.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we declared operating distributions to our stockholders totaling $56.0 million and $179.6 million, respectively, compared to total aggregate FFO of $72.1 million and $167.3 million, respectively. Our board of directors does not intend to declare additional operating distributions, and intends for all future distributions to be liquidating distributions. During our offering and investment stages, we incurred acquisition fees and expenses in connection with our real estate investments, which were recorded as reductions to net income and FFO. From inception through December 31, 2019, we incurred acquisition fees and expenses totaling $223.2 million.\nAs noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been insufficient to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions may continue to be paid from other sources, such as proceeds from the sale of real estate investments and/or cash flows from financing activities. We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these sources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with the Advisor, Dealer Manager and Hines or its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities during the various phases of our organization and operation. During the organization and offering stage, these included payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions and the dealer manager fee and payments to the Advisor for reimbursement of issuer costs. During the acquisition and operational stages, these include payments for certain services related to acquisitions, financing and management of our investments and operations provided to us by the Advisor and Hines and its affiliates pursuant to various agreements we have entered into or anticipate entering into with these entities. We have also entered into several affiliated transactions with affiliates of Hines to make investments and provide financing. In addition to the description of the Aviva Coral Gables JV partnership agreement below, see Note 7 - Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning our Related-Party Transactions and Agreements.\nIn July 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a limited partnership agreement with an affiliate of Hines for the formation of Hines Ponce & Bird Holdings LP, a Delaware limited liability company, for the purpose of developing a residential/living project in Miami, Florida. Hines served as the initial general partner and as the development partner and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership was the initial limited partner in the partnership, which we refer to as the Aviva Coral Gables JV. Hines owned a 17% interest in the joint venture and the Company owned the remaining 83% interest through its subsidiary. As compensation for providing development management services, Hines was paid a fee equal to 4% of the development project costs. In addition, subject to certain return thresholds being achieved, the Aviva Coral Gables JV agreement provided that Hines may receive certain incentive distributions in the event the residential/living project is liquidated. The project was completed in April 2015. Hines received total distributions of $21.0 million from the Aviva Coral Gables JV in June 2017, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the return thresholds set forth in the Aviva Coral Gables JV agreement having been achieved. These distributions represented 37.3% of the total distributions made by the Aviva Coral Gables JV from the sale of the property.\nThe WaterWall Place JV agreement provided that, subject to certain return thresholds being achieved, an affiliate of Hines would receive certain incentive distributions. An affiliate of Hines received total distributions of $11.6 million from the WaterWall JV in September 2018, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the return thresholds set forth in the WaterWall agreement having been achieved. These distributions represented 27% of the total distributions from the WaterWall JV from the sale of the property.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table lists our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. Specifically included are our obligations under long-term debt agreements (in thousands):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes $229.4 million, and $79.8 million, in interest and principal payments related to the Term Loan Commitment and the Perspective Defense secured mortgage loan, respectively. We paid the Revolving Credit Facility - Term Loan and the Perspective Defense secured mortgage loan in full subsequent to December 31, 2019. See Note 4 - Debt Financing to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. \n (2) Notes payable includes principal and interest payments under our mortgage loans. For the purpose of this table, we assumed that rates of our unhedged variable interest loans were equal to the rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 and remain constant for the remainder of the loan term. Further, for the purpose of this table, for mortgages denominated in a \nforeign currency, we assumed the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 remains constant for the remainder of the loan term.\nRecent Developments and Subsequent Events\nRiverside Center\nIn January 2020, we sold Riverside Center for a contract sales price of $235.0 million. We acquired the property in March 2013 for $197.1 million. The purchaser is not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nPerspective Defense\nIn February 2020, we sold Perspective Defense for a contract sales price of \u20ac129.8 million (approximately $144.9 million at a rate of $1.12 per EUR). We acquired the property in June 2013 for \u20ac126.5 million (approximately $165.8 million at a rate of $1.31 per EUR). The purchaser is not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nJP Morgan Chase Revolving Credit Facility\nIn March 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, which resulted in the following changes:\n \u2022 a decrease in total commitments to $200.0 million available under the revolving loan commitment; \n \u2022 extended the maturity date to September 4, 2020, subject to two additional six-month extensions at the Company's option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. \nThe Rim Outparcels\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019 thru March 27, 2020, we sold several outparcels at The Rim for a total aggregate contract sales price of $25.1 million. The purchasers are not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nCoronavirus Outbreak\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019, there was a global outbreak of COVID-19 (more commonly referred to as the Coronavirus), which continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. It has already disrupted global travel and supply chains, adversely impacted global commercial activity, and its long-term economic impact remains uncertain. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the Coronavirus and its potential effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken on a national and local level by government authorities and businesses. The travel restrictions, limits on hours of operations and/or closures of non-essential businesses and other efforts to curb the spread of the Coronavirus have significantly disrupted business activity globally, including in the markets where our remaining assets are located, and we expect them to have an adverse impact on the performance of our investments. Many of our tenants are subject to shelter in place and other quarantine restrictions, and the restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time. These restrictions are particularly adversely impacting many of our retail tenants (other than grocery tenants), as government instructions regarding social distancing and mandated closures have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated customer foot traffic, causing many of our retail tenants to temporarily close their brick and mortar stores. As of December 31, 2019, we owned four retail properties in the U.S., which comprised a significant portion of our portfolio. The outbreak is expected to have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. In addition, the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic makes it difficult to ascertain the long-term impact it will have on commercial real estate markets and our investments. Nevertheless, the Coronavirus presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the performance of our real estate investments, our financial results, and ability to complete the disposition of our remaining properties pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, such as the potential negative impact to occupancy at our properties, the potential closure of certain of our assets for an extended period, the potential for adverse impacts with respect to financing arrangements, increased costs of operations, decrease in values of our real estate investments, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy. We are unable to estimate the impact the Coronavirus will have on our financial results at this time.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nExecutive Summary\nHines Global REIT, Inc. ( Hines Global\u201d) was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Laws on December 10, 2008, primarily for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global raised the equity capital for its real estate investments through two public offerings from August 2009 through April 2014, and through its distribution reinvestment plan (the DRP Offering\u201d) from April 2014 through August 2018. Collectively, through its public offerings, Hines Global raised gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion, including the DRP Offering, all of which was invested in the Company's real estate portfolio.\nWe invested the proceeds from our public offerings into a diverse portfolio of real estate investments. In recent years, we have concentrated our efforts on actively managing our assets and exploring a variety of strategic opportunities focused on enhancing the composition of our portfolio and its total return potential for its stockholders. On April 23, 2018, in connection with its review of potential strategic alternatives available to the Company, our board of directors determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to sell all or substantially all of our properties and assets and for the Company to liquidate and dissolve pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. The principal purpose of the liquidation is to provide liquidity to our stockholders by selling the Company's assets, paying its debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. As required by Maryland law and our charter, the Plan of Liquidation was approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on July 17, 2018.\nIn April 2018, our board of directors estimated that, in addition to regular operating distributions paid to our stockholders, if we are able to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation, then after the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the payment of all of the our outstanding liabilities, we will have made total Return of Capital distributions to our stockholders of approximately $10.00 to $11.00 per share of the Company's common stock, consisting of three components: (i) the $1.05 per share special distribution paid to stockholders in January 2018; (ii) the $0.12 per share of return on invested capital distributions paid to stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2018; and (iii) the range of liquidating distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation of $8.83 to $9.83 per share, estimated by our board of directors in April 2018, and we have made liquidating distributions of approximately $2.83 per share to date.\nFrom January 2018 through February 2019, we paid Return of Capital Distributions to our stockholders totaling approximately $4.00, consisting of the $1.05 per share Special Distribution paid in January 2018, the $0.12 per share Return of Invested Capital Distributions paid for the six months ended June 30, 2018, $0.33 per share monthly liquidating distributions paid between August 2018 and January 2019, and the $2.50 per share liquidating distribution paid in February 2019. We have been working diligently to successfully execute the Plan of Liquidation. Our original goal was to complete the liquidation and make final distributions to our stockholders by July 17, 2020 (24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation). While we have been actively marketing the remaining assets for disposition, the recent spread of the COVID-19 (more commonly referred to as the Coronavirus) pandemic and its impact on the global economic environment has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on overall market conditions and our disposition process. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact to the process or timing, but we remain very thoughtful in proactively positioning our portfolio to be flexible and adaptable to the evolving circumstances. Accordingly, there can be no assurances regarding the timing or amounts of any further liquidating distributions, that we will ultimately pay aggregate liquidating distributions within the range estimated by our board of directors when it approved the Plan of Liquidation in April 2018, or that we will make the final distribution on or before July 17, 2020. If we are unable to complete the liquidation and make final distributions to our stockholders by July 17, 2020, we expect that any remaining assets and liabilities of the Company would be transferred into a liquidating trust as described in the Plan of Liquidation approved by our stockholders in July 2018. In addition, even if we sell\nall of our assets by July 17, 2020, we may determine not to distribute all distributable cash by that date and may establish a reserve to provide for any remaining obligations and to cover our expenses as we complete our wind down and dissolution.\nAt the peak of our acquisition phase, we owned interests in 45 properties. We sold interests in six properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.0 billion during 2017, 20 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.7 billion during 2018, four properties for an aggregate sales prices of $1.3 billion during 2019 and two additional properties through March 30, 2020 for an aggregate sales price of $379.9 million. Following these sales, we owned eight properties. Approximately 64% of our remaining portfolio is located throughout the United States and approximately 36% is located internationally. Additionally, our remaining portfolio is comprised of investments in approximately 41% office and 59% retail.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, application of our accounting policies involves exercising judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Property and Lease Intangibles\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected operating cash flows and expected proceeds from the eventual disposition of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, it would be written down to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. The determination of whether investment property is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of the evaluation.\nIn July 2019, we determined that all of our real estate properties and their related assets and associated liabilities should be classified as held for sale. As a result of the held for sale classification, amounts related to assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Also, as a result of the held for sale classification, we have stopped recording depreciation and amortization to the assets held for sale and their related liabilities as of July 2019.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded total impairment charges of $122.6 million, $19.2 million, and $7.1 million, respectively.\nDeferred Leasing Costs\nDirect leasing costs, primarily consisting of third-party leasing commissions and tenant inducements are capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease. Tenant inducement amortization is recorded as an offset to rental revenue and the amortization of other direct leasing costs is recorded in amortization expense. We consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes. These factors include: (i) whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; (ii) whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements; (iii) the uniqueness of the improvements; (iv) the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the term of the lease; and (v) who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements. The determination of who owns the tenant improvements for accounting purposes is subject to significant judgment. In making that determination, we consider all of the above factors. No one factor, however, necessarily establishes any determination. Further, as a result of the held for sale designation, no amortization was recorded after July 2019.\nRevenue Recognition and Valuation of Receivables\nWe are required to recognize minimum rent revenues on a straight-line basis over the terms of tenant leases, including rent holidays and bargain renewal options, if any. Revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant's lease provision. Leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations to the computation. We make quarterly accrual adjustments, positive or negative, to tenant reimbursement revenue to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term and are included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we will record a receivable for rent not yet due under the lease terms. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, to what extent the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables, at a portfolio level, are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, an allowance for the uncollectible portion of tenant and other receivables was determined and recognized based upon an analysis of the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically our most significant demands for funds were related to the purchase of real estate properties and other real estate-related investments. Specifically, we funded $5.1 billion of real estate investments using $3.1 billion of proceeds from our public offerings, including the DRP offerings, and debt proceeds. We invested all of the proceeds raised through our public offerings by the end of 2015. As a result, any real estate investments we made since that time were funded using proceeds from the dispositions of other real estate investments, debt proceeds, or our distribution reinvestment plan. Our significant demands for funds include the payment of operating expenses and debt service. Generally, we expect to meet these operating cash needs using cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the revolver, and cash on hand. However, as described further below, we intend to repay certain indebtedness that is coming due over the next year with proceeds from asset sales pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation, which will reduce the amount of cash available for liquidating distributions to our stockholders.\nAdditionally, as described previously, we have commenced the Plan of Liquidation in July 2018, and have been selling our properties and have distributed proceeds from the sale of our properties to our stockholders in the form of liquidating distributions at that time. We received proceeds from the sale of 28 properties from 2017 through February 2019, which were used to make Return of Capital distributions totaling $1.1 billion from January 2018 through February 2019 (approximately $4.00 per share). No additional distributions have been made since February 2019. Additionally, we sold four properties in late 2019 and early 2020 and used the proceeds to drastically reduce our leverage, as indicated below.\nBecause we had already sold a significant number of assets and our expectation is to sell the remaining assets in the time frame anticipated under the Plan of Liquidation, we stopped paying monthly distributions after December 2018. We intend to fund all future distributions with proceeds from the sale of our remaining properties and any future distributable income earned from the operating income or the sale of the remaining properties is expected to be included in the future liquidating distributions to the shareholders.\nWe believe that the proper use of leverage can enhance returns on real estate investments. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio was 23% leveraged, based on the values of our real estate investments. At that time, we had $537.8 million of principal outstanding under our various loan agreements with a weighted average interest rate of 3.0%, including the effects of related interest rate caps. Following the sales of two additional properties through March 30, 2020, our portfolio remained approximately 12% leveraged based on the values of our real estate investments. As of March 30, 2020, we have $234.3 million of debt scheduled to mature within a year. We intend to either refinance these loans, or repay these loans using proceeds from the sale of our real estate investments and available cash on hand.\nThe discussions below provide additional details regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Property-level operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages of property management personnel, utilities, cleaning, insurance, security and building maintenance costs, property management and leasing fees, and property taxes. Additionally, we pay general and administrative expenses, acquisition fees and expenses and asset management fees, which also reduce our operating cash flows.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.2 million compared to $2.5 million used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating cash flows have increased due to less deferred lease costs paid during 2019 compared to 2018, which was partially offset by decreases due to the dispositions of 20 properties in 2018 and four properties in 2019.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash from investing activities primarily relates to proceeds received from the sales of our real estate investments, capital expenditures at our properties, and activities related to our loans receivable. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $270.5 million compared to the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of property sales in each period:\n \u2022 We received proceeds of $1.1 billion from the sale of four properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 3 - Investment Property for additional information regarding the sale of the properties. \n \u2022 We paid $93.2 million in capital expenditures primarily at 25 Cabot Square and The Summit. \n \u2022 We received proceeds of $1.3 billion from the sale of 20 properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 We paid $76.6 million in capital expenditures at our operating properties, which includes re-development costs incurred at 25 Cabot Square and costs related to the development site at The Summit. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRedemptions\nAs described previously, we ceased offering primary shares pursuant to our second public offering in April 2014. In December 2018, the Board determined to suspend our share redemption program, effective February 2, 2019, except for redemption requests related to the death or disability of the stockholder. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we redeemed $30.3 million and $124.0 million in shares of our common stock through our share redemption program.\nDistributions\nAs described previously, we have declared distributions of approximately $0.65 per share (approximately $0.0541667 per share, per month) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $0.45 per share of these distributions were designated as a return of a portion of the stockholders' invested capital as further described below. Distributions were paid monthly on or around the first business day following the completion of each month to which they relate. All distributions were paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for those participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the suspension of our distribution reinvestment plan, all distributions paid after August 31, 2018 were paid to our stockholders in cash.\nFrom January 2018 through February 2019, we paid aggregate Return of Capital Distributions to stockholders totaling approximately $4.00 per share, which represent a portion of the stockholders' invested capital. These Return of Capital Distributions reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company and were made up of the following:\n \u2022 a $1.05 per share Special Distribution declared to all stockholders of record as of December 30, 2017 and paid in January 2018. The Special Distribution was funded with a portion of the net proceeds received from the strategic sale of six assets during 2017. \n \u2022 $0.12 per share resulting from a portion of the monthly distributions declared for the months of January 2018 through June 2018, (approximately $0.02 per share, per month), which were designated by our board of directors as a return of a portion of the stockholders' invested capital and, as such, reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company. \n \u2022 Approximately $0.33 per share resulting from the monthly liquidating distributions declared for the months of July 2018 through December 2018 (approximately $0.054167 per share, per month), which reduced the stockholders' remaining investment in the Company. \n \u2022 a $2.50 per share liquidating distribution declared to all stockholders of record as of February 13, 2019 and paid in February 2019. \nExcluding the Special Distribution, distributions paid to stockholders (including those reinvested in stock) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $675.7 million and $177.1 million, respectively. We have paid no distributions since February 2019.\nAlso, in 2018, we declared distributions to a non-controlling interests holder totaling $11.6 million to an affiliate of Hines, as a result of the sale of WaterWall Place.\nThe table below contains additional information regarding distributions to our stockholders as well as the sources of distribution payments (all amounts are in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes Return of Capital Distributions as described above. \n (2) In prior periods, our cash flows from operations were insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders. We funded the remaining distributions from proceeds from the sales of our real estate investments in the then-current and prior periods, and/or cash flows from financing activities. Starting from July 2018, all distributions have been Return of Capital Distributions. \n (3) Includes $11.6 million related to distributions declared to noncontrolling interests for a distribution to an affiliate of Hines, who was the Company's joint venture partner in the WaterWall joint venture, as a result of the sale of WaterWall Place in September 2018. \nDebt Financings\nWe utilize permanent mortgage financing to leverage returns on our real estate investments and use borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to provide funding for near-term investment or working capital needs. As mentioned previously, our portfolio was 23% leveraged as of December 31, 2019 (based on the values of our real estate investments as of December 31, 2018) with a weighted average interest of 3.0%.\nBelow is additional information regarding our loan activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 4 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our outstanding debt:\n \u2022 We borrowed approximately $324.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and made payments of $399.0 million. \n \u2022 We made a payment of $65.5 million to pay in full the mortgage loan for Minneapolis Retail Center in August 2019. \n \u2022 We made payments of $2.0 million related to deferred financing costs due to the refinancing for the Revolving Credit Facility in March 2019. \n \u2022 We borrowed approximately $343.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and made payments of $637.0 million. \n \u2022 We made payments totaling $353.6 million to repay mortgage loans that had been secured by properties sold during the year. \n \u2022 We also made payments of $198.3 million to repay the mortgage loans for 100 Brookes and The Summit and we made payments we made payments totaling $6.7 million on our remaining outstanding mortgage loans. \nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below includes information regarding changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, including explanations for significant changes and any significant or unusual activity. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages:\n\n* Not a meaningful percentage\nTotal revenues, property operating expenses, real property taxes, and property management fees: These amounts related directly to the operations of our real estate investments. The decrease in these amounts is primarily due to the disposition of real estate investments during 2019. We disposed of four real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 20 real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2018. Please refer to our Same-store Analysis below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization: The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the disposition of real estate investments during 2018 and 2019, as described above.\nAsset management fees: We pay monthly asset management fees to the Advisor based on an annual fee of 1.5% of the net equity capital invested in real estate, which may be affected by the timing of the property sales, amounts of equity invested in properties that are sold, capital expenditures and changes in the leverage of our properties. Asset management fees decreased during 2019 as a result of the 24 property dispositions in 2018 and 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses include legal and accounting fees, printing and mailing costs, insurance costs, costs and expenses associated with our board of directors and other administrative expenses. The\ndecrease is due to the sale of 24 properties during 2018 and 2019 and the increased costs incurred in 2018 related to our plan of liquidation.\nImpairment losses: For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $115.4 million on six of our properties (in connection with designating our remaining properties as held for sale). The amount of the impairment charges represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the estimated net realizable value for each of these six properties. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, prior to the designating our properties as held for sale, we determined that one of our investment properties was impaired based on deteriorating market conditions. As a result, an impairment loss of $7.2 million was recorded to write down the carrying values to fair value as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that three of our investment properties were impaired as a result of deteriorating market conditions. As a result, an impairment loss of $19.2 million was recorded to write down its carrying value to its fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments: The loss on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to timing differences for the foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into related to the sales of our properties. The gain on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the net gain from the foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into related to the sales of our properties in Australia, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom during the year.\nGain on sale of real estate: The gain on sale of real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was due to the sale of four properties during 2019 and 20 properties during 2018, respectively.\nForeign currency gains (losses): See below under Same-Store Analysis for a description of the changes related to foreign currency gains (losses).\nInterest expense: The decrease in the interest expense in the table above is primarily due to our lower total debt principal in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes: The change in provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is a result of changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to book / tax timing differences at our international subsidiaries.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes related to sale of real estate: The provision for income taxes related to sale of real estate is due to taxes recognized upon the sale of German Logistics Properties and the Australia Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no provision for income taxes related to sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame-store Analysis\nWe evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned for the full periods presented. The following table presents the property-level revenues in excess of expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, by reportable segment. Same-store properties for the year ended December 31, 2019 include 10 properties owned as of January 1, 2018 that were 87% leased as of December 31, 2019 compared to 83% leased as of December 31, 2018. In total, property revenues in excess of expenses of the same-store properties decreased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The same-store comparison includes the results of operations of Riverside Center and Perspective Defense, all of which were sold subsequent to December 31, 2019. Below is additional information regarding our same-store results and significant variances from the prior year. Most of our leases are net leases, which provide for the recovery of most operating expenses, property taxes and management fees at our properties. As a result, we believe it is beneficial to analyze our same-store results on a net basis, as shown below. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages:\n\n (1) Property revenues in excess of expenses include total revenues less property operating expenses, real property taxes and property management fees. \n (2) Includes the property revenues in excess of expenses for the properties that were sold in 2019 and 2018. \nDomestic other investments:\n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of Minneapolis Retail Center decreased $0.8 million, primarily due to decreased occupancy. Minneapolis Retail Center was 96% leased at December 31, 2019 compared to 98% at December 31, 2018. \n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of the Markets at Town Center decreased $3.7 million, primarily due to the write-off of below-market lease intangibles, related to an anchor tenant vacating the property in June 2018. \n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of The Rim decreased $0.8 million, primarily due to decreased occupancy. The Rim was 89% leased at December 31, 2019 compared to 91% leased at December 31, 2018. \nInternational office investments:\n \u25e6 Revenues in excess of expenses of 25 Cabot Square increased $6.9 million, primarily due to increased occupancy. Cabot was 99% leased at December 31, 2019, compared to 76% at December 31, 2018, due to leasing activity following the completion of portions of the redevelopment project at the property in 2019. \nForeign Currency Gains (Losses)\nOur international real estate investments use functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date while income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity until the properties are sold and the gains or losses are realized.\nBy contrast, gains and losses related to transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency are recorded in foreign currency gains (losses) on the consolidated statement of operations. An exception is made where an intercompany loan or advance is deemed to be of a long-term investment nature, in which instance foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these gains/losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring our borrowings denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies and the changes to the related exchange rates between the date of the borrowing and the end of each period. These gains or losses exclude $36.8 million and $58.3 million of losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which related to the sale of our properties and were included in the gain (loss) on sale of real estate investments\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management's view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that due to the limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. We adopted ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018. Prior to ASU 2017-01, real estate acquisitions were generally considered business combinations and the acquisition-related expenses and acquisition fees were treated as operating expenses under GAAP.\nIn addition to FFO, management uses Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), as defined by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives (the IPA\u201d), as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate our operating performance. The IPA has recommended the use of MFFO as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs to enhance the assessment of the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be useful as a measure of the long-term operating performance of our investments or as a comparative measure to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended and described herein. MFFO includes funds generated by the operations of our real estate investments and funds used in our corporate-level operations. MFFO is based on FFO, but includes certain additional adjustments which we believe are appropriate. Such items include reversing the effects of straight-line rent revenue recognition, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and certain other items as described below. Some of these adjustments are necessary to address changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO. These changes also have prompted a significant increase in the magnitude of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined. Such items include amortization of out-of-market lease intangible assets and liabilities and certain tenant incentives.\nOther adjustments included in MFFO are necessary to address issues that are common to publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations. While other start-up entities may also experience\nsignificant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs like us are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nThe purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, including acquisition fees and expenses, was a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to our stockholders. MFFO excludes any acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses. As described above, prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses were characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses were paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds were not available to distribute to our stockholders. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties were being acquired. Since MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses related to all of our acquisitions, MFFO would only be comparable to the operations of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.\nManagement uses MFFO to evaluate the financial performance of our investment portfolio, including the impact of potential future investments. In addition, management uses MFFO to evaluate and establish our distribution policy and the sustainability thereof. Further, we believe MFFO is one of several measures that may be useful to investors in evaluating the potential performance of our portfolio following the conclusion of the acquisition phase, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses incurred prior to January 1, 2018, as described herein.\nMFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nFFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and MFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of MFFO:\n \u2022 MFFO excluded acquisition fees paid to our Advisor and acquisition expenses for periods prior to January 1, 2018. Although these amounts reduced net income, we generally have funded such costs with proceeds from our public offerings and acquisition-related indebtedness (and, solely with respect to acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of the Brindleyplace Project in July 2010, equity capital contributions from our joint venture partner) and do not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance and determining MFFO. \n \u2022 We use interest rate swap contracts and interest rate caps as economic hedges against the variability of interest rates on variable rate loans. Although we expect to hold these instruments to maturity, if we were to settle these instruments currently, it would have an impact on our operating performance. Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP. MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n \u2022 We use foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates on certain international investments. These derivative instruments are typically short-term and are frequently settled at amounts that result in additional amounts paid or received. However, such gains (losses) are excluded from MFFO since they are not considered to be operational in nature. Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP. MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations or may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n \u2022 We utilize the definition of FFO as set forth by NAREIT and the definition of MFFO as set forth by the IPA. Our FFO and MFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs, if they use different approaches. \n \u2022 Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and MFFO. Accordingly, the predictive nature of MFFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results. \nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nThe following section presents our calculation of FFO and MFFO and provides additional information related to our operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. As we have recently completed the investment phase of our operations, FFO and MFFO are not useful in comparing operations for the three periods presented below.\n\nNotes to the table:\n (1) Represents the depreciation and amortization of various real estate assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO. In addition, no depreciation or amortization was recorded after July 2019, due to all of our properties being classified as held for sale. \n (2) Represents the gain on disposition of certain real estate investments. Although this gain is included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded it from FFO because we believe doing so appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. \n (3) Represents impairment charges recorded in accordance with GAAP. Although such impairment charges on operating real estate investments and our investments in unconsolidated entities are included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded them from FFO because we believe doing so more appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments and our investments in unconsolidated entities on a comparative basis. See Critical Accounting Policies - Investment Property and Lease Intangibles\u201d for additional information regarding our impairment charges. \n (4) Includes income attributable to noncontrolling interests and all adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interests' share of the adjustments to convert our net income (loss) to FFO and MFFO. \n (5) Represents components of net income (loss) related to the estimated changes in the values of our interest rate contract derivatives and foreign currency forwards. We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n (6) Represents components of net income (loss) primarily resulting from the remeasurement of loans denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. \n (7) Includes the following components of revenues and expenses that we do not consider in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO for the period from inception through December 31, 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): \n\n (a) Represents the adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We have excluded these adjustments from our evaluation of our operating performance and in determining MFFO because we believe that the rent that is billable during the current period is a more relevant measure of our operating performance for such period. \n (b) Represents the amortization of lease incentives and out-of-market leases. \n (8) Represents acquisition expenses and acquisition fees paid to the Advisor that were expensed in our consolidated statements of operations. We funded such costs with proceeds from our offering, and therefore do not consider these expenses in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO. \nFrom inception through December 31, 2019, we declared operating distributions to our stockholders totaling $1.0 billion (which does not include $1.1 billion Return of Capital Distributions declared from December 2017 to February 2019), compared to total aggregate FFO of $846.7 million and cash flows from operating activities of $585.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared no operating distributions (excluding $661.2 million of liquidating distributions declared in February 2019) to our stockholders, compared to total aggregate FFO of $47.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we declared operating distributions to our stockholders totaling $56.0 million and $179.6 million, respectively, compared to total aggregate FFO of $72.1 million and $167.3 million, respectively. Our board of directors does not intend to declare additional operating distributions, and intends for all future distributions to be liquidating distributions. During our offering and investment stages, we incurred acquisition fees and expenses in connection with our real estate investments, which were recorded as reductions to net income and FFO. From inception through December 31, 2019, we incurred acquisition fees and expenses totaling $223.2 million.\nAs noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been insufficient to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions may continue to be paid from other sources, such as proceeds from the sale of real estate investments and/or cash flows from financing activities. We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these sources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with the Advisor, Dealer Manager and Hines or its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities during the various phases of our organization and operation. During the organization and offering stage, these included payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions and the dealer manager fee and payments to the Advisor for reimbursement of issuer costs. During the acquisition and operational stages, these include payments for certain services related to acquisitions, financing and management of our investments and operations provided to us by the Advisor and Hines and its affiliates pursuant to various agreements we have entered into or anticipate entering into with these entities. We have also entered into several affiliated transactions with affiliates of Hines to make investments and provide financing. In addition to the description of the Aviva Coral Gables JV partnership agreement below, see Note 7 - Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning our Related-Party Transactions and Agreements.\nIn July 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a limited partnership agreement with an affiliate of Hines for the formation of Hines Ponce & Bird Holdings LP, a Delaware limited liability company, for the purpose of developing a residential/living project in Miami, Florida. Hines served as the initial general partner and as the development partner and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership was the initial limited partner in the partnership, which we refer to as the Aviva Coral Gables JV. Hines owned a 17% interest in the joint venture and the Company owned the remaining 83% interest through its subsidiary. As compensation for providing development management services, Hines was paid a fee equal to 4% of the development project costs. In addition, subject to certain return thresholds being achieved, the Aviva Coral Gables JV agreement provided that Hines may receive certain incentive distributions in the event the residential/living project is liquidated. The project was completed in April 2015. Hines received total distributions of $21.0 million from the Aviva Coral Gables JV in June 2017, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the return thresholds set forth in the Aviva Coral Gables JV agreement having been achieved. These distributions represented 37.3% of the total distributions made by the Aviva Coral Gables JV from the sale of the property.\nThe WaterWall Place JV agreement provided that, subject to certain return thresholds being achieved, an affiliate of Hines would receive certain incentive distributions. An affiliate of Hines received total distributions of $11.6 million from the WaterWall JV in September 2018, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the return thresholds set forth in the WaterWall agreement having been achieved. These distributions represented 27% of the total distributions from the WaterWall JV from the sale of the property.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table lists our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. Specifically included are our obligations under long-term debt agreements (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes $229.4 million, and $79.8 million, in interest and principal payments related to the Term Loan Commitment and the Perspective Defense secured mortgage loan, respectively. We paid the Revolving Credit Facility - Term Loan and the Perspective Defense secured mortgage loan in full subsequent to December 31, 2019. See Note 4 - Debt Financing to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. \n (2) Notes payable includes principal and interest payments under our mortgage loans. For the purpose of this table, we assumed that rates of our unhedged variable interest loans were equal to the rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 and remain constant for the remainder of the loan term. Further, for the purpose of this table, for mortgages denominated in a \nforeign currency, we assumed the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 remains constant for the remainder of the loan term.\nRecent Developments and Subsequent Events\nRiverside Center\nIn January 2020, we sold Riverside Center for a contract sales price of $235.0 million. We acquired the property in March 2013 for $197.1 million. The purchaser is not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nPerspective Defense\nIn February 2020, we sold Perspective Defense for a contract sales price of \u20ac129.8 million (approximately $144.9 million at a rate of $1.12 per EUR). We acquired the property in June 2013 for \u20ac126.5 million (approximately $165.8 million at a rate of $1.31 per EUR). The purchaser is not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nJP Morgan Chase Revolving Credit Facility\nIn March 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, which resulted in the following changes:\n \u2022 a decrease in total commitments to $200.0 million available under the revolving loan commitment; \n \u2022 extended the maturity date to September 4, 2020, subject to two additional six-month extensions at the Company's option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. \nThe Rim Outparcels\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019 thru March 27, 2020, we sold several outparcels at The Rim for a total aggregate contract sales price of $25.1 million. The purchasers are not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nCoronavirus Outbreak\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019, there was a global outbreak of COVID-19 (more commonly referred to as the Coronavirus), which continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. It has already disrupted global travel and supply chains, adversely impacted global commercial activity, and its long-term economic impact remains uncertain. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the Coronavirus and its potential effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken on a national and local level by government authorities and businesses. The travel restrictions, limits on hours of operations and/or closures of non-essential businesses and other efforts to curb the spread of the Coronavirus have significantly disrupted business activity globally, including in the markets where our remaining assets are located, and we expect them to have an adverse impact on the performance of our investments. Many of our tenants are subject to shelter in place and other quarantine restrictions, and the restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time. These restrictions are particularly adversely impacting many of our retail tenants (other than grocery tenants), as government instructions regarding social distancing and mandated closures have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated customer foot traffic, causing many of our retail tenants to temporarily close their brick and mortar stores. As of December 31, 2019, we owned four retail properties in the U.S., which comprised a significant portion of our portfolio. The outbreak is expected to have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. In addition, the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic makes it difficult to ascertain the long-term impact it will have on commercial real estate markets and our investments. Nevertheless, the Coronavirus presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the performance of our real estate investments, our financial results, and ability to complete the disposition of our remaining properties pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, such as the potential negative impact to occupancy at our properties, the potential closure of certain of our assets for an extended period, the potential for adverse impacts with respect to financing arrangements, increased costs of operations, decrease in values of our real estate investments, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy. We are unable to estimate the impact the Coronavirus will have on our financial results at this time.", "item_7_tables": "Table 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

acquisition phase. It has sold most of its properties already with the goal of providing liquidity to shareholders through distributions.\n\n- Total revenues, expenses, and gains on property sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to fewer properties owned after selling 20 properties in 2018 and 4 properties in 2019.\n\n- The company declared $4 per share in distributions to shareholders from January 2018 through February 2019 as part of the liquidation plan. No distributions have been declared since February 2019.\n\n- The global outbreak of COVID-19 has created uncertainty and is expected to adversely impact the disposition of the company's remaining assets. It presents risks regarding occupancy, potential property closures, financing arrangements, increased costs, and decreased property values.\n\n- The company has 8 properties remaining in its portfolio, located primarily in the US and UK. The portfolio is comprised of office and retail properties.\n\n- Two additional property sales occurred in early 2020 for $235 million and $145 million. The company also amended its credit facility and sold some additional outparcels of a retail property.\n\nIn summary, Hines Global REIT is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of properties and distributing proceeds to shareholders, but the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty around completing this process as planned."}
