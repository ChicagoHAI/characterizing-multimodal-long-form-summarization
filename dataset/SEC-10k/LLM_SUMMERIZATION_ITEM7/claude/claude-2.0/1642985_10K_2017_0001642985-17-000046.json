MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nMVP REIT II, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is a Maryland corporation formed on May 4, 2015 and intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased all selling efforts for the initial public offering (the \"Offering\") of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at $25.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2016, the Company raised approximately $56.4 million in the Offering before payment of deferred offering costs of approximately $1.1 million, contribution from the Sponsor of approximately $1.1 million and cash distributions of approximately $274,000.\nThe Company has also registered $50 million in shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") under which common stock holders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock at $25.00 per share.\nThe Company was formed to focus primarily on investments in parking facilities, including parking lots, parking garages and other parking structures throughout the United States and Canada. No more than 10% of the proceeds of this offering will be used for investment in Canadian properties. To a lesser extent, the Company may also invest in properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company is the sole general partner of MVP REIT II Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the \"Operating Partnership\"). The Company plans to own substantially all of its assets and conduct its operations through the Operating Partnership. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, MVP REIT II Holdings, LLC, is the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The operating agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that enables the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability, and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership is not classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation.\nThe Company utilizes an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (\"UPREIT\") structure to enable us to acquire real property in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Company's Operating Partnership from owners who desire to defer taxable gain that would otherwise normally be recognized by them upon the disposition of their real property or transfer of their real property to us in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock or cash.\nAs part of the Company's initial capitalization, the Company sold 8,000 shares of common stock for $200,000 to MVP Capital Partners II, LLC (the \"Sponsor\"), the sponsor of the Company. The Sponsor is owned 60% by Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NADSAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017 (\"VRM II\"), and 40% by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NASDAQ-listed company (\"VRM I\"), both which are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company in which Michael Shustek owns a significant majority. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nThe Company's advisor is MVP Realty Advisors, LLC (the \"Advisor\"), a Nevada limited liability company, which is owned sixty percent (60%) by VRM II and forty percent (40%) by VRM I. The Advisor is responsible for managing the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on the Company's behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor (the \"Advisory Agreement\"). The Company has no paid employees. The Advisor also advises MVP REIT, Inc. (\"MVP REIT\"), a real estate investment trust registered with the SEC with substantially the same investment strategy as the Company in that MVP REIT also invests primarily in parking facilities.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $274,000 in cash, issued 18,311 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including proceeds from the Offering, the sale of assets, or borrowings. The Company has no limits on the amounts it may pay from such sources. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, MVP REIT acquired an ownership interest in the following properties:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td> MVP REIT II %\n</td> <td>

<td> (1)\n</td> <td> In November 2016, these properties were merged into one holding company called West 9th Street Properties II, LLC, for the purposes of debt financing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns an 80% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT II owns a 20% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027. In connection with this purchase the Company paid a broker commission totaling 2% of the purchase price.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Broadway, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Broadway\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 161 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $2.4 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking Co, (\"St. Louis Parking\"), a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where Broadway is responsible for property taxes above a $19,600 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $180,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with Broadway receiving 75% of gross receipts over $270,000.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Seventh & Cerre, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"7th & Cerre\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 174 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $3.3 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking, a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where 7th & Cerre is responsible for property taxes above a $14,885 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $225,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with 7th & Cerre receiving 75% of gross receipts over $345,000.\nSince a majority of the Company's property leases call for additional percentage rent, the Company monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher the Company's potential percentage rent. Below graph is showing the comparison of the Company's monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held a 51% or more interest in 12 properties (out of 17 total investments), with initial purchase prices totaling approximately $54.4 million, of which the Company's portion was $47.9 million. Of those 12 properties; 9 were owned 100% by us, and three properties had common ownership with MVP REIT. The Company held a less than 50% ownership in five properties, where MVP REIT owned the majority share, of which the Company's share of the purchase price was approximately $3.9 million. One of those properties owned by us and MVP REIT is currently listed for sale at $6.1 million. These properties were acquired with funds from the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities.\nThe Company operates as a REIT. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Company's advisory agreement, however, the Company's board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, the Company's advisor, authority to manage the Company's day-to-day business, in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., (\"VRM II\") owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc. (\"VRM I\"); both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners II, LLC (\" the \"Sponsor\"). The Sponsor is owned 60% by Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NASDAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq, to be effective on or about March 30, 2017 (\"VRM II\"), and 40% by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc., a Maryland corporation and OTC Market-listed company (\"VRM I\"), both which are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company in which Michael Shustek owns a significant majority. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nVRM I, an OTC Pink Sheet-listed company, and VRM II, a NASDAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against MVP REIT, VRM I and VRM II, all of whom are managed by affiliates of the Company's sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict with respect to VRM I and VRM II, is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. MVP REIT has substantially the same investment strategy as the Company, in that MVP REIT is also focused primarily on investments in parking facilities. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReview of the Company's Policies\nThe Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, have reviewed the policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that the Company will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in its portfolio; (2) the Company's executive officers, directors and affiliates of the advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments the Company seeks; and (3) borrowings should enable the Company to purchase assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for the Company's stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company has purchased the majority of the properties since May 2016 (the Company had no rental income during 2015) and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company seeks to deploy the Company's offering proceeds. The Company expects that income and expenses related to the Company's portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets.

General and administrative expenses were approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This mainly consisted of professional fees of approximately $635,000, director fees of approximately $197,000, insurance totaling $173,000 and other expenses. The Company expects most of these expenses will continue in similar amounts in future years. General and administrative expenses were $119,000 for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015. A portion of these general and administrative expenses were paid through the Sponsor and recorded as a contribution from the Sponsor.\nAcquisition expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, acquisition expense totaled $3.7 million, of which $1.2 million were incurred by related parties. See Note E - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. As the Company did not acquire any properties during 2015, the Company had no acquisition expense for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015. As the Company continues to grow and acquire more properties the Company expects acquisition expenses to grow as well.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a 100% ownership interest in one property that was listed as held for sale, with a carrying value of approximately $700,000. This property was acquired on November 22, 2016. This property is accounted for at the fair value based on an appraisal.\nSee Note P - Assets Held for Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperations and maintenance. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operation and maintenance expenses totaled approximately $657,000, and mainly consisted of asset management fees to MVP Realty Advisor, LLC (the \"Advisor\") for approximately $197,000, payroll on the San Jose Garage of approximately $139,000 and property taxes of approximately $30,000. Remaining costs are associated with the operation of the properties such as property tax and repairs & maintenance. As the Company did not acquire any properties during 2015, the Company had no operations and maintenance expense for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015.\nSee Note E - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information on the asset management fee.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense totaled approximately $154,000, related to the interest expense incurred by the Company's KeyBank line of credit for $56,000, amortized loan cost of approximately $37,000, interest expense on the two Cleveland lots (MVP Cleveland West 9th, LLC & 33740 Crown Colony, LLC) for approximately $46,000 and approximately $1,000 related to financing of the Company's Directors and Officers liability Insurance. Interest expense was $1,000 for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015, which was due to the financing of the Company's Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's loan to cost ratio was approximately 24% (line of credit $8.0 million and notes payable of $5.3 million divided by total parking assets of $54.4 million). The Company expects to continue to leverage the Company's parking assets and future parking assets to fund additional purchases. This will result in higher interest expense in the future.

Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's performance relative to the Company's competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve the Company's objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate the Company's interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate the Company's risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of the Company's operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event. The Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of the Company's on-going portfolio performance. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in\nreported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or the Company's future ability to pay the Company's dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of the Company's portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of the Company's performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of the Company's operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Straight-line rent. Most of the Company's leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to the Company's stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the Offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the Offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless the Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to the Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of the Company's portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect the Company's operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of the Company's operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to the Company. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of the Company's cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at the Company's properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as the Company's where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under the Company's current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful\nin assisting management and investors in assessing the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the Offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value (\"NAV\") is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nThe Company's calculation of FFO and MFFO, attributable to common shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, and for the period from May 4, 2015 (Inception) through December 31, 2015.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the period from May 4, 2015 (Inception) through December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to MVP REIT II, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,268,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 195,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,054,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,472,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO attributable to MVP REIT II, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (353,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 30, 2015.\nThe Company's principal demand for funds will be/and is for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on the Company's outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to the Company's stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of the Company's common stock, including those offered for sale through the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in the Company's portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nIn addition, the Company anticipates raising additional funds though private placements of its preferred stock as well as through additional debt financing. As of March 22, 2017, the Company had raised $2,679,000 in funds from the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and Warrants.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled approximately $3.6 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $59.4 million and consisted of investments in real estate of approximately $53.7 million, investment in equity method investee of approximately $1.1 million, investments in cost method investees of\napproximately $2.0 million, investment in cost method investees held for sale of approximately $0.8 million, security deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $4.6 million, investment in assets held for sale of $0.7 million, and investment in MVP REIT, Inc. of $3.0 million, which offset by proceeds from non-controlling interest of $6.6 million. These deposits were used to fund the Detroit Center Parking Garage in January 2017 and the two St. Louis lots in February 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $65.7 million and mainly consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $54.0 million. In addition, financing activity included proceeds from notes payable of approximately $6.5 million, proceeds from the Company's KeyBank line of credit of approximately $8.2 million and cash distributions of approximately $274,000. Net cash used in financing activities also included approximately $2.6 million distributed to non-controlling interest related to their portion of the loan proceeds.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015 was $207,000. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $2.5 million and consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $2.4 million, and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $0.1 million, which offset by payments on notes payable of approximately $45,000. Our Sponsor has paid approximately $1.1 million in our organizational and offering cost on our behalf, which have been accounted for as contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company did not acquire any assets or earn any income from operations.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, and MVP REIT, through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association ('KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBank Capital Markets (\"KeyBank Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which may be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5 2018, and may be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions are met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an annual interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate is calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility are interest only and are due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement are joint and several. The REITs have entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. The Advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds of cash flow generated by the Company's investments or out of proceeds from the sale of investments. The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve during the initial stages of the Offering; however, the Company may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. The Company's lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in the Company's prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nThe Company's management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting the Company's targeted portfolio, the U.S. parking facility industry, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of the Company's assets.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to the Company's advisor and the selling agent(s). During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to the Company's advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of the Company's assets and costs incurred by the Company's advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to the Company's advisor, see \"Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection with the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Company's advisor and the Company's board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to the Company's Advisor and its affiliates in connection with the Company's organization, the Company's initial public offering and the Company's operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the period from May 4, 2015 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2015.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Period from\nMay 4, 2015 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition Fees - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 197,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,426,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions and Stock Dividends\nThe Company intends to make regular cash and stock distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by the Company's board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, the Company's distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income each year.\nOn October 23, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors has approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.0625 per share and monthly stock dividends of $0.0025 per share, based on a purchase price of $25.00 per common share, commencing after the Company breaks escrow upon receiving subscriptions for the minimum offering amount of $2 million. The initial cash distribution and stock dividend were paid on February 10, 2016 to stockholders of record as of January 24, 2016. The initial cash distributions were paid from offering proceeds rather than funds from operations and therefore may represent a return of capital. There can be no assurance that distributions and dividends will continue to be paid at this rate. The Company's board of directors may at any time change the distribution and dividend rate or suspend payment of distributions and dividends if it determines that such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Company expects that its board of directors will continue to authorize, and it will declare, distributions based on a record date on the 24th of each month, and it expects to continue to pay distributions on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day), monthly in arrears. The Company has not established a minimum distribution level, and its charter does not require that it make distributions to its stockholders; however, the Company anticipates the payment of monthly distributions. The Company may also make special stock dividends.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $274,000 in cash, issued 18,311 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company's total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash\nflows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, all distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and therefore may represent a return of capital.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid in Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid through DRIP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\nDistributions Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Flows Used in Operations (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (134,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 114,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (435,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 85,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 136,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 221,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,181,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 132,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 241,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 373,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,894,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 732,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,644,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend distribution made to the Company's stockholders through the DRIP.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from equity offerings, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from the Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees\nor reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOn November 5, 2016, the Company purchased 338,409 shares of MVP REIT's common stock from an unrelated third party for $3.0 million or $8.865 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2106, the Company received, approximately $34,000 in distributions, related to the Company's ownership of MVP REIT common stock.\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has been organized and conducts its operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The Company expects to qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. The Company's REIT taxable income\nmay substantially exceed or be less than the net income as determined based on GAAP, because, differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nREIT Compliance\nThe Company intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, therefore generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that the Company distributes to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to the Company's stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the Company's REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on the taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nReal Estate Investments & Industry Outlook\nThe Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as \"held for sale\" on the balance sheet.\nFavorable U.S. Treasury yields and competitive lender spreads have created a generally favorable borrowing environment for real estate purchases in 2015 and 2016. Given the uncertainty around the world's financial markets, investors have been willing to accept lower yields on U.S. government backed securities, providing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae with excellent access to investor capital. During the 4th quarter of 2016, U.S. Treasury rates increased, the Company expects the market to continue to increase US Treasury rates over the next year, which will make it harder to finance the Company's current unencumbered properties or to finance new acquisitions at favorable rates. Management will continue to look for favorable financing opportunities that will maximize the Company's use of cash, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find favorable rates.\nParking Industry Outlook\nIn December 2016, the National Parking Association, (\"NPA\"), released their annual Parking Demand Report, which highlighted long-term demand and potential trends in the parking industry. According to the NPA's website http://weareparking.org some of the key finds include:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Parking revenue is projected to grow from just under $25 billion in 2015 to nearly $29 billion by 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The #1 reason for parking growth is population expansion projected to increase from 320M in 2015, to 400M by 2050.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> 15 year trend continues, 86 percent of U.S. commuters' say driving and parking their vehicle is their dominant mode of transportation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Approximately 119.9M Americans drive to work (2013 U.S. Census).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix highlight urbanization and density and have the most parking growth potential.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The top two states in terms of parking revenue are California ($1.4 billion), and New York ($1.2 billion).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> By region, population density leads to parking growth in the New York/Northeast corridor.

When looking at macroeconomic, demographic, employment, and industry statistics, NPA see a picture of patterns that influence parking demand in North America:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Population: Fundamental population growth of 9.6% from the 2000 U.S. Census to the 2010 U.S. Census is expected to continue into the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Employment: In the U.S., 92% employment provides sustained parking demand, 6.2% unemployment as of August 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Baby Boomers.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements.\nAdditionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of the Company's results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once the Company commences significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe Company are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on the Company's analysis of comparable properties in the Company's portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by the Company in its analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized. Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and the Company's overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by the Company in determining these values include the nature and extent of the Company's existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. The Company will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of the pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest\nmethod. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of the Company's gross contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,393,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,632,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital and Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principle\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,190,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,190,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,583,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,421,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,632,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual obligation table amount does not reflect the unamortized loan issuance costs of approximately $0.1 million for notes payable and approximately $0.2 million for the line of credit as of December 31, 2016.\nSubsequent Events\nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns a 80% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT owns an 20% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027. In connection with this purchase the company paid a broker commission totaling 2% of the purchase price.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Broadway, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Broadway\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 161 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $2.4 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking Co, (\"St. Louis Parking\"), a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where Broadway is responsible for property taxes above a $19,600 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $180,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with Broadway receiving 75% of gross receipts over $270,000.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Seventh & Cerre, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"7th & Cerre\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 174 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $3.3 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking, a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where 7th & Cerre is responsible for property taxes above a $14,885 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $225,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with 7th & Cerre receiving 75% of gross receipts over $345,000.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nMVP REIT II, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is a Maryland corporation formed on May 4, 2015 and intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased all selling efforts for the initial public offering (the \"Offering\") of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at $25.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2016, the Company raised approximately $56.4 million in the Offering before payment of deferred offering costs of approximately $1.1 million, contribution from the Sponsor of approximately $1.1 million and cash distributions of approximately $274,000.\nThe Company has also registered $50 million in shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") under which common stock holders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock at $25.00 per share.\nThe Company was formed to focus primarily on investments in parking facilities, including parking lots, parking garages and other parking structures throughout the United States and Canada. No more than 10% of the proceeds of this offering will be used for investment in Canadian properties. To a lesser extent, the Company may also invest in properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company is the sole general partner of MVP REIT II Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the \"Operating Partnership\"). The Company plans to own substantially all of its assets and conduct its operations through the Operating Partnership. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, MVP REIT II Holdings, LLC, is the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The operating agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that enables the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability, and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership is not classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation.\nThe Company utilizes an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (\"UPREIT\") structure to enable us to acquire real property in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Company's Operating Partnership from owners who desire to defer taxable gain that would otherwise normally be recognized by them upon the disposition of their real property or transfer of their real property to us in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock or cash.\nAs part of the Company's initial capitalization, the Company sold 8,000 shares of common stock for $200,000 to MVP Capital Partners II, LLC (the \"Sponsor\"), the sponsor of the Company. The Sponsor is owned 60% by Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NADSAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017 (\"VRM II\"), and 40% by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NASDAQ-listed company (\"VRM I\"), both which are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company in which Michael Shustek owns a significant majority. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nThe Company's advisor is MVP Realty Advisors, LLC (the \"Advisor\"), a Nevada limited liability company, which is owned sixty percent (60%) by VRM II and forty percent (40%) by VRM I. The Advisor is responsible for managing the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on the Company's behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor (the \"Advisory Agreement\"). The Company has no paid employees. The Advisor also advises MVP REIT, Inc. (\"MVP REIT\"), a real estate investment trust registered with the SEC with substantially the same investment strategy as the Company in that MVP REIT also invests primarily in parking facilities.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $274,000 in cash, issued 18,311 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including proceeds from the Offering, the sale of assets, or borrowings. The Company has no limits on the amounts it may pay from such sources. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, MVP REIT acquired an ownership interest in the following properties:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td> MVP REIT II %\n</td> <td>

these properties were merged into one holding company called West 9th Street Properties II, LLC, for the purposes of debt financing. \nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns an 80% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT II owns a 20% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027. In connection with this purchase the Company paid a broker commission totaling 2% of the purchase price.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Broadway, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Broadway\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 161 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $2.4 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking Co, (\"St. Louis Parking\"), a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where Broadway is responsible for property taxes above a $19,600 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $180,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with Broadway receiving 75% of gross receipts over $270,000.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Seventh & Cerre, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"7th & Cerre\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 174 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $3.3 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking, a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where 7th & Cerre is responsible for property taxes above a $14,885 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $225,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with 7th & Cerre receiving 75% of gross receipts over $345,000.\nSince a majority of the Company's property leases call for additional percentage rent, the Company monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher the Company's potential percentage rent. Below graph is showing the comparison of the Company's monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held a 51% or more interest in 12 properties (out of 17 total investments), with initial purchase prices totaling approximately $54.4 million, of which the Company's portion was $47.9 million. Of those 12 properties; 9 were owned 100% by us, and three properties had common ownership with MVP REIT. The Company held a less than 50% ownership in five properties, where MVP REIT owned the majority share, of which the Company's share of the purchase price was approximately $3.9 million. One of those properties owned by us and MVP REIT is currently listed for sale at $6.1 million. These properties were acquired with funds from the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities.\nThe Company operates as a REIT. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Company's advisory agreement, however, the Company's board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, the Company's advisor, authority to manage the Company's day-to-day business, in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., (\"VRM II\") owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc. (\"VRM I\"); both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners II, LLC (\" the \"Sponsor\"). The Sponsor is owned 60% by Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NASDAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq, to be effective on or about March 30, 2017 (\"VRM II\"), and 40% by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc., a Maryland corporation and OTC Market-listed company (\"VRM I\"), both which are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company in which Michael Shustek owns a significant majority. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nVRM I, an OTC Pink Sheet-listed company, and VRM II, a NASDAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against MVP REIT, VRM I and VRM II, all of whom are managed by affiliates of the Company's sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict with respect to VRM I and VRM II, is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. MVP REIT has substantially the same investment strategy as the Company, in that MVP REIT is also focused primarily on investments in parking facilities. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReview of the Company's Policies\nThe Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, have reviewed the policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that the Company will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in its portfolio; (2) the Company's executive officers, directors and affiliates of the advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments the Company seeks; and (3) borrowings should enable the Company to purchase assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for the Company's stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company has purchased the majority of the properties since May 2016 (the Company had no rental income during 2015) and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company seeks to deploy the Company's offering proceeds. The Company expects that income and expenses related to the Company's portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> Rental revenues (by property)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Cleveland West 9th, LLC (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 33740 Crown Colony, LLC (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 115,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP San Jose 88 Garage, LLC\n</td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 423,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MCI 1372 Street, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Cincinnati Race Street Garage, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 189,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP St. Louis Washington, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 72,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP St. Paul Holiday Garage, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 206,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> MVP Louisville Station Broadway, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 72,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> White Front Garage Partners, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 175,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cleveland Lincoln Garage Owners, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 93,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Houston San Jacinto Lot, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,602,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n a) As of December 31, 2016, the San Jose 88 Garage was under a Parking management agreement and the rental income represents the gross revenues generated by the property.

General and administrative expenses were approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This mainly consisted of professional fees of approximately $635,000, director fees of approximately $197,000, insurance totaling $173,000 and other expenses. The Company expects most of these expenses will continue in similar amounts in future years. General and administrative expenses were $119,000 for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015. A portion of these general and administrative expenses were paid through the Sponsor and recorded as a contribution from the Sponsor.\nAcquisition expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, acquisition expense totaled $3.7 million, of which $1.2 million were incurred by related parties. See Note E - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. As the Company did not acquire any properties during 2015, the Company had no acquisition expense for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015. As the Company continues to grow and acquire more properties the Company expects acquisition expenses to grow as well.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a 100% ownership interest in one property that was listed as held for sale, with a carrying value of approximately $700,000. This property was acquired on November 22, 2016. This property is accounted for at the fair value based on an appraisal.\nSee Note P - Assets Held for Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperations and maintenance. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operation and maintenance expenses totaled approximately $657,000, and mainly consisted of asset management fees to MVP Realty Advisor, LLC (the \"Advisor\") for approximately $197,000, payroll on the San Jose Garage of approximately $139,000 and property taxes of approximately $30,000. Remaining costs are associated with the operation of the properties such as property tax and repairs & maintenance. As the Company did not acquire any properties during 2015, the Company had no operations and maintenance expense for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015.\nSee Note E - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information on the asset management fee.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense totaled approximately $154,000, related to the interest expense incurred by the Company's KeyBank line of credit for $56,000, amortized loan cost of approximately $37,000, interest expense on the two Cleveland lots (MVP Cleveland West 9th, LLC & 33740 Crown Colony, LLC) for approximately $46,000 and approximately $1,000 related to financing of the Company's Directors and Officers liability Insurance. Interest expense was $1,000 for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015, which was due to the financing of the Company's Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's loan to cost ratio was approximately 24% (line of credit $8.0 million and notes payable of $5.3 million divided by total parking assets of $54.4 million). The Company expects to continue to leverage the Company's parking assets and future parking assets to fund additional purchases. This will result in higher interest expense in the future.

Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's performance relative to the Company's competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve the Company's objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate the Company's interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate the Company's risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of the Company's operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event. The Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of the Company's on-going portfolio performance. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in\nreported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or the Company's future ability to pay the Company's dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of the Company's portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of the Company's performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of the Company's operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\n \u00b7 Straight-line rent. Most of the Company's leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio. \n \u00b7 Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio. \n \u00b7 Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to the Company's stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the Offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the Offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless the Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to the Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of the Company's portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect the Company's operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of the Company's operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to the Company. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. \nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of the Company's cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at the Company's properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as the Company's where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under the Company's current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful\nin assisting management and investors in assessing the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the Offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value (\"NAV\") is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nThe Company's calculation of FFO and MFFO, attributable to common shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, and for the period from May 4, 2015 (Inception) through December 31, 2015.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the period from May 4, 2015 (Inception) through December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to MVP REIT II, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,268,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 195,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,054,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,472,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO attributable to MVP REIT II, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (353,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 30, 2015.\nThe Company's principal demand for funds will be/and is for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on the Company's outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to the Company's stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of the Company's common stock, including those offered for sale through the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in the Company's portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nIn addition, the Company anticipates raising additional funds though private placements of its preferred stock as well as through additional debt financing. As of March 22, 2017, the Company had raised $2,679,000 in funds from the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and Warrants.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled approximately $3.6 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $59.4 million and consisted of investments in real estate of approximately $53.7 million, investment in equity method investee of approximately $1.1 million, investments in cost method investees of\napproximately $2.0 million, investment in cost method investees held for sale of approximately $0.8 million, security deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $4.6 million, investment in assets held for sale of $0.7 million, and investment in MVP REIT, Inc. of $3.0 million, which offset by proceeds from non-controlling interest of $6.6 million. These deposits were used to fund the Detroit Center Parking Garage in January 2017 and the two St. Louis lots in February 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $65.7 million and mainly consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $54.0 million. In addition, financing activity included proceeds from notes payable of approximately $6.5 million, proceeds from the Company's KeyBank line of credit of approximately $8.2 million and cash distributions of approximately $274,000. Net cash used in financing activities also included approximately $2.6 million distributed to non-controlling interest related to their portion of the loan proceeds.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015 was $207,000. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $2.5 million and consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $2.4 million, and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $0.1 million, which offset by payments on notes payable of approximately $45,000. Our Sponsor has paid approximately $1.1 million in our organizational and offering cost on our behalf, which have been accounted for as contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company did not acquire any assets or earn any income from operations.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, and MVP REIT, through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association ('KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBank Capital Markets (\"KeyBank Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which may be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5 2018, and may be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions are met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an annual interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate is calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 1\u20442 of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility are interest only and are due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement are joint and several. The REITs have entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. The Advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds of cash flow generated by the Company's investments or out of proceeds from the sale of investments. The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve during the initial stages of the Offering; however, the Company may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. The Company's lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in the Company's prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nThe Company's management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting the Company's targeted portfolio, the U.S. parking facility industry, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of the Company's assets.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to the Company's advisor and the selling agent(s). During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to the Company's advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of the Company's assets and costs incurred by the Company's advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to the Company's advisor, see \"Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection with the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Company's advisor and the Company's board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to the Company's Advisor and its affiliates in connection with the Company's organization, the Company's initial public offering and the Company's operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the period from May 4, 2015 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2015.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Period from\nMay 4, 2015 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition Fees - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 197,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,426,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions and Stock Dividends\nThe Company intends to make regular cash and stock distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by the Company's board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, the Company's distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income each year.\nOn October 23, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors has approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.0625 per share and monthly stock dividends of $0.0025 per share, based on a purchase price of $25.00 per common share, commencing after the Company breaks escrow upon receiving subscriptions for the minimum offering amount of $2 million. The initial cash distribution and stock dividend were paid on February 10, 2016 to stockholders of record as of January 24, 2016. The initial cash distributions were paid from offering proceeds rather than funds from operations and therefore may represent a return of capital. There can be no assurance that distributions and dividends will continue to be paid at this rate. The Company's board of directors may at any time change the distribution and dividend rate or suspend payment of distributions and dividends if it determines that such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Company expects that its board of directors will continue to authorize, and it will declare, distributions based on a record date on the 24th of each month, and it expects to continue to pay distributions on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day), monthly in arrears. The Company has not established a minimum distribution level, and its charter does not require that it make distributions to its stockholders; however, the Company anticipates the payment of monthly distributions. The Company may also make special stock dividends.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $274,000 in cash, issued 18,311 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company's total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash\nflows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, all distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and therefore may represent a return of capital.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid in Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid through DRIP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\nDistributions Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Flows Used in Operations (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (134,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 114,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (435,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 85,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 136,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 221,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,181,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 132,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 241,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 373,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,894,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 732,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,644,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend distribution made to the Company's stockholders through the DRIP.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from equity offerings, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from the Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees\nor reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOn November 5, 2016, the Company purchased 338,409 shares of MVP REIT's common stock from an unrelated third party for $3.0 million or $8.865 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2106, the Company received, approximately $34,000 in distributions, related to the Company's ownership of MVP REIT common stock.\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has been organized and conducts its operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The Company expects to qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. The Company's REIT taxable income\nmay substantially exceed or be less than the net income as determined based on GAAP, because, differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nREIT Compliance\nThe Company intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, therefore generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that the Company distributes to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to the Company's stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the Company's REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on the taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nReal Estate Investments & Industry Outlook\nThe Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as \"held for sale\" on the balance sheet.\nFavorable U.S. Treasury yields and competitive lender spreads have created a generally favorable borrowing environment for real estate purchases in 2015 and 2016. Given the uncertainty around the world's financial markets, investors have been willing to accept lower yields on U.S. government backed securities, providing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae with excellent access to investor capital. During the 4th quarter of 2016, U.S. Treasury rates increased, the Company expects the market to continue to increase US Treasury rates over the next year, which will make it harder to finance the Company's current unencumbered properties or to finance new acquisitions at favorable rates. Management will continue to look for favorable financing opportunities that will maximize the Company's use of cash, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find favorable rates.\nParking Industry Outlook\nIn December 2016, the National Parking Association, (\"NPA\"), released their annual Parking Demand Report, which highlighted long-term demand and potential trends in the parking industry. According to the NPA's website http://weareparking.org some of the key finds include:\n \u00b7 Parking revenue is projected to grow from just under $25 billion in 2015 to nearly $29 billion by 2018. \n \u00b7 The #1 reason for parking growth is population expansion projected to increase from 320M in 2015, to 400M by 2050. \n \u00b7 15 year trend continues, 86 percent of U.S. commuters' say driving and parking their vehicle is their dominant mode of transportation. \n \u00b7 Approximately 119.9M Americans drive to work (2013 U.S. Census). \n \u00b7 New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix highlight urbanization and density and have the most parking growth potential. \n \u00b7 The top two states in terms of parking revenue are California ($1.4 billion), and New York ($1.2 billion). \n \u00b7 By region, population density leads to parking growth in the New York/Northeast corridor. The West Coast, anchored by California, continues to be a parking powerhouse. And Florida as 3rd most populous state, presents future revenue growth opportunities. \nAccording to NPA, parking demand is a function of a number of factors, all working in tandem to affect demand and usage. When looking at macroeconomic, demographic, employment, and industry statistics, NPA see a picture of patterns that influence parking demand in North America:\n \u00b7 Population: Fundamental population growth of 9.6% from the 2000 U.S. Census to the 2010 U.S. Census is expected to continue into the future. \n \u00b7 Employment: In the U.S., 92% employment provides sustained parking demand, 6.2% unemployment as of August 2014. \n \u00b7 Baby Boomers. The Baby Boomer population will be 65 or older in 2029 and stand at 61.3 million, representing 20% of the U.S. population. \n \u00b7 Colleges/Universities: College/university enrollment increased 30% from 2000-2009, from 15.3 million to 20.4 million. \n \u00b7 Municipalities: Public sector parking is beset by financial pressures; this pressure will accelerate automation and rate increases that will drive revenue. \n \u00b7 Pricing: Demand will be affected by demand pricing, mobile rate promotions, pre-paid parking and price increases, both public/private, as well as price rates for peak parking periods. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements.\nAdditionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of the Company's results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once the Company commences significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe Company are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on the Company's analysis of comparable properties in the Company's portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by the Company in its analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized. Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and the Company's overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by the Company in determining these values include the nature and extent of the Company's existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. The Company will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of the pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest\nmethod. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of the Company's gross contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,393,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,632,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital and Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principle\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,190,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,190,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,583,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,421,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,632,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual obligation table amount does not reflect the unamortized loan issuance costs of approximately $0.1 million for notes payable and approximately $0.2 million for the line of credit as of December 31, 2016.\nSubsequent Events\nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns a 80% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT owns an 20% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027. In connection with this purchase the company paid a broker commission totaling 2% of the purchase price.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Broadway, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Broadway\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 161 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $2.4 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking Co, (\"St. Louis Parking\"), a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where Broadway is responsible for property taxes above a $19,600 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $180,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with Broadway receiving 75% of gross receipts over $270,000.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Seventh & Cerre, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"7th & Cerre\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 174 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $3.3 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking, a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where 7th & Cerre is responsible for property taxes above a $14,885 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $225,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with 7th & Cerre receiving 75% of gross receipts over $345,000.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nMVP REIT II, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is a Maryland corporation formed on May 4, 2015 and intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased all selling efforts for the initial public offering (the \"Offering\") of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at $25.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2016, the Company raised approximately $56.4 million in the Offering before payment of deferred offering costs of approximately $1.1 million, contribution from the Sponsor of approximately $1.1 million and cash distributions of approximately $274,000.\nThe Company has also registered $50 million in shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") under which common stock holders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock at $25.00 per share.\nThe Company was formed to focus primarily on investments in parking facilities, including parking lots, parking garages and other parking structures throughout the United States and Canada. No more than 10% of the proceeds of this offering will be used for investment in Canadian properties. To a lesser extent, the Company may also invest in properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company is the sole general partner of MVP REIT II Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the \"Operating Partnership\"). The Company plans to own substantially all of its assets and conduct its operations through the Operating Partnership. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, MVP REIT II Holdings, LLC, is the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The operating agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that enables the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability, and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership is not classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation.\nThe Company utilizes an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (\"UPREIT\") structure to enable us to acquire real property in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Company's Operating Partnership from owners who desire to defer taxable gain that would otherwise normally be recognized by them upon the disposition of their real property or transfer of their real property to us in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock or cash.\nAs part of the Company's initial capitalization, the Company sold 8,000 shares of common stock for $200,000 to MVP Capital Partners II, LLC (the \"Sponsor\"), the sponsor of the Company. The Sponsor is owned 60% by Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NADSAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017 (\"VRM II\"), and 40% by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NASDAQ-listed company (\"VRM I\"), both which are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company in which Michael Shustek owns a significant majority. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nThe Company's advisor is MVP Realty Advisors, LLC (the \"Advisor\"), a Nevada limited liability company, which is owned sixty percent (60%) by VRM II and forty percent (40%) by VRM I. The Advisor is responsible for managing the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on the Company's behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor (the \"Advisory Agreement\"). The Company has no paid employees. The Advisor also advises MVP REIT, Inc. (\"MVP REIT\"), a real estate investment trust registered with the SEC with substantially the same investment strategy as the Company in that MVP REIT also invests primarily in parking facilities.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $274,000 in cash, issued 18,311 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including proceeds from the Offering, the sale of assets, or borrowings. The Company has no limits on the amounts it may pay from such sources. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, MVP REIT acquired an ownership interest in the following properties:\n\n\n (1) In November 2016, these properties were merged into one holding company called West 9th Street Properties II, LLC, for the purposes of debt financing. \nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns an 80% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT II owns a 20% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027. In connection with this purchase the Company paid a broker commission totaling 2% of the purchase price.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Broadway, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Broadway\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 161 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $2.4 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking Co, (\"St. Louis Parking\"), a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where Broadway is responsible for property taxes above a $19,600 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $180,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with Broadway receiving 75% of gross receipts over $270,000.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Seventh & Cerre, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"7th & Cerre\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 174 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $3.3 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking, a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where 7th & Cerre is responsible for property taxes above a $14,885 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $225,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with 7th & Cerre receiving 75% of gross receipts over $345,000.\nSince a majority of the Company's property leases call for additional percentage rent, the Company monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher the Company's potential percentage rent. Below graph is showing the comparison of the Company's monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held a 51% or more interest in 12 properties (out of 17 total investments), with initial purchase prices totaling approximately $54.4 million, of which the Company's portion was $47.9 million. Of those 12 properties; 9 were owned 100% by us, and three properties had common ownership with MVP REIT. The Company held a less than 50% ownership in five properties, where MVP REIT owned the majority share, of which the Company's share of the purchase price was approximately $3.9 million. One of those properties owned by us and MVP REIT is currently listed for sale at $6.1 million. These properties were acquired with funds from the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities.\nThe Company operates as a REIT. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Company's advisory agreement, however, the Company's board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, the Company's advisor, authority to manage the Company's day-to-day business, in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., (\"VRM II\") owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc. (\"VRM I\"); both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners II, LLC (\" the \"Sponsor\"). The Sponsor is owned 60% by Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., a Maryland corporation and NASDAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq, to be effective on or about March 30, 2017 (\"VRM II\"), and 40% by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc., a Maryland corporation and OTC Market-listed company (\"VRM I\"), both which are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company in which Michael Shustek owns a significant majority. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nVRM I, an OTC Pink Sheet-listed company, and VRM II, a NASDAQ-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against MVP REIT, VRM I and VRM II, all of whom are managed by affiliates of the Company's sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict with respect to VRM I and VRM II, is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. MVP REIT has substantially the same investment strategy as the Company, in that MVP REIT is also focused primarily on investments in parking facilities. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReview of the Company's Policies\nThe Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, have reviewed the policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that the Company will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in its portfolio; (2) the Company's executive officers, directors and affiliates of the advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments the Company seeks; and (3) borrowings should enable the Company to purchase assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for the Company's stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company has purchased the majority of the properties since May 2016 (the Company had no rental income during 2015) and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company seeks to deploy the Company's offering proceeds. The Company expects that income and expenses related to the Company's portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\n\n\n a) As of December 31, 2016, the San Jose 88 Garage was under a Parking management agreement and the rental income represents the gross revenues generated by the property. Operating expenses for this property are included in Operations and Maintenance. Starting on March 1, 2017, this property is expected to be leased to a national parking operator, with an annual base rent of $450,000 per year. \n b) In November 2016, these properties were merged into one holding company called West 9th Street Properties II, LLC, for the purposes of debt financing. \nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the period from May 4, 2015 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2015.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This mainly consisted of professional fees of approximately $635,000, director fees of approximately $197,000, insurance totaling $173,000 and other expenses. The Company expects most of these expenses will continue in similar amounts in future years. General and administrative expenses were $119,000 for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015. A portion of these general and administrative expenses were paid through the Sponsor and recorded as a contribution from the Sponsor.\nAcquisition expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, acquisition expense totaled $3.7 million, of which $1.2 million were incurred by related parties. See Note E - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. As the Company did not acquire any properties during 2015, the Company had no acquisition expense for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015. As the Company continues to grow and acquire more properties the Company expects acquisition expenses to grow as well.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a 100% ownership interest in one property that was listed as held for sale, with a carrying value of approximately $700,000. This property was acquired on November 22, 2016. This property is accounted for at the fair value based on an appraisal.\nSee Note P - Assets Held for Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperations and maintenance. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operation and maintenance expenses totaled approximately $657,000, and mainly consisted of asset management fees to MVP Realty Advisor, LLC (the \"Advisor\") for approximately $197,000, payroll on the San Jose Garage of approximately $139,000 and property taxes of approximately $30,000. Remaining costs are associated with the operation of the properties such as property tax and repairs & maintenance. As the Company did not acquire any properties during 2015, the Company had no operations and maintenance expense for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015.\nSee Note E - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information on the asset management fee.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense totaled approximately $154,000, related to the interest expense incurred by the Company's KeyBank line of credit for $56,000, amortized loan cost of approximately $37,000, interest expense on the two Cleveland lots (MVP Cleveland West 9th, LLC & 33740 Crown Colony, LLC) for approximately $46,000 and approximately $1,000 related to financing of the Company's Directors and Officers liability Insurance. Interest expense was $1,000 for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015, which was due to the financing of the Company's Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's loan to cost ratio was approximately 24% (line of credit $8.0 million and notes payable of $5.3 million divided by total parking assets of $54.4 million). The Company expects to continue to leverage the Company's parking assets and future parking assets to fund additional purchases. This will result in higher interest expense in the future. See Note N - Notes Payable and Note M - Line of Credit of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information\n\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's performance relative to the Company's competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve the Company's objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate the Company's interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate the Company's risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of the Company's operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event. The Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of the Company's on-going portfolio performance. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in\nreported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or the Company's future ability to pay the Company's dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of the Company's portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of the Company's performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of the Company's operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\n \u00b7 Straight-line rent. Most of the Company's leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio. \n \u00b7 Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio. \n \u00b7 Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to the Company's stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the Offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the Offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless the Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to the Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of the Company's portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect the Company's operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of the Company's operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to the Company. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. \nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of the Company's cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at the Company's properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as the Company's where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under the Company's current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful\nin assisting management and investors in assessing the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the Offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value (\"NAV\") is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nThe Company's calculation of FFO and MFFO, attributable to common shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, and for the period from May 4, 2015 (Inception) through December 31, 2015.\n\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 30, 2015.\nThe Company's principal demand for funds will be/and is for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on the Company's outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to the Company's stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of the Company's common stock, including those offered for sale through the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in the Company's portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nIn addition, the Company anticipates raising additional funds though private placements of its preferred stock as well as through additional debt financing. As of March 22, 2017, the Company had raised $2,679,000 in funds from the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and Warrants.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled approximately $3.6 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $59.4 million and consisted of investments in real estate of approximately $53.7 million, investment in equity method investee of approximately $1.1 million, investments in cost method investees of\napproximately $2.0 million, investment in cost method investees held for sale of approximately $0.8 million, security deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $4.6 million, investment in assets held for sale of $0.7 million, and investment in MVP REIT, Inc. of $3.0 million, which offset by proceeds from non-controlling interest of $6.6 million. These deposits were used to fund the Detroit Center Parking Garage in January 2017 and the two St. Louis lots in February 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $65.7 million and mainly consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $54.0 million. In addition, financing activity included proceeds from notes payable of approximately $6.5 million, proceeds from the Company's KeyBank line of credit of approximately $8.2 million and cash distributions of approximately $274,000. Net cash used in financing activities also included approximately $2.6 million distributed to non-controlling interest related to their portion of the loan proceeds.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the period from May 4, 2015 (date of inception) through December 31, 2015 was $207,000. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $2.5 million and consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $2.4 million, and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $0.1 million, which offset by payments on notes payable of approximately $45,000. Our Sponsor has paid approximately $1.1 million in our organizational and offering cost on our behalf, which have been accounted for as contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company did not acquire any assets or earn any income from operations.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, and MVP REIT, through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association ('KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBank Capital Markets (\"KeyBank Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which may be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5 2018, and may be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions are met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an annual interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate is calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 1\u20442 of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility are interest only and are due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement are joint and several. The REITs have entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. The Advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds of cash flow generated by the Company's investments or out of proceeds from the sale of investments. The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve during the initial stages of the Offering; however, the Company may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. The Company's lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in the Company's prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nThe Company's management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting the Company's targeted portfolio, the U.S. parking facility industry, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of the Company's assets.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to the Company's advisor and the selling agent(s). During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to the Company's advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of the Company's assets and costs incurred by the Company's advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to the Company's advisor, see \"Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection with the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Company's advisor and the Company's board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to the Company's Advisor and its affiliates in connection with the Company's organization, the Company's initial public offering and the Company's operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the period from May 4, 2015 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2015.\n\nDistributions and Stock Dividends\nThe Company intends to make regular cash and stock distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by the Company's board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, the Company's distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income each year.\nOn October 23, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors has approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.0625 per share and monthly stock dividends of $0.0025 per share, based on a purchase price of $25.00 per common share, commencing after the Company breaks escrow upon receiving subscriptions for the minimum offering amount of $2 million. The initial cash distribution and stock dividend were paid on February 10, 2016 to stockholders of record as of January 24, 2016. The initial cash distributions were paid from offering proceeds rather than funds from operations and therefore may represent a return of capital. There can be no assurance that distributions and dividends will continue to be paid at this rate. The Company's board of directors may at any time change the distribution and dividend rate or suspend payment of distributions and dividends if it determines that such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Company expects that its board of directors will continue to authorize, and it will declare, distributions based on a record date on the 24th of each month, and it expects to continue to pay distributions on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day), monthly in arrears. The Company has not established a minimum distribution level, and its charter does not require that it make distributions to its stockholders; however, the Company anticipates the payment of monthly distributions. The Company may also make special stock dividends.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $274,000 in cash, issued 18,311 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company's total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash\nflows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, all distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and therefore may represent a return of capital.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company issued 29,264 shares of its common stock as dividend distribution made to the Company's stockholders through the DRIP.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from equity offerings, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from the Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees\nor reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOn November 5, 2016, the Company purchased 338,409 shares of MVP REIT's common stock from an unrelated third party for $3.0 million or $8.865 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2106, the Company received, approximately $34,000 in distributions, related to the Company's ownership of MVP REIT common stock.\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has been organized and conducts its operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The Company expects to qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. The Company's REIT taxable income\nmay substantially exceed or be less than the net income as determined based on GAAP, because, differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nREIT Compliance\nThe Company intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, therefore generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that the Company distributes to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to the Company's stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the Company's REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on the taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nReal Estate Investments & Industry Outlook\nThe Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as \"held for sale\" on the balance sheet.\nFavorable U.S. Treasury yields and competitive lender spreads have created a generally favorable borrowing environment for real estate purchases in 2015 and 2016. Given the uncertainty around the world's financial markets, investors have been willing to accept lower yields on U.S. government backed securities, providing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae with excellent access to investor capital. During the 4th quarter of 2016, U.S. Treasury rates increased, the Company expects the market to continue to increase US Treasury rates over the next year, which will make it harder to finance the Company's current unencumbered properties or to finance new acquisitions at favorable rates. Management will continue to look for favorable financing opportunities that will maximize the Company's use of cash, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find favorable rates.\nParking Industry Outlook\nIn December 2016, the National Parking Association, (\"NPA\"), released their annual Parking Demand Report, which highlighted long-term demand and potential trends in the parking industry. According to the NPA's website http://weareparking.org some of the key finds include:\n \u00b7 Parking revenue is projected to grow from just under $25 billion in 2015 to nearly $29 billion by 2018. \n \u00b7 The #1 reason for parking growth is population expansion projected to increase from 320M in 2015, to 400M by 2050. \n \u00b7 15 year trend continues, 86 percent of U.S. commuters' say driving and parking their vehicle is their dominant mode of transportation. \n \u00b7 Approximately 119.9M Americans drive to work (2013 U.S. Census). \n \u00b7 New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix highlight urbanization and density and have the most parking growth potential. \n \u00b7 The top two states in terms of parking revenue are California ($1.4 billion), and New York ($1.2 billion). \n \u00b7 By region, population density leads to parking growth in the New York/Northeast corridor. The West Coast, anchored by California, continues to be a parking powerhouse. And Florida as 3rd most populous state, presents future revenue growth opportunities. \nAccording to NPA, parking demand is a function of a number of factors, all working in tandem to affect demand and usage. When looking at macroeconomic, demographic, employment, and industry statistics, NPA see a picture of patterns that influence parking demand in North America:\n \u00b7 Population: Fundamental population growth of 9.6% from the 2000 U.S. Census to the 2010 U.S. Census is expected to continue into the future. \n \u00b7 Employment: In the U.S., 92% employment provides sustained parking demand, 6.2% unemployment as of August 2014. \n \u00b7 Baby Boomers. The Baby Boomer population will be 65 or older in 2029 and stand at 61.3 million, representing 20% of the U.S. population. \n \u00b7 Colleges/Universities: College/university enrollment increased 30% from 2000-2009, from 15.3 million to 20.4 million. \n \u00b7 Municipalities: Public sector parking is beset by financial pressures; this pressure will accelerate automation and rate increases that will drive revenue. \n \u00b7 Pricing: Demand will be affected by demand pricing, mobile rate promotions, pre-paid parking and price increases, both public/private, as well as price rates for peak parking periods. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements.\nAdditionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of the Company's results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once the Company commences significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe Company are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on the Company's analysis of comparable properties in the Company's portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by the Company in its analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized. Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and the Company's overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by the Company in determining these values include the nature and extent of the Company's existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. The Company will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of the pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest\nmethod. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of the Company's gross contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\n\nContractual obligation table amount does not reflect the unamortized loan issuance costs of approximately $0.1 million for notes payable and approximately $0.2 million for the line of credit as of December 31, 2016.\nSubsequent Events\nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns a 80% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT owns an 20% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027. In connection with this purchase the company paid a broker commission totaling 2% of the purchase price.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Broadway, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Broadway\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 161 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $2.4 million in cash plus closing costs. The parking lot is under a 5 year lease with St. Louis Parking Co, (\"St. Louis Parking\"), a regional parking operator, under a modified net lease agreement where Broadway is responsible for property taxes above a $19,600 threshold, and St. Louis Parking pays for insurance and maintenance costs. St. Louis Parking pays annual rent of $180,000. In addition, the lease provides revenue participation with Broadway receiving 75% of gross receipts over $270,000.\nOn February 1, 2017, the Company, through MVP St. Louis Seventh & Cerre, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"7th & Cerre\"), an entity wholly owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 174 parking spaces, located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of $3.3 million in cash plus closing costs.
