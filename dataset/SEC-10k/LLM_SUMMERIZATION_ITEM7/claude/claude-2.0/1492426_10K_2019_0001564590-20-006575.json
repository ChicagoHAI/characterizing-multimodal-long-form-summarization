Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, business strategy and plans, financial condition, cash flows, performance, development plans and timelines, business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d will,\u201d and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, business strategy and plans, financial condition, cash flows, performance, business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances, or for any other reason.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d and Horizon\u201d refer to Horizon Therapeutics plc (formerly known as Horizon Pharma plc) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWhen accounting for business combinations under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, we previously separately identified and recorded at fair value intangible assets acquired and their related third-party contingent royalties at the date of acquisition. Third-party contingent royalties are royalties payable to parties other than sellers of the businesses. Effective January 1, 2019, we retrospectively changed our accounting for business combinations and we now record acquired intangible assets and their related third-party contingent royalties on a net basis, or the New Method. We changed our accounting principle on the basis that the use of the New Method is preferable primarily due to improved comparability with our peers. We adjusted the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2018, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to reflect this change in accounting. There was no impact on total operating, investing or financing cash flows for any period. In addition, there was no impact from the change in accounting principle on our previously reported adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for any prior period.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe are focused on researching, developing and commercializing medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare and rheumatic diseases. Our pipeline is purposeful: we apply scientific expertise and courage to bring clinically meaningful therapies to patients. We believe science and compassion must work together to transform lives.\nOn January 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved TEPEZZA\u2122 (teprotumumab-trbw), for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition.\nDuring 2019, our two reportable segments were (i) the orphan and rheumatology segment and (ii) the inflammation segment (previously the primary care segment). We report net sales and segment operating income for each segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS\u00ae to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA in the first quarter of 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our marketed medicine portfolio consisted of the following:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> Orphan and Rheumatology\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KRYSTEXXA\u00ae (pegloticase injection), for intravenous infusion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RAVICTI\u00ae (glycerol phenylbutyrate) oral liquid\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PROCYSBI\u00ae (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules, for oral use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ACTIMMUNE\u00ae (interferon gamma-1b) injection, for subcutaneous use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RAYOS (prednisone) delayed-release tablets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BUPHENYL\u00ae (sodium phenylbutyrate) tablets and powder\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> QUINSAIR\u2122 (levofloxacin) solution for inhalation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inflammation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PENNSAID\u00ae (diclofenac sodium topical solution) 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, for topical use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DUEXIS\u00ae (ibuprofen/famotidine) tablets, for oral use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIMOVO\u00ae (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium) delayed-release tablets, for oral use\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSince January 1, 2017, we completed the following acquisitions and divestitures:\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> On June 28, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT to Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for an upfront payment and potential additional contingent consideration payments, or the MIGERGOT transaction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura Group plc, or Vectura.

Our strategy is to maximize the benefit and value of our key growth drivers KRYSTEXXA and TEPEZZA, both rare disease medicines, and expand our pipeline for sustainable growth. We believe our strategy allows more patients to benefit from our on-market medicines, as well as from medicines we develop as part of our pipeline. Our vision is to build healthier communities, urgently and responsibly, which in turn, we believe, generates value to our many stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nOn May 2, 2019, our shareholders approved changing our name from Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company\u201d to Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company\u201d. We believe the new name better reflects our long-term strategy to develop and commercialize innovative new medicines to address rare diseases with very few effective treatment options.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nAs of December 31, 2019, our orphan and rheumatology segment consisted of our medicines KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, QUINSAIR and RAYOS. In January 2020, the FDA approved TEPEZZA for the treatment of TED. With the exception of RAYOS, all are orphan medicines for rare diseases.\nKRYSTEXXA is the only approved medicine indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, or gout that is refractory (unresponsive) to conventional therapies. We are focused on optimizing and maximizing the peak sales potential of KRYSTEXXA through our patient-centric commercialization efforts as well as investing in education, patient and physician outreach that demonstrates the benefits KRYSTEXXA offers in treating uncontrolled gout.\nThree areas are driving growth for KRYSTEXXA: an increase in new and existing accounts; accelerating uptake by nephrologists; and growth in the adoption of the use of KRYSTEXXA with the immunomodulator methotrexate to improve the KRYSTEXXA response rate in patients with uncontrolled gout.\nImmunomodulation is one of the clinical development programs we are investing in to evaluate ways to increase the number of patients who can benefit from KRYSTEXXA. Our registrational MIRROR randomized controlled trial, or RCT, is evaluating the co-administration of KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate, the immunomodulator most often used by rheumatologists, to increase the durability of response for uncontrolled gout patients. The MIRROR RCT, which we initiated in mid-2019, was preceded by the MIRROR open-label study, which was initiated in 2018 and completed in 2019. The recently announced positive topline results of the MIRROR open-label study signify to us the value of continuing our research into the benefits of this immunomodulation approach. We are also investing to expand the use of KRYSTEXXA among nephrologists by providing additional data about the effectiveness of KRYSTEXXA in treating uncontrolled gout with its kidney-friendly mechanism of action. In October 2019, we initiated our PROTECT open-label study to evaluate the use of KRYSTEXXA in adult uncontrolled gout patients who have undergone a kidney transplant, a population that was not originally studied in the KRYSTEXXA pivotal trials. We also plan to initiate a proof of concept study in 2020 to evaluate the impact of administering KRYSTEXXA over a shorter infusion time, which could improve the experience and convenience for patients. We believe KRYSTEXXA represents a significant driver of growth for Horizon.\nTEPEZZA is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition. TEPEZZA obtained FDA approval in early 2020, after an accelerated review of the medicine and its statistically significant Phase 3 data. Our commercialization strategy for the medicine, which we recently launched, has four components: (i) establishing the market structure and simplifying the diagnosis and treatment of TED for patients; (ii) educating the multiple stakeholders about TED, the benefits of TEPEZZA and the urgency to diagnose and treat; (iii) supporting the TEPEZZA launch with our comprehensive approach and including a high-touch, patient-centric model; and (iv) facilitating access to TEPEZZA and establishing a referral process for treating physicians who may not have infusion capabilities. During 2019, we invested significantly in TEPEZZA in preparation for its potential U.S. launch, driving awareness in the medical and patient community about TED and establishing a potential pathway for treatment.\nOur clinical strategy for TEPEZZA is to evaluate additional indications for the medicine. Scientific literature suggests that the mechanism of action of TEPEZZA, which is to block the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, could have an impact on fibrotic processes. As such, we expect to initiate an exploratory TEPEZZA study in the first half of 2020 in diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, a rare fibrotic disease with no treatment options. The objective of the exploratory trial is to evaluate objective biomarker and clinical endpoints to inform potential subsequent larger and longer duration clinical trials.\nOur strategy for RAVICTI, our medicine for the treatment of urea cycle disorders, is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of urea cycle disorders; to drive conversion to RAVICTI from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate based on the medicine's differentiated benefits; to position RAVICTI as the first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.\nOur strategy for PROCYSBI, our medicine for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis, is to drive conversion of patients from older-generation immediate-release capsules of cysteamine bitartrate; to increase the use of the medicine by diagnosed but untreated patients; to identify previously undiagnosed patients who are suitable for treatment; to position PROCYSBI as a first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.\nOur strategy with respect to ACTIMMUNE, our medicine for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease, includes increasing awareness and diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease and increasing compliance rates.\nWe also market the rheumatology medicine RAYOS. As of December 31, 2019, RAYOS was included in the orphan and rheumatology segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA in the first quarter of 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.\nInflammation\nAs of December 31, 2019, our inflammation segment consisted of our medicines PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and VIMOVO. Our strategy for our inflammation medicines is to educate physicians about these clinically differentiated medicines and the benefits they offer. Patients are able to fill prescriptions for these medicines through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient assistance program, as well as other pharmacies. We offer discount card and other programs to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. In addition, we have entered into business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our inflammation medicines. The business arrangements with the PBMs generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payers for qualifying prescriptions. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we moved our medicine RAYOS, which is not an orphan medicine, to the inflammation segment.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., or collectively Dr. Reddy's, who intends to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. The cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Dr. Reddy's advising that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of VIMOVO before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. On July 30, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied our request for a rehearing of the Court's invalidity ruling against the 6,926,907 and 8,557,285 patents for VIMOVO coordinated-release tablets. As a result, the District Court entered judgment in September 2019 invalidating the \u2018907 and \u2018285 patents, which ended any restriction against the FDA from granting final approval to Dr. Reddy's generic version of VIMOVO. On February 18, 2020, the FDA granted final approval for Dr. Reddy's generic version of VIMOVO. We anticipate that Dr. Reddy's will immediately launch its product at-risk notwithstanding the ongoing patent litigation. Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Ajanta Pharma LTD, or Ajanta, intending to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. If we are unsuccessful in any of the VIMOVO cases, we will likely face generic competition with respect to VIMOVO and sales of VIMOVO will be substantially harmed.\nWe market all of our medicines in the United States through our field sales forces, which numbered approximately 480 representatives as of December 31, 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended

The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net sales in our orphan and rheumatology segment of $98.1 million, offset by a decrease in net

Government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of gross sales are typically higher for medicines in the orphan and rheumatology segment compared to medicines in the inflammation segment.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patients' medical insurance deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual medical insurance deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased $29.1 million to $362.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $391.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 28% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a $17.0 million decrease in inventory step-up expense.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in inventory step-up expense of $17.0 million recorded to cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily related to KRYSTEXXA, inventory step-up being fully expensed by March 31, 2018, resulting in no significant inventory step-up expense being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $20.4 million to $103.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $82.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to total upfront and progress payments of $6.0 million incurred under our collaboration agreement with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC, or HemoShear, and a milestone payment of $3.0 million made to Roche relating to the TEPEZZA BLA submission to the FDA. In addition, employee-related costs increased by $6.5 million, TEPEZZA-related external costs increased by $3.3 million and KRYSTEXXA-related external costs increased by $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million to $697.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $692.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee costs of $17.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $14.0 million in legal fees and litigation settlements.\nLoss (Gain) on sale of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT for cash proceeds of $6.0 million, and we recorded a loss of $11.0 million on the sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan for cash proceeds of $35.0 million, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million on the sale. Additionally, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a potential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale. The contingent consideration payment of \u20ac3.0 million ($3.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at the date of receipt of 1.0991) was received in September 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due primarily to lower anticipated future net sales based on a Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, review. We also recorded an impairment of $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to LODOTRA as result of amendments to our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased $34.6 million to $87.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $121.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in debt interest expense of $27.9 million, primarily related to the decrease in the principal amount of our term loans, repayment of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, in May 2019 and in August 2019, repayment of our 8.750% Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Senior Notes, and an increase in interest income of $6.5 million.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $58.8 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the early redemption premiums and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the prepayment of $775.0 million of our 2023 Senior Notes and our 2024 Senior Notes, and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the $400.0 million of term loan repayments.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $593.2 million compared to $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The benefit for income taxes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $553.3 million deferred tax asset resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary.\nInformation by Segment\nSee Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of our segment operating income to our total loss before benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nThe following table reflects our orphan and rheumatology net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 929,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 831,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 306,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in orphan and rheumatology net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of $98.1 million as described above, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $69.4 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in costs to prepare for the U.S. launch of TEPEZZA.\nInflammation\nThe following table reflects our inflammation net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 370,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 376,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in inflammation net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income.

The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $18.6 million offset by a decrease in net sales of $5.7 million as described above. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to lower sample and patient assistance program administration expenses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended

Net sales decreased $3.3 million, or 62%, to $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to decreased shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occurred at the time we shipped, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales were not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and could therefore fluctuate significantly from period to period. Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.

This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patients' medical insurance deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual medical insurance deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2019, the 340B ceiling price rule became effective. With respect to KRYSTEXXA, the additional rebate\u201d scheme of the 340B pricing program, as applied to the historical pricing of KRYSTEXXA both before and after we acquired the medicine, have resulted in a 340B ceiling price of one penny. A material portion of KRYSTEXXA prescriptions (approximately 20 percent) are written by healthcare providers that are eligible for 340B drug pricing and therefore the reduction in 340B pricing to a penny has negatively impacted our net sales from KRYSTEXXA.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased $102.1 million to $391.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $493.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 47% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a $101.8 million decrease in inventory step-up expense.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in inventory step-up expense of $101.8 million recorded to cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily related to KRYSTEXXA, PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up expense. KRYSTEXXA inventory step-up expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $17.0 million compared to $78.3 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.3 million compared to $40.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $142.2 million to $82.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $225.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to $150.3 million related to the acquisition of River Vision during the year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, as amended by ASU No. 2017-01, we accounted for the River Vision acquisition as the purchase of an in-process research and development, or IPR&D, asset and, pursuant to ASC 730, Research and Development, or ASC 730, recorded the purchase as a research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement to license HZN-003, a rheumatology pipeline program with the objective of enhancing our leadership position in the uncontrolled gout market, from MedImmune LLC, or MedImmune, and we paid MedImmune an upfront cash payment of $12.0 million which we recorded as a research and development\u201d expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017 and included in accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2017. The upfront payment was subsequently paid in January 2018. Excluding the costs attributable to the acquisition of River Vision and HZN-003, research and development expenses increased by $20.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the costs associated with the development of TEPEZZA.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37.4 million to $692.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $655.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our KRYSTEXXA sales force that was initiated during the second half of 2017 and other activities to support the growth in sales of the medicine, and pre-launch costs for TEPEZZA.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due primarily to lower anticipated future net sales based on a Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, review. We also recorded an impairment of $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to LODOTRA as result of amendments to our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019. Impairment of long-lived assets of $22.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, represents the impairment of a non-current asset recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was previously included within selling, general and administrative\u201d expenses. On July 24, 2018, we completed the IMUKIN sale as further described in the next paragraph.\nGain on sale of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan for cash proceeds of $35.0 million, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million on the sale. Additionally, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a potential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased $4.8 million to $121.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $126.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $8.5 million primarily due to higher cash balances, partially offset by an increase of $3.7 million in interest expense.\nGain on divestiture. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the Chiesi divestiture for an upfront payment of $72.5 million, which reflects $3.1 million of cash divested, with additional potential milestone payments based on sales thresholds, and we recorded a gain of $8.0 million on the divestiture.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $44.8 million compared to $108.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The reduction in benefit for income taxes of $63.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax losses and the tax rate at which some of these reduced losses were tax effected resulting in a tax provision of $57.9 million and income tax expense of $45.8 million generated on an intra-company transfer of assets other than inventory during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of $84.0 million net benefit following the enactment in the United States of H.R. 1, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, in December 2017, which net benefit included a $143.3 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liability based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the write-off of the $59.2 million deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the date of enactment for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, we reflected the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete. To the extent that our accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act was incomplete but it was possible to determine a reasonable estimate, we recorded a provisional estimate in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017.\nOn April 2, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2018-28, or the Notice, which provided guidance for computing the business interest expense limitation under the Tax Act and clarified the treatment of interest disallowed and carried forward under Section 163(j) of the Code prior to enactment of the Tax Act. In accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118 and the guidance in the Notice we reinstated the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. The impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118 during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a $37.4 million increase to our benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. We had no other material measurement period adjustments under SAB 118.\nThe remainder of the decrease in benefit for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a tax provision of $8.1 million attributable to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to an increase in U.S. state effective tax rates attributable to the enactment of certain U.S. state legislation during the year ended December 31, 2018. These decreases to the benefit for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018 were partially offset by an income tax expense of $51.1 million on non-deductible research and development costs which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and did not re-occur for the year ended December 31, 2018, a tax benefit of $42.7 million U.S. federal tax and $7.9 million U.S. state tax benefit on the liquidation of a foreign partnership owned by us during the year ended December 31, 2018 and decreases to our current state income tax expense of $6.8 million resulting from current year pre-tax losses incurred in the U.S. group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the first of three tranches of our outstanding performance stock unit awards, or PSUs, issued in 2015 expired without payout as the minimum total compounded annual shareholder rate of return was not achieved. As a result, we wrote off to income tax expense $16.4 million of deferred tax assets related to previously recognized share-based compensation.\nIn relation to our outstanding PSUs at December 31, 2017, as our share price was lower than $32.70 for the twenty trading days ended March 22, 2018, and lower than $33.86 for the twenty trading days ended June 22, 2018, the second two tranches of PSU awards granted in 2015 expired without payment as the minimum total compounded annual shareholder rate of return was not achieved, and approximately $10.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, related to previously recognized share-based compensation expense was charged to income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInformation by Segment\nSee Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of our segment operating income to our total loss before benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nThe following table reflects our orphan and rheumatology net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 831,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 680,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 241,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in orphan and rheumatology net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Orphan and rheumatology segment operating income increased $48.9 million to $290.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $241.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of $150.6 million as described above, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $68.2 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $17.6 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the expansion of our KRYSTEXXA sales force that was initiated during the second half of 2017 and other activities to support the growth in sales of the medicine, and pre-launch costs for TEPEZZA. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the development of TEPEZZA.\nInflammation\nThe following table reflects our inflammation net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 376,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 375,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in inflammation net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018, is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Inflammation segment operating income increased $11.3 million to $160.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $149.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to stability in net sales and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $10.7 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are used and provided by us as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information on our performance, operations and profitability. Adjustments to our GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition/divestiture-related costs, upfront, progress and milestone payments related to license and collaboration agreements, drug substance harmonization costs, fees related to refinancing activities, restructuring and realignment costs, litigation settlements and charges related to discontinuation of the Friedreich's ataxia program, or the FA discontinuation, loss (gain) on sale of assets, loss on debt extinguishments, the income tax effect on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and other non-GAAP income tax adjustments, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, inventory step-up expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, long-lived assets impairment charges, and other non-cash adjustments. Certain other special items or substantive events may also be included in the non-GAAP adjustments periodically when their magnitude is significant within the periods incurred. We maintain an established non-GAAP cost policy that guides the determination of what costs will be excluded in non-GAAP measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP figures, can enhance an overall understanding of our financial and operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are included with the intent of providing investors with a more complete understanding of our historical financial results and trends and to facilitate comparisons between periods. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators our management uses for planning and forecasting purposes and measuring our performance. For example, adjusted EBITDA is used by us as one measure of management performance under certain incentive compensation arrangements. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nReconciliations of reported GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, and the related per share amounts, were as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTable 242: <table>

Following Notice 2018-28 that was issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service during the year ended December 31, 2018 and in accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118, we reinstated the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carry forwards under Section 163(j) of the Code based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent.\nOther non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflect the provisional $84.0 million net benefit recorded following the enactment of the Tax Act, which net benefit included a $143.3 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liability based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the write-off of the $59.2 million deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Code.\nLiquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses in most fiscal years since our inception in June 2005 and, as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $605.7 million. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as a result of the commercialization of our medicines, including as a result of the commercial launch of TEPEZZA, but we believe these cost increases will be more than offset by higher net sales and gross profits. Additionally, we expect that our research and development costs will increase as we acquire or develop more development-stage medicine candidates and advance our candidates through the clinical development and regulatory approval processes.\nIn February 2020, we purchased a three-building campus in Deerfield, Illinois, for total cash consideration of $115.0 million. The Deerfield campus totals 70 acres and consists of more than 650,000 square feet of office space. We expect to move to the Deerfield campus in the second half of 2020 and market our Lake Forest office for sub-lease. We expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2020 in order to prepare the Deerfield campus for occupancy.\nAs a result of the FDA approval of TEPEZZA in January 2020, we will make a milestone payment of $100.0 million under the agreement for the acquisition of River Vision during the first quarter of 2020.\nWe have financed our operations to date through equity financings, debt financings and the issuance of convertible notes, along with cash flows from operations during the last several years. During 2019, we reduced the principal amount of our total debt outstanding by $575.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,080.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt with a book value of $1,352.8 million and principal amount of $1,418.0 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our business needs for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Part of our strategy is to expand and leverage our commercial capabilities and to develop a pipeline of rare disease medicine candidates by researching, developing and commercializing innovative medicines that address unmet treatment needs for rare and rheumatic diseases. To the extent we enter into transactions to acquire medicines or businesses in the future, we may need to finance a significant portion of those acquisitions through additional debt, equity or convertible debt financings, or through the use of cash on hand.\nEquity Issuances\nOn March 11, 2019, we closed an underwritten public equity offering of 14.1 million ordinary shares at a price to the public of $24.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $326.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1.8 million additional ordinary shares.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued an aggregate of 5.1 million of our ordinary shares in connection with stock option exercises, the vesting of restricted stock units and performance stock units, and employee share purchase plan purchases. We received a total of $36.2 million in proceeds in connection with such issuances.\nAmendments to Credit Agreement, Debt Repayments and 2027 Senior Notes\nOn March 11, 2019, Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc. (formerly known as Horizon Pharma USA, Inc.), our wholly owned subsidiary, or HTUSA, received $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, or the Incremental Revolving Commitments, pursuant to an amendment to our credit agreement, dated as of May 7, 2015, with Citibank, N.A., as amended, or the Credit Agreement. The Incremental Revolving Commitments were established pursuant to an incremental facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and will provide HTUSA with $200.0 million of additional borrowing capacity, which includes a $50.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Incremental Revolving Commitments will terminate in March 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.\nOn March 18, 2019, HTUSA completed the repayment of $300.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement.\nOn April 1, 2019, we delivered a notice of partial optional redemption of $250.0 million of the 2023 Senior Notes to the trustee under the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes and the holders of the 2023 Senior Notes, which were redeemed on May 1, 2019. In connection with this early redemption, we paid a premium of $8.3 million on May 1, 2019.\nOn May 22, 2019, HTUSA borrowed approximately $518.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, or the May 2019 Refinancing Loans, pursuant to an amendment to our Credit Agreement. HTUSA used the proceeds of the May 2019 Refinancing Loans to repay the outstanding amounts under our prior term loans, which totaled approximately $518.0 million.\nOn July 16, 2019, HTUSA completed a private placement of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes, to several investment banks acting as initial purchasers, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, who subsequently resold the 2027 Senior Notes to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to certain non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nWe used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 Senior Notes, together with approximately $65.0 million in cash on hand, to redeem or prepay $625.0 million of our outstanding debt, consisting of (i) the outstanding $225.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes, (ii) the outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of our 2024 Senior Notes and (iii) $100.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of senior secured term loans under the Credit Agreement, as well as to pay the related premiums and fees and expenses, excluding accrued interest, associated with such redemption and prepayment.\nOn December 18, 2019, HTUSA borrowed approximately $418.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, or the December 2019 Refinancing Loans, pursuant to an amendment to our Credit Agreement. HTUSA used the proceeds of the December 2019 Refinancing Loans to repay the outstanding amounts under our prior term loans, which totaled approximately $418.0 million.\nFollowing these transactions, our total aggregate outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $1,418.0 million, a decrease of $575.0 million from $1,993.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nFor a more detailed description of our debt agreements, see Note 13, Debt Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis. This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, including borrowing additional funds; increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and placing us at a disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIn addition, the indenture governing our 2027 Senior Notes and our Credit Agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay junior debt and make certain investments, incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock, incur liens on assets, engage in certain asset sales or merger transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash position and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,080,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 962,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 757,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 426,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 284,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102,185\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (290,446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,596\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $426.3 million, $194.5 million and $284.3 million, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to cash collections from gross sales, partially offset by payments made related to patient assistance programs and commercial rebates for our inflammation segment medicines, and payments related to selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Operating cash flow was also used to fund interest on outstanding debt of $78.0 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales, net of operating expenses. Operating cash flow was also used to fund interest on outstanding debt of $112.5 million and income taxes of $53.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2017 by cash payments of $113.8 million for interest, $32.5 million outlay for the remaining 50 percent of the litigation settlement amount with Express Scripts, cash payments of $54.0 million for acquisition/divestiture-related costs, cash payments relating to term loan refinancing of $9.1 million, cash payments related to the discontinuation of the FA program of $7.2 million, cash payments relating to our drug substance harmonization program of $5.2 million and cash payments related to our restructuring and realignment activities of $4.7 million.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $17.9 million and $102.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $27.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the purchases of property and equipment of $17.9 million and an escrow deposit payment of $6.0 million related to the purchase of the Deerfield campus, partially offset by proceeds from the MIGERGOT transaction of $6.0 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of assets during the year, including cash proceeds of $35.0 million following the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Immedica and cash proceeds of $9.5 million following the IMUKIN sale. This was partially offset by $12.0 million we paid to MedImmune to license HZN-003 (formerly MEDI4945).\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily associated with $144.9 million of payments for the acquisition of River Vision, net of cash acquired, and associated transaction costs, and $22.3 million relating to the payment for certain rights for interferon gamma-1b. This was partially offset by $69.4 million of proceeds received from the Chiesi divestiture, net of cash divested.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $290.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $54.3 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the net repayment of $400.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement, the repayment of the outstanding principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes of $775.0 million and related early redemption premiums of $39.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our 2027 Senior Notes of $590.1 million and net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares of $326.8 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to the repayment of term loans of $845.7 million, partially offset by $818.0 million in net proceeds from term loans. In June 2018, we made a mandatory prepayment of $23.5 million under our term loan facility. In October 2018, we refinanced our term loans without changing the principal amount outstanding.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $1,693.5 million from term loans, offset in part by repayment of term loans of $1,622.8 million. We refinanced our term loans during March 2017 and October 2017. The March 2017 refinancing loans replaced the $394.0 million 2015 term loan facility and the $375.0 million 2016 incremental loan facility and the October 2017 refinancing loans replaced the October 2017 refinanced loans. The March 2017 amendment to the Credit Agreement resulted in an increase of $81.0 million of principal amount of our outstanding debt and the October 2017 refinancing loans did not result in any changes to the principal amount outstanding. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $20.0 million relating to milestones in connection with a contingent consideration liability assumed in our acquisition of Raptor.\nFinancial Condition as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nAccounts receivable, net. Accounts receivable, net, decreased $56.0 million, from $464.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $408.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower gross sales of our medicines during the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $75.4 million, from $68.2 million as of December 31, 2018 to $143.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advance payments for inventory of $29.8 million, an increase in deferred charge for taxes on intra-company profits of $24.7 million and an increase in prepaid income taxes of $6.7 million.\nDeveloped technology, net. Developed technology, net, decreased $246.8 million, from $1,945.6 million as of December 31, 2018 to $1,698.8 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the amortization of developed technology of $230.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the recording of a reduction in the net book value of $17.0 million related to the MIGERGOT transaction.\nDeferred Tax Assets, net. Deferred tax assets, net, increased $552.0 million from $3.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $555.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $553.3 million deferred tax asset resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary.\nOther assets. Other assets increased $39.3 million, from $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018 to $48.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU No. 2016-02, on January 1, 2019, we established $38.0 million of liabilities and corresponding lease assets of $36.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet for leases, primarily related to operating leases on rented office properties, that existed as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date.\nAccrued expenses. Accrued expenses increased $19.5 million, from $215.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $235.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase in allowance for returns of $6.0 million, payroll-related expenses of $6.0 million and accrued interest of $5.5 million.\nAccrued trade discounts and rebates. Accrued trade discounts and rebates increased $8.6 million, from $457.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $466.4 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in accrued government rebates and chargebacks offset by a $15.8 million decrease in co-pay and other patient assistance costs and a $14.8 million decrease in accrued commercial rebates and wholesaler fees.\nLong-term debt, net of current. Long-term debt, net of current decreased $563.2 million from $1,564.5 million as of December 31, 2018 to $1,001.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily related to the repayment of $400.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of our term loans and the repayment of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes. See Note 13, Debt Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\nDeferred tax liabilities, net. Deferred tax liabilities, net, decreased $13.6 million, from $107.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $94.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the U.S. federal and state tax credits generated during 2019 of $10.5 million and the decrease in state effective tax rate on the U.S. group net deferred tax liabilities of $1.5 million.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities increased $41.6 million, from $38.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $80.3 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to $46.5 million related to long-term lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we established $38.0 million of liabilities and corresponding lease assets of $36.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet for leases, primarily related to operating leases on rented office properties, that existed as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, minimum future cash payments due under contractual obligations, including, among others, our debt agreements, purchase agreements with third-party manufacturers and non-cancelable operating lease agreements, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2025 &\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt agreements - principal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,018,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,418,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt agreements - interest (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 402,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 471,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,191,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,060,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents the minimum contractual obligation due under the following debt agreements:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $418.0 million under the December 2019 Refinancing Loans, which includes estimated monthly interest payments based on the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2019 of 3.94% and repayment of the remaining principal in May 2026. In June 2018, we repaid $23.5 million under the mandatory prepayment provisions of the Credit Agreement. In March 2019, we completed the repayment of $300.0 million of our outstanding principal amount of term loans under the Credit Agreement following the closing of our underwritten public equity offering. In July 2019, we repaid an additional $100.0 million of our term loans under the Credit Agreement.

Lease commencement will begin when construction of the offices are completed by the lessor and we have access to begin the construction of leasehold improvements. We expect to incur leasehold improvement costs during 2020 and 2021 in order to prepare the building for occupancy.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contingent liability for uncertain tax positions amounted to $27.4 million (excluding interest and penalties). Due to the nature and timing of the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any. Therefore, our contingent liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.\nIn addition to the obligations set out in the above table, we have assumed material obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to certain third parties on net sales of certain of our medicines. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details of these material obligations.\nIn February 2020, we purchased a three-building campus in Deerfield, Illinois, for total cash consideration of $115.0 million. The Deerfield campus totals 70 acres and consists of more than 650,000 square feet of office space. We expect to move to the Deerfield campus in the second half of 2020 and market our Lake Forest office for sub-lease. We expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2020 in order to prepare the Deerfield campus for occupancy.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, other than the indemnification agreements discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should also be read in conjunction with Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the United States, we sell our medicines primarily to wholesale distributors, specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers. In other countries, we sell our medicines primarily to wholesale distributors and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our medicines to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government-mandated or privately negotiated discounts and allowances related to our medicines. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer medicines. Accordingly, revenues from medicine sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our medicines, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring medicines and is generally based upon a list or fixed price less allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts. We sell our medicines to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies under agreements with payment terms typically less than 90 days. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components does not differ materially from our historical practices.\nMedicine Sales Discounts and Allowances\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to variable consideration because of allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts. Allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts are recorded at the time of sale to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies. We apply significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances. If actual results differ from our estimates, we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future. Our adjustments to gross sales are discussed further below.\nCommercial Rebates\nWe participate in certain commercial rebate programs. Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the commercial entity or third-party administrator of the program. We calculate accrued commercial rebate estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated rebates based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the rebate as a reduction of revenue. Accrued commercial rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nCo-pay and Other Patient Assistance Programs\nWe offer discount card and other programs such as our HorizonCares program to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. We reimburse pharmacies for this discount through third-party vendors. We reduce gross sales by the amount of actual co-pay and other patient assistance in the period based on invoices received. We also record an accrual to reduce gross sales for estimated co-pay and other patient assistance on units sold to distributors that have not yet been prescribed/dispensed to a patient. We calculate accrued co-pay and other patient assistance costs using the expected value method. The estimate is based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients, average assistance paid based on reporting from the third-party vendors and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Accrued co-pay and other patient assistance costs are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nSales Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return certain medicines within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the medicine expiration date. Generally, medicines may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date and up to one year after its expiration date. The right of return expires on the earlier of one year after the medicine expiration date or the time that the medicine is dispensed to the patient. The majority of medicine returns result from medicine dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. We calculate sales returns using the expected value method. The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns. The return period is known to us based on the shelf life of medicines at the time of shipment. We record sales returns in accrued expenses\u201d and as a reduction of revenue.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe participate in certain government rebate programs such as Medicare Coverage Gap and Medicaid. We calculate accrued government rebate estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated rebates based on percentages of medicine prescribed to qualified patients, estimated rebate percentages and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel that will be prescribed to qualified patients and record the rebates as a reduction of revenue. Accrued government rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nChargebacks\nWe provide discounts to government qualified entities with whom we have contracted. These entities purchase medicines from the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors at a discounted price and the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the contracted price that the entities paid for the medicines. We calculate accrued chargeback estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated chargebacks based on contract prices, sell-through sales data obtained from third-party information and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the chargeback as a reduction of revenue. Accrued chargebacks are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We review our intangible assets when events or circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable and exceeds their fair value. We measure fair value based on the estimated future discounted cash flows associated with our assets in addition to other assumptions and projections that we deem to be reasonable and supportable. The estimated useful lives, from the date of acquisition, for all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization are between five and thirteen years.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized based on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If we conclude that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Under this method, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which a deferred tax asset can be utilized. In determining future taxable income, we are required to make assumptions including the amount of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These assumptions require significant judgment about forecasts of future taxable income. Actual operating results in future years could render our current assumption of recoverability of deferred tax assets inaccurate. The impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that the change is enacted. From time to time, we execute intra-company transactions in response to changes in operations, regulations, tax laws, funding needs and other circumstances. These transactions require the interpretation and application of tax laws in the applicable jurisdiction to support the tax treatment taken. The valuations which support the tax treatment of the transactions require significant estimates and assumptions within discounted cash flow models. We also account for the uncertainty in income taxes by utilizing a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on an income tax return. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted by each tax-paying entity within each jurisdiction in our consolidated balance sheets.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for employee share-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based payments based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each awardee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. If an award includes both a service condition and a market or performance condition, the graded vesting method is used to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods. We adopted ASU No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 and elected to retain a forfeiture rate after adoption.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Impacting Critical Accounting Policies\nRefer to Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements impacting critical accounting policies.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, business strategy and plans, financial condition, cash flows, performance, development plans and timelines, business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d will,\u201d and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, business strategy and plans, financial condition, cash flows, performance, business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances, or for any other reason.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d and Horizon\u201d refer to Horizon Therapeutics plc (formerly known as Horizon Pharma plc) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWhen accounting for business combinations under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, we previously separately identified and recorded at fair value intangible assets acquired and their related third-party contingent royalties at the date of acquisition. Third-party contingent royalties are royalties payable to parties other than sellers of the businesses. Effective January 1, 2019, we retrospectively changed our accounting for business combinations and we now record acquired intangible assets and their related third-party contingent royalties on a net basis, or the New Method. We changed our accounting principle on the basis that the use of the New Method is preferable primarily due to improved comparability with our peers. We adjusted the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2018, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to reflect this change in accounting. There was no impact on total operating, investing or financing cash flows for any period. In addition, there was no impact from the change in accounting principle on our previously reported adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for any prior period.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe are focused on researching, developing and commercializing medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare and rheumatic diseases. Our pipeline is purposeful: we apply scientific expertise and courage to bring clinically meaningful therapies to patients. We believe science and compassion must work together to transform lives.\nOn January 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved TEPEZZATM (teprotumumab-trbw), for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition.\nDuring 2019, our two reportable segments were (i) the orphan and rheumatology segment and (ii) the inflammation segment (previously the primary care segment). We report net sales and segment operating income for each segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS\u00ae to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA in the first quarter of 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our marketed medicine portfolio consisted of the following:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> Orphan and Rheumatology\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KRYSTEXXA\u00ae (pegloticase injection), for intravenous infusion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RAVICTI\u00ae (glycerol phenylbutyrate) oral liquid\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PROCYSBI\u00ae (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules, for oral use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ACTIMMUNE\u00ae (interferon gamma-1b) injection, for subcutaneous use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RAYOS (prednisone) delayed-release tablets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BUPHENYL\u00ae (sodium phenylbutyrate) tablets and powder\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> QUINSAIRTM (levofloxacin) solution for inhalation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inflammation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PENNSAID\u00ae (diclofenac sodium topical solution) 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, for topical use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DUEXIS\u00ae (ibuprofen/famotidine) tablets, for oral use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIMOVO\u00ae (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium) delayed-release tablets, for oral use\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSince January 1, 2017, we completed the following acquisitions and divestitures:\n \u2022 On June 28, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT to Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for an upfront payment and potential additional contingent consideration payments, or the MIGERGOT transaction. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura Group plc, or Vectura. Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA\u00ae in Europe to Vectura. \n \u2022 On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS (known as BUPHENYL in the United States) outside of North America and Japan to Medical Need Europe AB, part of the Immedica Group, or Immedica, and such transaction, the Immedica transaction. We previously distributed RAVICTI and AMMONAPS through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. We have retained the rights to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL in North America and Japan. \n \u2022 On June 30, 2017, we completed our acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b from Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim International, in all territories outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. Interferon gamma-1b is known as IMUKIN outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. On July 24, 2018, we sold the rights to IMUKIN in all territories outside of the United States, Canada and Japan to Clinigen Group plc, or Clinigen, for an upfront payment and a potential additional contingent consideration payment, that was subsequently received in September 2019, or the IMUKIN sale. \n \u2022 On June 23, 2017, we sold our European subsidiary that owned the marketing rights to PROCYSBI (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules and QUINSAIR (levofloxacin inhalation solution) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, regions, or the Chiesi divestiture, to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi. \n \u2022 On May 8, 2017, we completed our acquisition of River Vision Development Corp., or River Vision, which added the late development-stage rare disease biologic medicine candidate TEPEZZA to our research and development pipeline. In January 2020, the FDA approved TEPEZZA for the treatment of TED. \nThe consolidated financial statements presented herein include the results of operations of the acquired businesses from the applicable dates of acquisition. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details of our acquisitions and divestitures.\nStrategy\nHorizon today is a leading biopharma company focused on rare diseases, delivering innovative therapies to patients and generating value for our shareholders. Our strategy is to maximize the benefit and value of our key growth drivers KRYSTEXXA and TEPEZZA, both rare disease medicines, and expand our pipeline for sustainable growth. We believe our strategy allows more patients to benefit from our on-market medicines, as well as from medicines we develop as part of our pipeline. Our vision is to build healthier communities, urgently and responsibly, which in turn, we believe, generates value to our many stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nOn May 2, 2019, our shareholders approved changing our name from Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company\u201d to Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company\u201d. We believe the new name better reflects our long-term strategy to develop and commercialize innovative new medicines to address rare diseases with very few effective treatment options.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nAs of December 31, 2019, our orphan and rheumatology segment consisted of our medicines KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, QUINSAIR and RAYOS. In January 2020, the FDA approved TEPEZZA for the treatment of TED. With the exception of RAYOS, all are orphan medicines for rare diseases.\nKRYSTEXXA is the only approved medicine indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, or gout that is refractory (unresponsive) to conventional therapies. We are focused on optimizing and maximizing the peak sales potential of KRYSTEXXA through our patient-centric commercialization efforts as well as investing in education, patient and physician outreach that demonstrates the benefits KRYSTEXXA offers in treating uncontrolled gout.\nThree areas are driving growth for KRYSTEXXA: an increase in new and existing accounts; accelerating uptake by nephrologists; and growth in the adoption of the use of KRYSTEXXA with the immunomodulator methotrexate to improve the KRYSTEXXA response rate in patients with uncontrolled gout.\nImmunomodulation is one of the clinical development programs we are investing in to evaluate ways to increase the number of patients who can benefit from KRYSTEXXA. Our registrational MIRROR randomized controlled trial, or RCT, is evaluating the co-administration of KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate, the immunomodulator most often used by rheumatologists, to increase the durability of response for uncontrolled gout patients. The MIRROR RCT, which we initiated in mid-2019, was preceded by the MIRROR open-label study, which was initiated in 2018 and completed in 2019. The recently announced positive topline results of the MIRROR open-label study signify to us the value of continuing our research into the benefits of this immunomodulation approach. We are also investing to expand the use of KRYSTEXXA among nephrologists by providing additional data about the effectiveness of KRYSTEXXA in treating uncontrolled gout with its kidney-friendly mechanism of action. In October 2019, we initiated our PROTECT open-label study to evaluate the use of KRYSTEXXA in adult uncontrolled gout patients who have undergone a kidney transplant, a population that was not originally studied in the KRYSTEXXA pivotal trials. We also plan to initiate a proof of concept study in 2020 to evaluate the impact of administering KRYSTEXXA over a shorter infusion time, which could improve the experience and convenience for patients. We believe KRYSTEXXA represents a significant driver of growth for Horizon.\nTEPEZZA is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition. TEPEZZA obtained FDA approval in early 2020, after an accelerated review of the medicine and its statistically significant Phase 3 data. Our commercialization strategy for the medicine, which we recently launched, has four components: (i) establishing the market structure and simplifying the diagnosis and treatment of TED for patients; (ii) educating the multiple stakeholders about TED, the benefits of TEPEZZA and the urgency to diagnose and treat; (iii) supporting the TEPEZZA launch with our comprehensive approach and including a high-touch, patient-centric model; and (iv) facilitating access to TEPEZZA and establishing a referral process for treating physicians who may not have infusion capabilities. During 2019, we invested significantly in TEPEZZA in preparation for its potential U.S. launch, driving awareness in the medical and patient community about TED and establishing a potential pathway for treatment.\nOur clinical strategy for TEPEZZA is to evaluate additional indications for the medicine. Scientific literature suggests that the mechanism of action of TEPEZZA, which is to block the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, could have an impact on fibrotic processes. As such, we expect to initiate an exploratory TEPEZZA study in the first half of 2020 in diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, a rare fibrotic disease with no treatment options. The objective of the exploratory trial is to evaluate objective biomarker and clinical endpoints to inform potential subsequent larger and longer duration clinical trials.\nOur strategy for RAVICTI, our medicine for the treatment of urea cycle disorders, is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of urea cycle disorders; to drive conversion to RAVICTI from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate based on the medicine's differentiated benefits; to position RAVICTI as the first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.\nOur strategy for PROCYSBI, our medicine for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis, is to drive conversion of patients from older-generation immediate-release capsules of cysteamine bitartrate; to increase the use of the medicine by diagnosed but untreated patients; to identify previously undiagnosed patients who are suitable for treatment; to position PROCYSBI as a first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.\nOur strategy with respect to ACTIMMUNE, our medicine for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease, includes increasing awareness and diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease and increasing compliance rates.\nWe also market the rheumatology medicine RAYOS. As of December 31, 2019, RAYOS was included in the orphan and rheumatology segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA in the first quarter of 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.\nInflammation\nAs of December 31, 2019, our inflammation segment consisted of our medicines PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and VIMOVO. Our strategy for our inflammation medicines is to educate physicians about these clinically differentiated medicines and the benefits they offer. Patients are able to fill prescriptions for these medicines through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient assistance program, as well as other pharmacies. We offer discount card and other programs to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. In addition, we have entered into business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our inflammation medicines. The business arrangements with the PBMs generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payers for qualifying prescriptions. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we moved our medicine RAYOS, which is not an orphan medicine, to the inflammation segment.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., or collectively Dr. Reddy's, who intends to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. The cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Dr. Reddy's advising that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of VIMOVO before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. On July 30, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied our request for a rehearing of the Court's invalidity ruling against the 6,926,907 and 8,557,285 patents for VIMOVO coordinated-release tablets. As a result, the District Court entered judgment in September 2019 invalidating the \u2018907 and \u2018285 patents, which ended any restriction against the FDA from granting final approval to Dr. Reddy's generic version of VIMOVO. On February 18, 2020, the FDA granted final approval for Dr. Reddy's generic version of VIMOVO. We anticipate that Dr. Reddy's will immediately launch its product at-risk notwithstanding the ongoing patent litigation. Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Ajanta Pharma LTD, or Ajanta, intending to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. If we are unsuccessful in any of the VIMOVO cases, we will likely face generic competition with respect to VIMOVO and sales of VIMOVO will be substantially harmed.\nWe market all of our medicines in the United States through our field sales forces, which numbered approximately 480 representatives as of December 31, 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended

Net sales increased $92.4 million, or 8%, to $1,300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1,207.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net sales in our orphan and rheumatology segment of $98.1 million, offset by a decrease in net sales in our inflammation segment of $5.7 million.\nThe following table presents a summary of total net sales attributed to geographic sources for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in

Government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of gross sales are typically higher for medicines in the orphan and rheumatology segment compared to medicines in the inflammation segment.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patients' medical insurance deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual medical insurance deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased $29.1 million to $362.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $391.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 28% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a $17.0 million decrease in inventory step-up expense.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in inventory step-up expense of $17.0 million recorded to cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily related to KRYSTEXXA, inventory step-up being fully expensed by March 31, 2018, resulting in no significant inventory step-up expense being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $20.4 million to $103.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $82.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to total upfront and progress payments of $6.0 million incurred under our collaboration agreement with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC, or HemoShear, and a milestone payment of $3.0 million made to Roche relating to the TEPEZZA BLA submission to the FDA. In addition, employee-related costs increased by $6.5 million, TEPEZZA-related external costs increased by $3.3 million and KRYSTEXXA-related external costs increased by $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million to $697.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $692.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee costs of $17.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $14.0 million in legal fees and litigation settlements.\nLoss (Gain) on sale of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT for cash proceeds of $6.0 million, and we recorded a loss of $11.0 million on the sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan for cash proceeds of $35.0 million, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million on the sale. Additionally, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a potential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale. The contingent consideration payment of \u20ac3.0 million ($3.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at the date of receipt of 1.0991) was received in September 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due primarily to lower anticipated future net sales based on a Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, review. We also recorded an impairment of $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to LODOTRA as result of amendments to our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased $34.6 million to $87.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $121.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in debt interest expense of $27.9 million, primarily related to the decrease in the principal amount of our term loans, repayment of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, in May 2019 and in August 2019, repayment of our 8.750% Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Senior Notes, and an increase in interest income of $6.5 million.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $58.8 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the early redemption premiums and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the prepayment of $775.0 million of our 2023 Senior Notes and our 2024 Senior Notes, and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the $400.0 million of term loan repayments.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $593.2 million compared to $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The benefit for income taxes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $553.3 million deferred tax asset resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary.\nInformation by Segment\nSee Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of our segment operating income to our total loss before benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nThe following table reflects our orphan and rheumatology net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 929,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 831,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 306,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in orphan and rheumatology net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of $98.1 million as described above, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $69.4 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in costs to prepare for the U.S. launch of TEPEZZA.\nInflammation\nThe following table reflects our inflammation net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 370,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 376,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nThe decrease in inflammation net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income.

The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $18.6 million offset by a decrease in net sales of $5.7 million as described above. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to lower sample and patient assistance program administration expenses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,207,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,056,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 493,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102,067\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 816,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 562,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 253,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 224,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (142,200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 692,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 655,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42,985\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42,985\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 778,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 902,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (123,967\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (339,462\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 377,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121,692\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (126,523\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (192\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (260\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on divestiture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,965\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (978\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (119,349\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83,132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (458,811\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,752\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (108,686\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,380\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (350,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 311,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nNet sales.

The decrease was due to decreased shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occurred at the time we shipped, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales were not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and could therefore fluctuate significantly from period to period. Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.

This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patients' medical insurance deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual medical insurance deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2019, the 340B ceiling price rule became effective. With respect to KRYSTEXXA, the additional rebate\u201d scheme of the 340B pricing program, as applied to the historical pricing of KRYSTEXXA both before and after we acquired the medicine, have resulted in a 340B ceiling price of one penny. A material portion of KRYSTEXXA prescriptions (approximately 20 percent) are written by healthcare providers that are eligible for 340B drug pricing and therefore the reduction in 340B pricing to a penny has negatively impacted our net sales from KRYSTEXXA.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased $102.1 million to $391.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $493.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 47% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a $101.8 million decrease in inventory step-up expense.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in inventory step-up expense of $101.8 million recorded to cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily related to KRYSTEXXA, PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up expense. KRYSTEXXA inventory step-up expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $17.0 million compared to $78.3 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.3 million compared to $40.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $142.2 million to $82.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $225.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to $150.3 million related to the acquisition of River Vision during the year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, as amended by ASU No. 2017-01, we accounted for the River Vision acquisition as the purchase of an in-process research and development, or IPR&D, asset and, pursuant to ASC 730, Research and Development, or ASC 730, recorded the purchase as a research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement to license HZN-003, a rheumatology pipeline program with the objective of enhancing our leadership position in the uncontrolled gout market, from MedImmune LLC, or MedImmune, and we paid MedImmune an upfront cash payment of $12.0 million which we recorded as a research and development\u201d expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017 and included in accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2017. The upfront payment was subsequently paid in January 2018. Excluding the costs attributable to the acquisition of River Vision and HZN-003, research and development expenses increased by $20.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the costs associated with the development of TEPEZZA.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37.4 million to $692.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $655.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our KRYSTEXXA sales force that was initiated during the second half of 2017 and other activities to support the growth in sales of the medicine, and pre-launch costs for TEPEZZA.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due primarily to lower anticipated future net sales based on a Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, review. We also recorded an impairment of $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to LODOTRA as result of amendments to our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019. Impairment of long-lived assets of $22.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, represents the impairment of a non-current asset recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was previously included within selling, general and administrative\u201d expenses. On July 24, 2018, we completed the IMUKIN sale as further described in the next paragraph.\nGain on sale of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan for cash proceeds of $35.0 million, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million on the sale. Additionally, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a potential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased $4.8 million to $121.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $126.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $8.5 million primarily due to higher cash balances, partially offset by an increase of $3.7 million in interest expense.\nGain on divestiture. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the Chiesi divestiture for an upfront payment of $72.5 million, which reflects $3.1 million of cash divested, with additional potential milestone payments based on sales thresholds, and we recorded a gain of $8.0 million on the divestiture.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $44.8 million compared to $108.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The reduction in benefit for income taxes of $63.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax losses and the tax rate at which some of these reduced losses were tax effected resulting in a tax provision of $57.9 million and income tax expense of $45.8 million generated on an intra-company transfer of assets other than inventory during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of $84.0 million net benefit following the enactment in the United States of H.R. 1, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, in December 2017, which net benefit included a $143.3 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liability based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the write-off of the $59.2 million deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the date of enactment for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, we reflected the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete. To the extent that our accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act was incomplete but it was possible to determine a reasonable estimate, we recorded a provisional estimate in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017.\nOn April 2, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2018-28, or the Notice, which provided guidance for computing the business interest expense limitation under the Tax Act and clarified the treatment of interest disallowed and carried forward under Section 163(j) of the Code prior to enactment of the Tax Act. In accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118 and the guidance in the Notice we reinstated the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. The impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118 during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a $37.4 million increase to our benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. We had no other material measurement period adjustments under SAB 118.\nThe remainder of the decrease in benefit for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a tax provision of $8.1 million attributable to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to an increase in U.S. state effective tax rates attributable to the enactment of certain U.S. state legislation during the year ended December 31, 2018. These decreases to the benefit for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018 were partially offset by an income tax expense of $51.1 million on non-deductible research and development costs which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and did not re-occur for the year ended December 31, 2018, a tax benefit of $42.7 million U.S. federal tax and $7.9 million U.S. state tax benefit on the liquidation of a foreign partnership owned by us during the year ended December 31, 2018 and decreases to our current state income tax expense of $6.8 million resulting from current year pre-tax losses incurred in the U.S. group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the first of three tranches of our outstanding performance stock unit awards, or PSUs, issued in 2015 expired without payout as the minimum total compounded annual shareholder rate of return was not achieved. As a result, we wrote off to income tax expense $16.4 million of deferred tax assets related to previously recognized share-based compensation.\nIn relation to our outstanding PSUs at December 31, 2017, as our share price was lower than $32.70 for the twenty trading days ended March 22, 2018, and lower than $33.86 for the twenty trading days ended June 22, 2018, the second two tranches of PSU awards granted in 2015 expired without payment as the minimum total compounded annual shareholder rate of return was not achieved, and approximately $10.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, related to previously recognized share-based compensation expense was charged to income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInformation by Segment\nSee Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of our segment operating income to our total loss before benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nThe following table reflects our orphan and rheumatology net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 831,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 680,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 241,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in orphan and rheumatology net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Orphan and rheumatology segment operating income increased $48.9 million to $290.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $241.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of $150.6 million as described above, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $68.2 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $17.6 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the expansion of our KRYSTEXXA sales force that was initiated during the second half of 2017 and other activities to support the growth in sales of the medicine, and pre-launch costs for TEPEZZA. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the development of TEPEZZA.\nInflammation\nThe following table reflects our inflammation net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 376,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 375,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nThe increase in inflammation net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018, is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Inflammation segment operating income increased $11.3 million to $160.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $149.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to stability in net sales and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $10.7 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are used and provided by us as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information on our performance, operations and profitability. Adjustments to our GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition/divestiture-related costs, upfront, progress and milestone payments related to license and collaboration agreements, drug substance harmonization costs, fees related to refinancing activities, restructuring and realignment costs, litigation settlements and charges related to discontinuation of the Friedreich's ataxia program, or the FA discontinuation, loss (gain) on sale of assets, loss on debt extinguishments, the income tax effect on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and other non-GAAP income tax adjustments, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, inventory step-up expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, long-lived assets impairment charges, and other non-cash adjustments. Certain other special items or substantive events may also be included in the non-GAAP adjustments periodically when their magnitude is significant within the periods incurred. We maintain an established non-GAAP cost policy that guides the determination of what costs will be excluded in non-GAAP measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP figures, can enhance an overall understanding of our financial and operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are included with the intent of providing investors with a more complete understanding of our historical financial results and trends and to facilitate comparisons between periods. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators our management uses for planning and forecasting purposes and measuring our performance. For example, adjusted EBITDA is used by us as one measure of management performance under certain incentive compensation arrangements. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nReconciliations of reported GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, and the related per share amounts, were as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTable 242: <table>

PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, RAYOS, BUPHENYL, LODOTRA, PENNSAID 2%, VIMOVO and MIGERGOT. \n (3) During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized in cost of goods sold $17.3 million for inventory step-up expense primarily related to KRYSTEXXA inventory sold. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized in cost of goods sold $78.3 million for inventory step-up expense related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT inventory sold and $40.8 million for inventory step-up expense related to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory sold.\n (4) Represents share-based compensation expense associated with our stock option, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants to our employees and non-employee directors and our employee share purchase plan. \n (5) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $58.8 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the early redemption premiums and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the prepayment of $775.0 million of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the $400.0 million of term loan repayments. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into two refinancing amendments for our term loans. We accounted for a portion of the repayments under these refinancing amendments as a debt extinguishment and recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $1.0 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the write-off of the unamortized portion of debt discount and deferred financing costs previously incurred and a 1 percent prepayment penalty fee.\n (6) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss of $11.0 million on the sale of our rights to MIGERGOT. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a\npotential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale. The\ncontingent consideration payment of \u20ac3.0 million ($3.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at the date of receipt of 1.0991) was received in September 2019. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Medical Need Europe AB, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million.\n (7) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an upfront, progress and milestone payments related to license and collaboration agreements of $9.1 million which was composed of a $3.0 million milestone payment to Roche relating to the TEPEZZA BLA submission to the FDA during the third quarter of 2019, and an upfront cash payment of $2.0 million and a progress payment of $4.0 million in relation to the collaboration agreement with HemoShear. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $12.2 million of upfront and milestone payments related to license agreements, primarily related to our agreement to license HZN-003 (formerly MEDI4945), a rheumatology pipeline program with the objective of enhancing our leadership position in the uncontrolled gout market, from MedImmune for an upfront cash payment of $12.0 million.\n (8) Represents expenses, including legal and consulting fees, incurred in connection with our acquisitions and divestitures. Costs recovered from subleases of acquired facilities and reimbursed expenses incurred under transition arrangements for divestitures are also reflected in this line-item. \n (9) Represents arrangement and other fees relating to our refinancing activities. \n (10) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded charges related to the FA discontinuation of $1.1 million, primarily due to the remeasurement of an inventory purchase commitment liability. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a reduction to previously incurred charges relating to the FA discontinuation of $1.5 million reflecting lower costs to discontinue the clinical trial than previously anticipated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded charges relating to the FA discontinuation of $0.2 million.\n (11) We recorded $1.0 million and $5.8 million of expense during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for litigation settlements. \n (12) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, marketed as IMUKIN in an estimated thirty countries primarily in Europe and the Middle East, or the IMUKIN purchase agreement. We already owned the rights to interferon gamma-1b marketed as ACTIMMUNE in the United States, Canada and Japan. In connection with the IMUKIN purchase agreement, we also committed to pay our contract manufacturer certain amounts related to the harmonization of the manufacturing processes for ACTIMMUNE and IMUKIN drug substance, or the harmonization program. At the time we entered into the IMUKIN purchase agreement and the harmonization program commitment was made, we had anticipated achieving certain benefits should the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA be successful. If the study had been successful and if U.S. marketing approval had subsequently been obtained, we had forecasted significant increases in demand for the medicine and the harmonization program would have resulted in significant benefits for us. Following our discontinuation of the FA program, we determined that certain assets, including an upfront payment related to the IMUKIN purchase agreement, were impaired, and the costs under the harmonization program would no longer have benefit to us and should be expensed as incurred. \n (13) Represents expenses, including severance costs and consulting fees, related to restructuring and realignment activities. \n (14) Impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily relates to the write-off of the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America and LODOTRA. \nImpairment of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $22.3 million relates to an impairment recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was presented in the charges relating to the discontinuation of the Friedreich's ataxia program\u201d line item in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n (15) During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the divestiture of a European subsidiary that owns the marketing rights to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR in EMEA to Chiesi and in connection with this divestiture we recorded a gain of $8.0 million. \n (16) Represents amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with our debt. \n (17) Income tax adjustments on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments represent the estimated income tax impact of each pre-tax \nnon-GAAP adjustment based on the statutory income tax rate of the applicable jurisdictions for each non-GAAP adjustment.\n (18) Other non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflect a tax benefit of $553.3 million resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary. \nOther non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflect the impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118, which was a $37.4 million increase to our benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. Following Notice 2018-28 that was issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service during the year ended December 31, 2018 and in accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118, we reinstated the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carry forwards under Section 163(j) of the Code based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent.\nOther non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflect the provisional $84.0 million net benefit recorded following the enactment of the Tax Act, which net benefit included a $143.3 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liability based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the write-off of the $59.2 million deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Code.\nLiquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses in most fiscal years since our inception in June 2005 and, as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $605.7 million. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as a result of the commercialization of our medicines, including as a result of the commercial launch of TEPEZZA, but we believe these cost increases will be more than offset by higher net sales and gross profits. Additionally, we expect that our research and development costs will increase as we acquire or develop more development-stage medicine candidates and advance our candidates through the clinical development and regulatory approval processes.\nIn February 2020, we purchased a three-building campus in Deerfield, Illinois, for total cash consideration of $115.0 million. The Deerfield campus totals 70 acres and consists of more than 650,000 square feet of office space. We expect to move to the Deerfield campus in the second half of 2020 and market our Lake Forest office for sub-lease. We expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2020 in order to prepare the Deerfield campus for occupancy.\nAs a result of the FDA approval of TEPEZZA in January 2020, we will make a milestone payment of $100.0 million under the agreement for the acquisition of River Vision during the first quarter of 2020.\nWe have financed our operations to date through equity financings, debt financings and the issuance of convertible notes, along with cash flows from operations during the last several years. During 2019, we reduced the principal amount of our total debt outstanding by $575.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,080.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt with a book value of $1,352.8 million and principal amount of $1,418.0 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our business needs for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Part of our strategy is to expand and leverage our commercial capabilities and to develop a pipeline of rare disease medicine candidates by researching, developing and commercializing innovative medicines that address unmet treatment needs for rare and rheumatic diseases. To the extent we enter into transactions to acquire medicines or businesses in the future, we may need to finance a significant portion of those acquisitions through additional debt, equity or convertible debt financings, or through the use of cash on hand.\nEquity Issuances\nOn March 11, 2019, we closed an underwritten public equity offering of 14.1 million ordinary shares at a price to the public of $24.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $326.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1.8 million additional ordinary shares.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued an aggregate of 5.1 million of our ordinary shares in connection with stock option exercises, the vesting of restricted stock units and performance stock units, and employee share purchase plan purchases. We received a total of $36.2 million in proceeds in connection with such issuances.\nAmendments to Credit Agreement, Debt Repayments and 2027 Senior Notes\nOn March 11, 2019, Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc. (formerly known as Horizon Pharma USA, Inc.), our wholly owned subsidiary, or HTUSA, received $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, or the Incremental Revolving Commitments, pursuant to an amendment to our credit agreement, dated as of May 7, 2015, with Citibank, N.A., as amended, or the Credit Agreement. The Incremental Revolving Commitments were established pursuant to an incremental facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and will provide HTUSA with $200.0 million of additional borrowing capacity, which includes a $50.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Incremental Revolving Commitments will terminate in March 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.\nOn March 18, 2019, HTUSA completed the repayment of $300.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement.\nOn April 1, 2019, we delivered a notice of partial optional redemption of $250.0 million of the 2023 Senior Notes to the trustee under the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes and the holders of the 2023 Senior Notes, which were redeemed on May 1, 2019. In connection with this early redemption, we paid a premium of $8.3 million on May 1, 2019.\nOn May 22, 2019, HTUSA borrowed approximately $518.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, or the May 2019 Refinancing Loans, pursuant to an amendment to our Credit Agreement. HTUSA used the proceeds of the May 2019 Refinancing Loans to repay the outstanding amounts under our prior term loans, which totaled approximately $518.0 million.\nOn July 16, 2019, HTUSA completed a private placement of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes, to several investment banks acting as initial purchasers, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, who subsequently resold the 2027 Senior Notes to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to certain non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nWe used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 Senior Notes, together with approximately $65.0 million in cash on hand, to redeem or prepay $625.0 million of our outstanding debt, consisting of (i) the outstanding $225.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes, (ii) the outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of our 2024 Senior Notes and (iii) $100.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of senior secured term loans under the Credit Agreement, as well as to pay the related premiums and fees and expenses, excluding accrued interest, associated with such redemption and prepayment.\nOn December 18, 2019, HTUSA borrowed approximately $418.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, or the December 2019 Refinancing Loans, pursuant to an amendment to our Credit Agreement. HTUSA used the proceeds of the December 2019 Refinancing Loans to repay the outstanding amounts under our prior term loans, which totaled approximately $418.0 million.\nFollowing these transactions, our total aggregate outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $1,418.0 million, a decrease of $575.0 million from $1,993.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nFor a more detailed description of our debt agreements, see Note 13, Debt Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis. This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, including borrowing additional funds; increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and placing us at a disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIn addition, the indenture governing our 2027 Senior Notes and our Credit Agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay junior debt and make certain investments, incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock, incur liens on assets, engage in certain asset sales or merger transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash position and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,080,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 962,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 757,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 426,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 284,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102,185\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (290,446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,596\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $426.3 million, $194.5 million and $284.3 million, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to cash collections from gross sales, partially offset by payments made related to patient assistance programs and commercial rebates for our inflammation segment medicines, and payments related to selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Operating cash flow was also used to fund interest on outstanding debt of $78.0 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales, net of operating expenses. Operating cash flow was also used to fund interest on outstanding debt of $112.5 million and income taxes of $53.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2017 by cash payments of $113.8 million for interest, $32.5 million outlay for the remaining 50 percent of the litigation settlement amount with Express Scripts, cash payments of $54.0 million for acquisition/divestiture-related costs, cash payments relating to term loan refinancing of $9.1 million, cash payments related to the discontinuation of the FA program of $7.2 million, cash payments relating to our drug substance harmonization program of $5.2 million and cash payments related to our restructuring and realignment activities of $4.7 million.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $17.9 million and $102.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $27.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the purchases of property and equipment of $17.9 million and an escrow deposit payment of $6.0 million related to the purchase of the Deerfield campus, partially offset by proceeds from the MIGERGOT transaction of $6.0 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of assets during the year, including cash proceeds of $35.0 million following the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Immedica and cash proceeds of $9.5 million following the IMUKIN sale. This was partially offset by $12.0 million we paid to MedImmune to license HZN-003 (formerly MEDI4945).\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily associated with $144.9 million of payments for the acquisition of River Vision, net of cash acquired, and associated transaction costs, and $22.3 million relating to the payment for certain rights for interferon gamma-1b. This was partially offset by $69.4 million of proceeds received from the Chiesi divestiture, net of cash divested.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $290.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $54.3 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the net repayment of $400.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement, the repayment of the outstanding principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes of $775.0 million and related early redemption premiums of $39.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our 2027 Senior Notes of $590.1 million and net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares of $326.8 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to the repayment of term loans of $845.7 million, partially offset by $818.0 million in net proceeds from term loans. In June 2018, we made a mandatory prepayment of $23.5 million under our term loan facility. In October 2018, we refinanced our term loans without changing the principal amount outstanding.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $1,693.5 million from term loans, offset in part by repayment of term loans of $1,622.8 million. We refinanced our term loans during March 2017 and October 2017. The March 2017 refinancing loans replaced the $394.0 million 2015 term loan facility and the $375.0 million 2016 incremental loan facility and the October 2017 refinancing loans replaced the October 2017 refinanced loans. The March 2017 amendment to the Credit Agreement resulted in an increase of $81.0 million of principal amount of our outstanding debt and the October 2017 refinancing loans did not result in any changes to the principal amount outstanding. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $20.0 million relating to milestones in connection with a contingent consideration liability assumed in our acquisition of Raptor.\nFinancial Condition as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nAccounts receivable, net. Accounts receivable, net, decreased $56.0 million, from $464.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $408.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower gross sales of our medicines during the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $75.4 million, from $68.2 million as of December 31, 2018 to $143.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advance payments for inventory of $29.8 million, an increase in deferred charge for taxes on intra-company profits of $24.7 million and an increase in prepaid income taxes of $6.7 million.\nDeveloped technology, net. Developed technology, net, decreased $246.8 million, from $1,945.6 million as of December 31, 2018 to $1,698.8 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the amortization of developed technology of $230.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the recording of a reduction in the net book value of $17.0 million related to the MIGERGOT transaction.\nDeferred Tax Assets, net. Deferred tax assets, net, increased $552.0 million from $3.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $555.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $553.3 million deferred tax asset resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary.\nOther assets. Other assets increased $39.3 million, from $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018 to $48.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU No. 2016-02, on January 1, 2019, we established $38.0 million of liabilities and corresponding lease assets of $36.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet for leases, primarily related to operating leases on rented office properties, that existed as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date.\nAccrued expenses. Accrued expenses increased $19.5 million, from $215.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $235.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase in allowance for returns of $6.0 million, payroll-related expenses of $6.0 million and accrued interest of $5.5 million.\nAccrued trade discounts and rebates. Accrued trade discounts and rebates increased $8.6 million, from $457.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $466.4 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in accrued government rebates and chargebacks offset by a $15.8 million decrease in co-pay and other patient assistance costs and a $14.8 million decrease in accrued commercial rebates and wholesaler fees.\nLong-term debt, net of current. Long-term debt, net of current decreased $563.2 million from $1,564.5 million as of December 31, 2018 to $1,001.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily related to the repayment of $400.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of our term loans and the repayment of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes. See Note 13, Debt Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\nDeferred tax liabilities, net. Deferred tax liabilities, net, decreased $13.6 million, from $107.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $94.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the U.S. federal and state tax credits generated during 2019 of $10.5 million and the decrease in state effective tax rate on the U.S. group net deferred tax liabilities of $1.5 million.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities increased $41.6 million, from $38.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $80.3 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to $46.5 million related to long-term lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we established $38.0 million of liabilities and corresponding lease assets of $36.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet for leases, primarily related to operating leases on rented office properties, that existed as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, minimum future cash payments due under contractual obligations, including, among others, our debt agreements, purchase agreements with third-party manufacturers and non-cancelable operating lease agreements, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2025 &\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt agreements - principal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,018,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,418,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt agreements - interest (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 402,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 471,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,191,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,060,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the minimum contractual obligation due under the following debt agreements: \n \u2022 $418.0 million under the December 2019 Refinancing Loans, which includes estimated monthly interest payments based on the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2019 of 3.94% and repayment of the remaining principal in May 2026. In June 2018, we repaid $23.5 million under the mandatory prepayment provisions of the Credit Agreement. In March 2019, we completed the repayment of $300.0 million of our outstanding principal amount of term loans under the Credit Agreement following the closing of our underwritten public equity offering. In July 2019, we repaid an additional $100.0 million of our term loans under the Credit Agreement. Following these repayments, our outstanding principal balance of term loans under the Credit Agreement was $418.0 million and we are not required to pay any further quarterly installments. \n \u2022 $600.0 million 2027 Senior Notes, which includes bi-annual interest payments and repayment of the principal in August 2027. \n \u2022 $400.0 million Exchangeable Senior Notes, which includes bi-annual interest payments and repayment of the principal in March 2022. \n (2) These amounts reflect the following purchase commitments with our third-party manufacturers: \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for TEPEZZA drugs substance with AGC Biologics A/S to be delivered through the second half of 2021. Purchase commitments with Catalent Indiana, LLC for TEPEZZA drug product to be delivered through December 2020. \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for PROCYSBI through March 2020. \n \u2022 Minimum annual order quantities required to be placed with Boehringer Ingelheim for final packaged ACTIMMUNE through July 2024 and additional units we also committed to purchase which were intended to cover anticipated demand if the results of the FA program of ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA had been successful. As of December 31, 2019, the minimum binding purchase commitment to Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals, was $15.6 million (converted using a Dollar-to-Euro exchange rate of 1.1215) through July 2024. \n \u2022 A commitment to spend $0.7 million with Boehringer Ingelheim related to the harmonization of the manufacturing process for ACTIMMUNE drug substance. \n \u2022 Minimum purchase commitment for KRYSTEXXA through 2026. \n \u2022 Minimum purchase commitment for RAYOS tablets from Jagotec AG through December 2023. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2019, the minimum purchase commitment based on tablet pricing in effect under the agreement was $2.0 million through March 2020. Purchase commitment for final packaged PENNSAID 2% from Nuvo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (formerly known as Nuvo Research Inc.) through March 2020. \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for final packaged DUEXIS tablets from Sanofi-Aventis U.S. through June 2020. \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for RAVICTI, BUPHENYL and QUINSAIR outstanding at December 31, 2019. \n (3) These amounts reflect payments due under our operating leases, which are principally for our facilities. For further details regarding these properties, see Item 2 of Part I, Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe above table does not include details of an agreement to lease entered into on October 14, 2019, relating to approximately 63,000 square feet of office space under construction in Dublin, Ireland. Lease commencement will begin when construction of the offices are completed by the lessor and we have access to begin the construction of leasehold improvements. We expect to incur leasehold improvement costs during 2020 and 2021 in order to prepare the building for occupancy.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contingent liability for uncertain tax positions amounted to $27.4 million (excluding interest and penalties). Due to the nature and timing of the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any. Therefore, our contingent liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.\nIn addition to the obligations set out in the above table, we have assumed material obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to certain third parties on net sales of certain of our medicines. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details of these material obligations.\nIn February 2020, we purchased a three-building campus in Deerfield, Illinois, for total cash consideration of $115.0 million. The Deerfield campus totals 70 acres and consists of more than 650,000 square feet of office space. We expect to move to the Deerfield campus in the second half of 2020 and market our Lake Forest office for sub-lease. We expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2020 in order to prepare the Deerfield campus for occupancy.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, other than the indemnification agreements discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should also be read in conjunction with Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the United States, we sell our medicines primarily to wholesale distributors, specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers. In other countries, we sell our medicines primarily to wholesale distributors and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our medicines to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government-mandated or privately negotiated discounts and allowances related to our medicines. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer medicines. Accordingly, revenues from medicine sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our medicines, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring medicines and is generally based upon a list or fixed price less allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts. We sell our medicines to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies under agreements with payment terms typically less than 90 days. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components does not differ materially from our historical practices.\nMedicine Sales Discounts and Allowances\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to variable consideration because of allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts. Allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts are recorded at the time of sale to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies. We apply significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances. If actual results differ from our estimates, we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future. Our adjustments to gross sales are discussed further below.\nCommercial Rebates\nWe participate in certain commercial rebate programs. Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the commercial entity or third-party administrator of the program. We calculate accrued commercial rebate estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated rebates based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the rebate as a reduction of revenue. Accrued commercial rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nCo-pay and Other Patient Assistance Programs\nWe offer discount card and other programs such as our HorizonCares program to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. We reimburse pharmacies for this discount through third-party vendors. We reduce gross sales by the amount of actual co-pay and other patient assistance in the period based on invoices received. We also record an accrual to reduce gross sales for estimated co-pay and other patient assistance on units sold to distributors that have not yet been prescribed/dispensed to a patient. We calculate accrued co-pay and other patient assistance costs using the expected value method. The estimate is based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients, average assistance paid based on reporting from the third-party vendors and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Accrued co-pay and other patient assistance costs are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nSales Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return certain medicines within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the medicine expiration date. Generally, medicines may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date and up to one year after its expiration date. The right of return expires on the earlier of one year after the medicine expiration date or the time that the medicine is dispensed to the patient. The majority of medicine returns result from medicine dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. We calculate sales returns using the expected value method. The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns. The return period is known to us based on the shelf life of medicines at the time of shipment. We record sales returns in accrued expenses\u201d and as a reduction of revenue.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe participate in certain government rebate programs such as Medicare Coverage Gap and Medicaid. We calculate accrued government rebate estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated rebates based on percentages of medicine prescribed to qualified patients, estimated rebate percentages and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel that will be prescribed to qualified patients and record the rebates as a reduction of revenue. Accrued government rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nChargebacks\nWe provide discounts to government qualified entities with whom we have contracted. These entities purchase medicines from the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors at a discounted price and the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the contracted price that the entities paid for the medicines. We calculate accrued chargeback estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated chargebacks based on contract prices, sell-through sales data obtained from third-party information and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the chargeback as a reduction of revenue. Accrued chargebacks are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We review our intangible assets when events or circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable and exceeds their fair value. We measure fair value based on the estimated future discounted cash flows associated with our assets in addition to other assumptions and projections that we deem to be reasonable and supportable. The estimated useful lives, from the date of acquisition, for all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization are between five and thirteen years.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized based on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If we conclude that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Under this method, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which a deferred tax asset can be utilized. In determining future taxable income, we are required to make assumptions including the amount of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These assumptions require significant judgment about forecasts of future taxable income. Actual operating results in future years could render our current assumption of recoverability of deferred tax assets inaccurate. The impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that the change is enacted. From time to time, we execute intra-company transactions in response to changes in operations, regulations, tax laws, funding needs and other circumstances. These transactions require the interpretation and application of tax laws in the applicable jurisdiction to support the tax treatment taken. The valuations which support the tax treatment of the transactions require significant estimates and assumptions within discounted cash flow models. We also account for the uncertainty in income taxes by utilizing a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on an income tax return. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted by each tax-paying entity within each jurisdiction in our consolidated balance sheets.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for employee share-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based payments based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each awardee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. If an award includes both a service condition and a market or performance condition, the graded vesting method is used to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods. We adopted ASU No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 and elected to retain a forfeiture rate after adoption.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Impacting Critical Accounting Policies\nRefer to Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements impacting critical accounting policies.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, business strategy and plans, financial condition, cash flows, performance, development plans and timelines, business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d will,\u201d and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, business strategy and plans, financial condition, cash flows, performance, business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances, or for any other reason.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d and Horizon\u201d refer to Horizon Therapeutics plc (formerly known as Horizon Pharma plc) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWhen accounting for business combinations under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, we previously separately identified and recorded at fair value intangible assets acquired and their related third-party contingent royalties at the date of acquisition. Third-party contingent royalties are royalties payable to parties other than sellers of the businesses. Effective January 1, 2019, we retrospectively changed our accounting for business combinations and we now record acquired intangible assets and their related third-party contingent royalties on a net basis, or the New Method. We changed our accounting principle on the basis that the use of the New Method is preferable primarily due to improved comparability with our peers. We adjusted the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2018, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to reflect this change in accounting. There was no impact on total operating, investing or financing cash flows for any period. In addition, there was no impact from the change in accounting principle on our previously reported adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for any prior period.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe are focused on researching, developing and commercializing medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare and rheumatic diseases. Our pipeline is purposeful: we apply scientific expertise and courage to bring clinically meaningful therapies to patients. We believe science and compassion must work together to transform lives.\nOn January 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved TEPEZZATM (teprotumumab-trbw), for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition.\nDuring 2019, our two reportable segments were (i) the orphan and rheumatology segment and (ii) the inflammation segment (previously the primary care segment). We report net sales and segment operating income for each segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS\u00ae to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA in the first quarter of 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our marketed medicine portfolio consisted of the following:\n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSince January 1, 2017, we completed the following acquisitions and divestitures:\n \u2022 On June 28, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT to Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for an upfront payment and potential additional contingent consideration payments, or the MIGERGOT transaction. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura Group plc, or Vectura. Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA\u00ae in Europe to Vectura. \n \u2022 On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS (known as BUPHENYL in the United States) outside of North America and Japan to Medical Need Europe AB, part of the Immedica Group, or Immedica, and such transaction, the Immedica transaction. We previously distributed RAVICTI and AMMONAPS through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. We have retained the rights to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL in North America and Japan. \n \u2022 On June 30, 2017, we completed our acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b from Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim International, in all territories outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. Interferon gamma-1b is known as IMUKIN outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. On July 24, 2018, we sold the rights to IMUKIN in all territories outside of the United States, Canada and Japan to Clinigen Group plc, or Clinigen, for an upfront payment and a potential additional contingent consideration payment, that was subsequently received in September 2019, or the IMUKIN sale. \n \u2022 On June 23, 2017, we sold our European subsidiary that owned the marketing rights to PROCYSBI (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules and QUINSAIR (levofloxacin inhalation solution) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, regions, or the Chiesi divestiture, to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi. \n \u2022 On May 8, 2017, we completed our acquisition of River Vision Development Corp., or River Vision, which added the late development-stage rare disease biologic medicine candidate TEPEZZA to our research and development pipeline. In January 2020, the FDA approved TEPEZZA for the treatment of TED. \nThe consolidated financial statements presented herein include the results of operations of the acquired businesses from the applicable dates of acquisition. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details of our acquisitions and divestitures.\nStrategy\nHorizon today is a leading biopharma company focused on rare diseases, delivering innovative therapies to patients and generating value for our shareholders. Our strategy is to maximize the benefit and value of our key growth drivers KRYSTEXXA and TEPEZZA, both rare disease medicines, and expand our pipeline for sustainable growth. We believe our strategy allows more patients to benefit from our on-market medicines, as well as from medicines we develop as part of our pipeline. Our vision is to build healthier communities, urgently and responsibly, which in turn, we believe, generates value to our many stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nOn May 2, 2019, our shareholders approved changing our name from Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company\u201d to Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company\u201d. We believe the new name better reflects our long-term strategy to develop and commercialize innovative new medicines to address rare diseases with very few effective treatment options.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nAs of December 31, 2019, our orphan and rheumatology segment consisted of our medicines KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, QUINSAIR and RAYOS. In January 2020, the FDA approved TEPEZZA for the treatment of TED. With the exception of RAYOS, all are orphan medicines for rare diseases.\nKRYSTEXXA is the only approved medicine indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, or gout that is refractory (unresponsive) to conventional therapies. We are focused on optimizing and maximizing the peak sales potential of KRYSTEXXA through our patient-centric commercialization efforts as well as investing in education, patient and physician outreach that demonstrates the benefits KRYSTEXXA offers in treating uncontrolled gout.\nThree areas are driving growth for KRYSTEXXA: an increase in new and existing accounts; accelerating uptake by nephrologists; and growth in the adoption of the use of KRYSTEXXA with the immunomodulator methotrexate to improve the KRYSTEXXA response rate in patients with uncontrolled gout.\nImmunomodulation is one of the clinical development programs we are investing in to evaluate ways to increase the number of patients who can benefit from KRYSTEXXA. Our registrational MIRROR randomized controlled trial, or RCT, is evaluating the co-administration of KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate, the immunomodulator most often used by rheumatologists, to increase the durability of response for uncontrolled gout patients. The MIRROR RCT, which we initiated in mid-2019, was preceded by the MIRROR open-label study, which was initiated in 2018 and completed in 2019. The recently announced positive topline results of the MIRROR open-label study signify to us the value of continuing our research into the benefits of this immunomodulation approach. We are also investing to expand the use of KRYSTEXXA among nephrologists by providing additional data about the effectiveness of KRYSTEXXA in treating uncontrolled gout with its kidney-friendly mechanism of action. In October 2019, we initiated our PROTECT open-label study to evaluate the use of KRYSTEXXA in adult uncontrolled gout patients who have undergone a kidney transplant, a population that was not originally studied in the KRYSTEXXA pivotal trials. We also plan to initiate a proof of concept study in 2020 to evaluate the impact of administering KRYSTEXXA over a shorter infusion time, which could improve the experience and convenience for patients. We believe KRYSTEXXA represents a significant driver of growth for Horizon.\nTEPEZZA is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition. TEPEZZA obtained FDA approval in early 2020, after an accelerated review of the medicine and its statistically significant Phase 3 data. Our commercialization strategy for the medicine, which we recently launched, has four components: (i) establishing the market structure and simplifying the diagnosis and treatment of TED for patients; (ii) educating the multiple stakeholders about TED, the benefits of TEPEZZA and the urgency to diagnose and treat; (iii) supporting the TEPEZZA launch with our comprehensive approach and including a high-touch, patient-centric model; and (iv) facilitating access to TEPEZZA and establishing a referral process for treating physicians who may not have infusion capabilities. During 2019, we invested significantly in TEPEZZA in preparation for its potential U.S. launch, driving awareness in the medical and patient community about TED and establishing a potential pathway for treatment.\nOur clinical strategy for TEPEZZA is to evaluate additional indications for the medicine. Scientific literature suggests that the mechanism of action of TEPEZZA, which is to block the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, could have an impact on fibrotic processes. As such, we expect to initiate an exploratory TEPEZZA study in the first half of 2020 in diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, a rare fibrotic disease with no treatment options. The objective of the exploratory trial is to evaluate objective biomarker and clinical endpoints to inform potential subsequent larger and longer duration clinical trials.\nOur strategy for RAVICTI, our medicine for the treatment of urea cycle disorders, is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of urea cycle disorders; to drive conversion to RAVICTI from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate based on the medicine's differentiated benefits; to position RAVICTI as the first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.\nOur strategy for PROCYSBI, our medicine for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis, is to drive conversion of patients from older-generation immediate-release capsules of cysteamine bitartrate; to increase the use of the medicine by diagnosed but untreated patients; to identify previously undiagnosed patients who are suitable for treatment; to position PROCYSBI as a first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.\nOur strategy with respect to ACTIMMUNE, our medicine for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease, includes increasing awareness and diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease and increasing compliance rates.\nWe also market the rheumatology medicine RAYOS. As of December 31, 2019, RAYOS was included in the orphan and rheumatology segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA in the first quarter of 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.\nInflammation\nAs of December 31, 2019, our inflammation segment consisted of our medicines PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and VIMOVO. Our strategy for our inflammation medicines is to educate physicians about these clinically differentiated medicines and the benefits they offer. Patients are able to fill prescriptions for these medicines through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient assistance program, as well as other pharmacies. We offer discount card and other programs to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. In addition, we have entered into business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our inflammation medicines. The business arrangements with the PBMs generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payers for qualifying prescriptions. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we moved our medicine RAYOS, which is not an orphan medicine, to the inflammation segment.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., or collectively Dr. Reddy's, who intends to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. The cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Dr. Reddy's advising that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of VIMOVO before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. On July 30, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied our request for a rehearing of the Court's invalidity ruling against the 6,926,907 and 8,557,285 patents for VIMOVO coordinated-release tablets. As a result, the District Court entered judgment in September 2019 invalidating the \u2018907 and \u2018285 patents, which ended any restriction against the FDA from granting final approval to Dr. Reddy's generic version of VIMOVO. On February 18, 2020, the FDA granted final approval for Dr. Reddy's generic version of VIMOVO. We anticipate that Dr. Reddy's will immediately launch its product at-risk notwithstanding the ongoing patent litigation. Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Ajanta Pharma LTD, or Ajanta, intending to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. If we are unsuccessful in any of the VIMOVO cases, we will likely face generic competition with respect to VIMOVO and sales of VIMOVO will be substantially harmed.\nWe market all of our medicines in the United States through our field sales forces, which numbered approximately 480 representatives as of December 31, 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nConsolidated Results\n\nNet sales. Net sales increased $92.4 million, or 8%, to $1,300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1,207.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net sales in our orphan and rheumatology segment of $98.1 million, offset by a decrease in net sales in our inflammation segment of $5.7 million.\nThe following table presents a summary of total net sales attributed to geographic sources for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nThe following table reflects the components of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nKRYSTEXXA. Net sales increased $83.5 million, or 32%, to $342.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $258.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales increased by approximately $73.9 million due to volume growth and approximately $9.6 million due to higher net pricing.\nRAVICTI. Net sales increased $2.1 million, or 1%, to $228.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $226.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales in the United States increased by approximately $5.2 million, which was composed of an increase of approximately $21.9 million due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $16.7 million resulting from lower net pricing. Net sales outside the United States decreased by approximately $3.1 million as a result of the Immedica transaction on December 28, 2018.\nPROCYSBI. Net sales increased $7.0 million, or 5%, to $161.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $154.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net sales was composed of an increase of approximately $9.0 million due to volume growth, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million resulting from lower net pricing.\nACTIMMUNE. Net sales increased $1.7 million, or 2%, to $107.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $105.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales increased by approximately $4.2 million due to higher net pricing, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2.5 million resulting from lower sales volume.\nRAYOS. Net sales increased $17.5 million, or 29%, to $78.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $61.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales increased by approximately $29.9 million resulting from higher net pricing primarily due to lower utilization of our patient assistance programs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $12.4 million due to lower sales volume.\nBUPHENYL. Net sales decreased $12.0 million, or 55%, to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $21.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales decreased primarily as a result of the Immedica transaction in December 2018.\nLODOTRA. Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. Effective January 1, 2019, we ceased recording LODOTRA net sales.\nInflammation\nPENNSAID 2%. Net sales increased $10.6 million, or 6%, to $200.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $190.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales increased by approximately $47.2 million resulting from higher net pricing primarily due to lower utilization of our patient assistance programs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $36.6 million resulting from lower sales volume.\nDUEXIS. Net sales increased $1.1 million, or 1%, to $115.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales increased by approximately $18.1 million resulting from higher net pricing primarily due to lower utilization of our patient assistance programs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $17.0 million resulting from lower sales volume.\nVIMOVO. Net sales decreased $15.5 million, or 23%, to $52.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $67.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales decreased by approximately $17.8 million due to lower sales volume, partially offset by an increase of approximately $2.3 million resulting from higher net pricing primarily due to lower utilization of our patient assistance programs.\nMIGERGOT. Net sales decreased $1.8 million, or 49%, to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. On June 28, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT.\nThe table below reconciles our gross to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions, except percentages):\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, co-pay and other patient assistance costs, as a percentage of gross sales, decreased to 38.8% from 46.2% during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower utilization of our patient assistance programs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, government rebates and chargebacks, as a percentage of gross sales, increased to 13.2% from 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of an increased proportion of orphan and rheumatology medicines sold. Government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of gross sales are typically higher for medicines in the orphan and rheumatology segment compared to medicines in the inflammation segment.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patients' medical insurance deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual medical insurance deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased $29.1 million to $362.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $391.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 28% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a $17.0 million decrease in inventory step-up expense.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in inventory step-up expense of $17.0 million recorded to cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily related to KRYSTEXXA, inventory step-up being fully expensed by March 31, 2018, resulting in no significant inventory step-up expense being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $20.4 million to $103.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $82.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to total upfront and progress payments of $6.0 million incurred under our collaboration agreement with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC, or HemoShear, and a milestone payment of $3.0 million made to Roche relating to the TEPEZZA BLA submission to the FDA. In addition, employee-related costs increased by $6.5 million, TEPEZZA-related external costs increased by $3.3 million and KRYSTEXXA-related external costs increased by $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million to $697.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $692.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee costs of $17.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $14.0 million in legal fees and litigation settlements.\nLoss (Gain) on sale of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGERGOT for cash proceeds of $6.0 million, and we recorded a loss of $11.0 million on the sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan for cash proceeds of $35.0 million, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million on the sale. Additionally, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a potential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale. The contingent consideration payment of \u20ac3.0 million ($3.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at the date of receipt of 1.0991) was received in September 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due primarily to lower anticipated future net sales based on a Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, review. We also recorded an impairment of $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to LODOTRA as result of amendments to our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased $34.6 million to $87.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $121.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in debt interest expense of $27.9 million, primarily related to the decrease in the principal amount of our term loans, repayment of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, in May 2019 and in August 2019, repayment of our 8.750% Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Senior Notes, and an increase in interest income of $6.5 million.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $58.8 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the early redemption premiums and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the prepayment of $775.0 million of our 2023 Senior Notes and our 2024 Senior Notes, and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the $400.0 million of term loan repayments.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $593.2 million compared to $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The benefit for income taxes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $553.3 million deferred tax asset resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary.\nInformation by Segment\nSee Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of our segment operating income to our total loss before benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nThe following table reflects our orphan and rheumatology net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages).\n\nThe increase in orphan and rheumatology net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Orphan and rheumatology segment operating income increased $16.3 million to $306.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $290.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of $98.1 million as described above, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $69.4 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in costs to prepare for the U.S. launch of TEPEZZA.\nInflammation\nThe following table reflects our inflammation net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages).\n\n \nThe decrease in inflammation net sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Inflammation segment operating income increased $14.4 million to $174.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $160.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $18.6 million offset by a decrease in net sales of $5.7 million as described above. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to lower sample and patient assistance program administration expenses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\n\n \nNet sales. Net sales increased $151.3 million, or 14.3%, to $1,207.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $1,056.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to higher net sales in our orphan and rheumatology segment.\nThe following table presents a summary of total net sales attributed to geographic sources for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nThe following table reflects the components of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nKRYSTEXXA. Net sales increased $102.4 million, or 65%, to $258.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $156.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales increased by approximately $108.5 million resulting from volume growth, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $6.1 million due to lower net pricing.\nRAVICTI. Net sales increased $32.7 million, or 17%, to $226.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $193.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales in the United States increased by approximately $30.8 million, which was composed of an increase of $24.4 million due to higher net pricing and $6.4 million due to volume growth. Net sales outside the United States increased by approximately $1.9 million primarily due to higher sales volume. On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI outside of North America and Japan to Immedica.\nPROCYSBI. Net sales increased $17.2 million, or 12%, to $154.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $137.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales in the United States increased by approximately $22.7 million, which was composed of $15.6 million due to higher net pricing and $7.1 million resulting from volume growth. Net sales outside the United States decreased by approximately $5.5 million primarily as a result of the Chiesi divestiture in June 2017.\nACTIMMUNE. Net sales decreased $5.4 million, or 5%, to $105.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $111.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales decreased by approximately $11.2 million resulting from lower volume, partially offset by an increase of approximately $5.8 million due to higher net pricing.\nRAYOS. Net sales increased $8.9 million, or 17%, to $61.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $52.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales increased by approximately $5.0 million resulting from volume growth and approximately $3.9 million due to higher net pricing.\nBUPHENYL. Net sales increased $1.0 million, or 5%, to $21.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $20.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales increased by approximately $2.0 million due to volume growth, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $1.0 million resulting from lower net pricing. On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Immedica.\nLODOTRA. Net sales decreased $3.3 million, or 62%, to $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to decreased shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occurred at the time we shipped, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales were not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and could therefore fluctuate significantly from period to period. Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019. See Manufacturing, Commercial, Supply and License Agreements\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the amendments.\nQUINSAIR. Net sales decreased $2.9 million, or 85%, to $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to lower volume following the Chiesi divestiture.\nInflammation\nPENNSAID 2%. Net sales decreased $0.8 million to $190.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $191.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales decreased by approximately $12.1 million due to lower volume, partially offset by an increase of approximately $11.3 million due to higher net pricing.\nDUEXIS. Net sales decreased $6.5 million, or 5%, to $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $121.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales decreased by approximately $6.4 million due to lower volume and approximately $0.1 million due to lower net pricing.\nVIMOVO. Net sales increased $10.0 million, or 17%, to $67.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $57.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales increased by approximately $23.2 million due to higher net pricing, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $13.2 million resulting from lower volume.\nMIGERGOT. Net sales decreased $1.9 million, or 35%, to $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales decreased by approximately $1.6 million due to lower volume and approximately $0.3 million due to lower net pricing. On June 28, 2019, we sold our rights to MIGEROT.\nThe table below reconciles our gross to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except percentages):\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, commercial rebates and wholesaler fees, as a percentage of gross sales, decreased to 13.8% from 15.8% during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a change in the mix of medicines sold and lower rates paid to distributors during 2018 compared to 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, government rebates and chargebacks, as a percentage of gross sales, increased to 9.3% from 8.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a change in the mix of medicines sold.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patients' medical insurance deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual medical insurance deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2019, the 340B ceiling price rule became effective. With respect to KRYSTEXXA, the additional rebate\u201d scheme of the 340B pricing program, as applied to the historical pricing of KRYSTEXXA both before and after we acquired the medicine, have resulted in a 340B ceiling price of one penny. A material portion of KRYSTEXXA prescriptions (approximately 20 percent) are written by healthcare providers that are eligible for 340B drug pricing and therefore the reduction in 340B pricing to a penny has negatively impacted our net sales from KRYSTEXXA.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased $102.1 million to $391.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $493.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 47% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a $101.8 million decrease in inventory step-up expense.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in inventory step-up expense of $101.8 million recorded to cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily related to KRYSTEXXA, PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up expense. KRYSTEXXA inventory step-up expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $17.0 million compared to $78.3 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.3 million compared to $40.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $142.2 million to $82.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $225.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to $150.3 million related to the acquisition of River Vision during the year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, as amended by ASU No. 2017-01, we accounted for the River Vision acquisition as the purchase of an in-process research and development, or IPR&D, asset and, pursuant to ASC 730, Research and Development, or ASC 730, recorded the purchase as a research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement to license HZN-003, a rheumatology pipeline program with the objective of enhancing our leadership position in the uncontrolled gout market, from MedImmune LLC, or MedImmune, and we paid MedImmune an upfront cash payment of $12.0 million which we recorded as a research and development\u201d expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017 and included in accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2017. The upfront payment was subsequently paid in January 2018. Excluding the costs attributable to the acquisition of River Vision and HZN-003, research and development expenses increased by $20.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the costs associated with the development of TEPEZZA.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37.4 million to $692.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $655.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our KRYSTEXXA sales force that was initiated during the second half of 2017 and other activities to support the growth in sales of the medicine, and pre-launch costs for TEPEZZA.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due primarily to lower anticipated future net sales based on a Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, review. We also recorded an impairment of $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to LODOTRA as result of amendments to our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed. These transfer activities are ongoing. We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019. Impairment of long-lived assets of $22.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, represents the impairment of a non-current asset recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was previously included within selling, general and administrative\u201d expenses. On July 24, 2018, we completed the IMUKIN sale as further described in the next paragraph.\nGain on sale of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan for cash proceeds of $35.0 million, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million on the sale. Additionally, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a potential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased $4.8 million to $121.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $126.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $8.5 million primarily due to higher cash balances, partially offset by an increase of $3.7 million in interest expense.\nGain on divestiture. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the Chiesi divestiture for an upfront payment of $72.5 million, which reflects $3.1 million of cash divested, with additional potential milestone payments based on sales thresholds, and we recorded a gain of $8.0 million on the divestiture.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $44.8 million compared to $108.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The reduction in benefit for income taxes of $63.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax losses and the tax rate at which some of these reduced losses were tax effected resulting in a tax provision of $57.9 million and income tax expense of $45.8 million generated on an intra-company transfer of assets other than inventory during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of $84.0 million net benefit following the enactment in the United States of H.R. 1, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, in December 2017, which net benefit included a $143.3 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liability based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the write-off of the $59.2 million deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the date of enactment for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, we reflected the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete. To the extent that our accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act was incomplete but it was possible to determine a reasonable estimate, we recorded a provisional estimate in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017.\nOn April 2, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2018-28, or the Notice, which provided guidance for computing the business interest expense limitation under the Tax Act and clarified the treatment of interest disallowed and carried forward under Section 163(j) of the Code prior to enactment of the Tax Act. In accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118 and the guidance in the Notice we reinstated the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. The impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118 during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a $37.4 million increase to our benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. We had no other material measurement period adjustments under SAB 118.\nThe remainder of the decrease in benefit for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a tax provision of $8.1 million attributable to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to an increase in U.S. state effective tax rates attributable to the enactment of certain U.S. state legislation during the year ended December 31, 2018. These decreases to the benefit for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018 were partially offset by an income tax expense of $51.1 million on non-deductible research and development costs which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and did not re-occur for the year ended December 31, 2018, a tax benefit of $42.7 million U.S. federal tax and $7.9 million U.S. state tax benefit on the liquidation of a foreign partnership owned by us during the year ended December 31, 2018 and decreases to our current state income tax expense of $6.8 million resulting from current year pre-tax losses incurred in the U.S. group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the first of three tranches of our outstanding performance stock unit awards, or PSUs, issued in 2015 expired without payout as the minimum total compounded annual shareholder rate of return was not achieved. As a result, we wrote off to income tax expense $16.4 million of deferred tax assets related to previously recognized share-based compensation.\nIn relation to our outstanding PSUs at December 31, 2017, as our share price was lower than $32.70 for the twenty trading days ended March 22, 2018, and lower than $33.86 for the twenty trading days ended June 22, 2018, the second two tranches of PSU awards granted in 2015 expired without payment as the minimum total compounded annual shareholder rate of return was not achieved, and approximately $10.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, related to previously recognized share-based compensation expense was charged to income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInformation by Segment\nSee Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of our segment operating income to our total loss before benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOrphan and Rheumatology\nThe following table reflects our orphan and rheumatology net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\n\nThe increase in orphan and rheumatology net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Orphan and rheumatology segment operating income increased $48.9 million to $290.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $241.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of $150.6 million as described above, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $68.2 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $17.6 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the expansion of our KRYSTEXXA sales force that was initiated during the second half of 2017 and other activities to support the growth in sales of the medicine, and pre-launch costs for TEPEZZA. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the development of TEPEZZA.\nInflammation\nThe following table reflects our inflammation net sales and segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\n\n \nThe increase in inflammation net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018, is described in the Consolidated Results section above.\nSegment operating income. Inflammation segment operating income increased $11.3 million to $160.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $149.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to stability in net sales and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $10.7 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are used and provided by us as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information on our performance, operations and profitability. Adjustments to our GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition/divestiture-related costs, upfront, progress and milestone payments related to license and collaboration agreements, drug substance harmonization costs, fees related to refinancing activities, restructuring and realignment costs, litigation settlements and charges related to discontinuation of the Friedreich's ataxia program, or the FA discontinuation, loss (gain) on sale of assets, loss on debt extinguishments, the income tax effect on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and other non-GAAP income tax adjustments, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, inventory step-up expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, long-lived assets impairment charges, and other non-cash adjustments. Certain other special items or substantive events may also be included in the non-GAAP adjustments periodically when their magnitude is significant within the periods incurred. We maintain an established non-GAAP cost policy that guides the determination of what costs will be excluded in non-GAAP measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP figures, can enhance an overall understanding of our financial and operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are included with the intent of providing investors with a more complete understanding of our historical financial results and trends and to facilitate comparisons between periods. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators our management uses for planning and forecasting purposes and measuring our performance. For example, adjusted EBITDA is used by us as one measure of management performance under certain incentive compensation arrangements. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nReconciliations of reported GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, and the related per share amounts, were as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\n\n\n (1) Represents depreciation expense related to our property, equipment, software and leasehold improvements. \n (2) Intangible amortization expenses are associated with our intellectual property rights, developed technology and customer relationships related to KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, RAYOS, BUPHENYL, LODOTRA, PENNSAID 2%, VIMOVO and MIGERGOT. \n (3) During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized in cost of goods sold $17.3 million for inventory step-up expense primarily related to KRYSTEXXA inventory sold. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized in cost of goods sold $78.3 million for inventory step-up expense related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT inventory sold and $40.8 million for inventory step-up expense related to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory sold.\n (4) Represents share-based compensation expense associated with our stock option, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants to our employees and non-employee directors and our employee share purchase plan. \n (5) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $58.8 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the early redemption premiums and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the prepayment of $775.0 million of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and debt discount fees related to the $400.0 million of term loan repayments. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into two refinancing amendments for our term loans. We accounted for a portion of the repayments under these refinancing amendments as a debt extinguishment and recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $1.0 million in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), which reflected the write-off of the unamortized portion of debt discount and deferred financing costs previously incurred and a 1 percent prepayment penalty fee.\n (6) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss of $11.0 million on the sale of our rights to MIGERGOT. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the IMUKIN sale for cash proceeds of $9.5 million, with a\npotential additional contingent consideration payment and we recorded a gain of $12.3 million on the sale. The\ncontingent consideration payment of \u20ac3.0 million ($3.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at the date of receipt of 1.0991) was received in September 2019. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Medical Need Europe AB, and we recorded a gain of $30.7 million.\n (7) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an upfront, progress and milestone payments related to license and collaboration agreements of $9.1 million which was composed of a $3.0 million milestone payment to Roche relating to the TEPEZZA BLA submission to the FDA during the third quarter of 2019, and an upfront cash payment of $2.0 million and a progress payment of $4.0 million in relation to the collaboration agreement with HemoShear. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $12.2 million of upfront and milestone payments related to license agreements, primarily related to our agreement to license HZN-003 (formerly MEDI4945), a rheumatology pipeline program with the objective of enhancing our leadership position in the uncontrolled gout market, from MedImmune for an upfront cash payment of $12.0 million.\n (8) Represents expenses, including legal and consulting fees, incurred in connection with our acquisitions and divestitures. Costs recovered from subleases of acquired facilities and reimbursed expenses incurred under transition arrangements for divestitures are also reflected in this line-item. \n (9) Represents arrangement and other fees relating to our refinancing activities. \n (10) During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded charges related to the FA discontinuation of $1.1 million, primarily due to the remeasurement of an inventory purchase commitment liability. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a reduction to previously incurred charges relating to the FA discontinuation of $1.5 million reflecting lower costs to discontinue the clinical trial than previously anticipated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded charges relating to the FA discontinuation of $0.2 million.\n (11) We recorded $1.0 million and $5.8 million of expense during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for litigation settlements. \n (12) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, marketed as IMUKIN in an estimated thirty countries primarily in Europe and the Middle East, or the IMUKIN purchase agreement. We already owned the rights to interferon gamma-1b marketed as ACTIMMUNE in the United States, Canada and Japan. In connection with the IMUKIN purchase agreement, we also committed to pay our contract manufacturer certain amounts related to the harmonization of the manufacturing processes for ACTIMMUNE and IMUKIN drug substance, or the harmonization program. At the time we entered into the IMUKIN purchase agreement and the harmonization program commitment was made, we had anticipated achieving certain benefits should the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA be successful. If the study had been successful and if U.S. marketing approval had subsequently been obtained, we had forecasted significant increases in demand for the medicine and the harmonization program would have resulted in significant benefits for us. Following our discontinuation of the FA program, we determined that certain assets, including an upfront payment related to the IMUKIN purchase agreement, were impaired, and the costs under the harmonization program would no longer have benefit to us and should be expensed as incurred. \n (13) Represents expenses, including severance costs and consulting fees, related to restructuring and realignment activities. \n (14) Impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily relates to the write-off of the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America and LODOTRA. \nImpairment of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $22.3 million relates to an impairment recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was presented in the charges relating to the discontinuation of the Friedreich's ataxia program\u201d line item in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n (15) During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the divestiture of a European subsidiary that owns the marketing rights to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR in EMEA to Chiesi and in connection with this divestiture we recorded a gain of $8.0 million. \n (16) Represents amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with our debt. \n (17) Income tax adjustments on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments represent the estimated income tax impact of each pre-tax \nnon-GAAP adjustment based on the statutory income tax rate of the applicable jurisdictions for each non-GAAP adjustment.\n (18) Other non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflect a tax benefit of $553.3 million resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary. \nOther non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflect the impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118, which was a $37.4 million increase to our benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. Following Notice 2018-28 that was issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service during the year ended December 31, 2018 and in accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118, we reinstated the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carry forwards under Section 163(j) of the Code based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent.\nOther non-GAAP income tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflect the provisional $84.0 million net benefit recorded following the enactment of the Tax Act, which net benefit included a $143.3 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liability based on the revised U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the write-off of the $59.2 million deferred tax asset related to our U.S. interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Code.\nLiquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses in most fiscal years since our inception in June 2005 and, as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $605.7 million. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as a result of the commercialization of our medicines, including as a result of the commercial launch of TEPEZZA, but we believe these cost increases will be more than offset by higher net sales and gross profits. Additionally, we expect that our research and development costs will increase as we acquire or develop more development-stage medicine candidates and advance our candidates through the clinical development and regulatory approval processes.\nIn February 2020, we purchased a three-building campus in Deerfield, Illinois, for total cash consideration of $115.0 million. The Deerfield campus totals 70 acres and consists of more than 650,000 square feet of office space. We expect to move to the Deerfield campus in the second half of 2020 and market our Lake Forest office for sub-lease. We expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2020 in order to prepare the Deerfield campus for occupancy.\nAs a result of the FDA approval of TEPEZZA in January 2020, we will make a milestone payment of $100.0 million under the agreement for the acquisition of River Vision during the first quarter of 2020.\nWe have financed our operations to date through equity financings, debt financings and the issuance of convertible notes, along with cash flows from operations during the last several years. During 2019, we reduced the principal amount of our total debt outstanding by $575.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,080.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt with a book value of $1,352.8 million and principal amount of $1,418.0 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our business needs for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Part of our strategy is to expand and leverage our commercial capabilities and to develop a pipeline of rare disease medicine candidates by researching, developing and commercializing innovative medicines that address unmet treatment needs for rare and rheumatic diseases. To the extent we enter into transactions to acquire medicines or businesses in the future, we may need to finance a significant portion of those acquisitions through additional debt, equity or convertible debt financings, or through the use of cash on hand.\nEquity Issuances\nOn March 11, 2019, we closed an underwritten public equity offering of 14.1 million ordinary shares at a price to the public of $24.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $326.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1.8 million additional ordinary shares.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued an aggregate of 5.1 million of our ordinary shares in connection with stock option exercises, the vesting of restricted stock units and performance stock units, and employee share purchase plan purchases. We received a total of $36.2 million in proceeds in connection with such issuances.\nAmendments to Credit Agreement, Debt Repayments and 2027 Senior Notes\nOn March 11, 2019, Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc. (formerly known as Horizon Pharma USA, Inc.), our wholly owned subsidiary, or HTUSA, received $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, or the Incremental Revolving Commitments, pursuant to an amendment to our credit agreement, dated as of May 7, 2015, with Citibank, N.A., as amended, or the Credit Agreement. The Incremental Revolving Commitments were established pursuant to an incremental facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and will provide HTUSA with $200.0 million of additional borrowing capacity, which includes a $50.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Incremental Revolving Commitments will terminate in March 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.\nOn March 18, 2019, HTUSA completed the repayment of $300.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement.\nOn April 1, 2019, we delivered a notice of partial optional redemption of $250.0 million of the 2023 Senior Notes to the trustee under the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes and the holders of the 2023 Senior Notes, which were redeemed on May 1, 2019. In connection with this early redemption, we paid a premium of $8.3 million on May 1, 2019.\nOn May 22, 2019, HTUSA borrowed approximately $518.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, or the May 2019 Refinancing Loans, pursuant to an amendment to our Credit Agreement. HTUSA used the proceeds of the May 2019 Refinancing Loans to repay the outstanding amounts under our prior term loans, which totaled approximately $518.0 million.\nOn July 16, 2019, HTUSA completed a private placement of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes, to several investment banks acting as initial purchasers, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, who subsequently resold the 2027 Senior Notes to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to certain non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nWe used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 Senior Notes, together with approximately $65.0 million in cash on hand, to redeem or prepay $625.0 million of our outstanding debt, consisting of (i) the outstanding $225.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes, (ii) the outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of our 2024 Senior Notes and (iii) $100.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of senior secured term loans under the Credit Agreement, as well as to pay the related premiums and fees and expenses, excluding accrued interest, associated with such redemption and prepayment.\nOn December 18, 2019, HTUSA borrowed approximately $418.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, or the December 2019 Refinancing Loans, pursuant to an amendment to our Credit Agreement. HTUSA used the proceeds of the December 2019 Refinancing Loans to repay the outstanding amounts under our prior term loans, which totaled approximately $418.0 million.\nFollowing these transactions, our total aggregate outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $1,418.0 million, a decrease of $575.0 million from $1,993.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nFor a more detailed description of our debt agreements, see Note 13, Debt Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis. This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, including borrowing additional funds; increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and placing us at a disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIn addition, the indenture governing our 2027 Senior Notes and our Credit Agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay junior debt and make certain investments, incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock, incur liens on assets, engage in certain asset sales or merger transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash position and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $426.3 million, $194.5 million and $284.3 million, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to cash collections from gross sales, partially offset by payments made related to patient assistance programs and commercial rebates for our inflammation segment medicines, and payments related to selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Operating cash flow was also used to fund interest on outstanding debt of $78.0 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales, net of operating expenses. Operating cash flow was also used to fund interest on outstanding debt of $112.5 million and income taxes of $53.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2017 by cash payments of $113.8 million for interest, $32.5 million outlay for the remaining 50 percent of the litigation settlement amount with Express Scripts, cash payments of $54.0 million for acquisition/divestiture-related costs, cash payments relating to term loan refinancing of $9.1 million, cash payments related to the discontinuation of the FA program of $7.2 million, cash payments relating to our drug substance harmonization program of $5.2 million and cash payments related to our restructuring and realignment activities of $4.7 million.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $17.9 million and $102.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $27.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the purchases of property and equipment of $17.9 million and an escrow deposit payment of $6.0 million related to the purchase of the Deerfield campus, partially offset by proceeds from the MIGERGOT transaction of $6.0 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of assets during the year, including cash proceeds of $35.0 million following the sale of rights to RAVICTI and AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Immedica and cash proceeds of $9.5 million following the IMUKIN sale. This was partially offset by $12.0 million we paid to MedImmune to license HZN-003 (formerly MEDI4945).\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily associated with $144.9 million of payments for the acquisition of River Vision, net of cash acquired, and associated transaction costs, and $22.3 million relating to the payment for certain rights for interferon gamma-1b. This was partially offset by $69.4 million of proceeds received from the Chiesi divestiture, net of cash divested.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $290.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $54.3 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the net repayment of $400.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement, the repayment of the outstanding principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes of $775.0 million and related early redemption premiums of $39.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our 2027 Senior Notes of $590.1 million and net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares of $326.8 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to the repayment of term loans of $845.7 million, partially offset by $818.0 million in net proceeds from term loans. In June 2018, we made a mandatory prepayment of $23.5 million under our term loan facility. In October 2018, we refinanced our term loans without changing the principal amount outstanding.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $1,693.5 million from term loans, offset in part by repayment of term loans of $1,622.8 million. We refinanced our term loans during March 2017 and October 2017. The March 2017 refinancing loans replaced the $394.0 million 2015 term loan facility and the $375.0 million 2016 incremental loan facility and the October 2017 refinancing loans replaced the October 2017 refinanced loans. The March 2017 amendment to the Credit Agreement resulted in an increase of $81.0 million of principal amount of our outstanding debt and the October 2017 refinancing loans did not result in any changes to the principal amount outstanding. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $20.0 million relating to milestones in connection with a contingent consideration liability assumed in our acquisition of Raptor.\nFinancial Condition as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nAccounts receivable, net. Accounts receivable, net, decreased $56.0 million, from $464.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $408.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower gross sales of our medicines during the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $75.4 million, from $68.2 million as of December 31, 2018 to $143.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advance payments for inventory of $29.8 million, an increase in deferred charge for taxes on intra-company profits of $24.7 million and an increase in prepaid income taxes of $6.7 million.\nDeveloped technology, net. Developed technology, net, decreased $246.8 million, from $1,945.6 million as of December 31, 2018 to $1,698.8 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the amortization of developed technology of $230.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the recording of a reduction in the net book value of $17.0 million related to the MIGERGOT transaction.\nDeferred Tax Assets, net. Deferred tax assets, net, increased $552.0 million from $3.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $555.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $553.3 million deferred tax asset resulting from an intra-company transfer of intellectual property assets to an Irish subsidiary.\nOther assets. Other assets increased $39.3 million, from $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018 to $48.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU No. 2016-02, on January 1, 2019, we established $38.0 million of liabilities and corresponding lease assets of $36.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet for leases, primarily related to operating leases on rented office properties, that existed as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date.\nAccrued expenses. Accrued expenses increased $19.5 million, from $215.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $235.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase in allowance for returns of $6.0 million, payroll-related expenses of $6.0 million and accrued interest of $5.5 million.\nAccrued trade discounts and rebates. Accrued trade discounts and rebates increased $8.6 million, from $457.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $466.4 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in accrued government rebates and chargebacks offset by a $15.8 million decrease in co-pay and other patient assistance costs and a $14.8 million decrease in accrued commercial rebates and wholesaler fees.\nLong-term debt, net of current. Long-term debt, net of current decreased $563.2 million from $1,564.5 million as of December 31, 2018 to $1,001.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily related to the repayment of $400.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of our term loans and the repayment of our 2023 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes. See Note 13, Debt Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\nDeferred tax liabilities, net. Deferred tax liabilities, net, decreased $13.6 million, from $107.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $94.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the U.S. federal and state tax credits generated during 2019 of $10.5 million and the decrease in state effective tax rate on the U.S. group net deferred tax liabilities of $1.5 million.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities increased $41.6 million, from $38.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $80.3 million as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to $46.5 million related to long-term lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we established $38.0 million of liabilities and corresponding lease assets of $36.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet for leases, primarily related to operating leases on rented office properties, that existed as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, minimum future cash payments due under contractual obligations, including, among others, our debt agreements, purchase agreements with third-party manufacturers and non-cancelable operating lease agreements, were as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Represents the minimum contractual obligation due under the following debt agreements: \n \u2022 $418.0 million under the December 2019 Refinancing Loans, which includes estimated monthly interest payments based on the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2019 of 3.94% and repayment of the remaining principal in May 2026. In June 2018, we repaid $23.5 million under the mandatory prepayment provisions of the Credit Agreement. In March 2019, we completed the repayment of $300.0 million of our outstanding principal amount of term loans under the Credit Agreement following the closing of our underwritten public equity offering. In July 2019, we repaid an additional $100.0 million of our term loans under the Credit Agreement. Following these repayments, our outstanding principal balance of term loans under the Credit Agreement was $418.0 million and we are not required to pay any further quarterly installments. \n \u2022 $600.0 million 2027 Senior Notes, which includes bi-annual interest payments and repayment of the principal in August 2027. \n \u2022 $400.0 million Exchangeable Senior Notes, which includes bi-annual interest payments and repayment of the principal in March 2022. \n (2) These amounts reflect the following purchase commitments with our third-party manufacturers: \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for TEPEZZA drugs substance with AGC Biologics A/S to be delivered through the second half of 2021. Purchase commitments with Catalent Indiana, LLC for TEPEZZA drug product to be delivered through December 2020. \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for PROCYSBI through March 2020. \n \u2022 Minimum annual order quantities required to be placed with Boehringer Ingelheim for final packaged ACTIMMUNE through July 2024 and additional units we also committed to purchase which were intended to cover anticipated demand if the results of the FA program of ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA had been successful. As of December 31, 2019, the minimum binding purchase commitment to Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals, was $15.6 million (converted using a Dollar-to-Euro exchange rate of 1.1215) through July 2024. \n \u2022 A commitment to spend $0.7 million with Boehringer Ingelheim related to the harmonization of the manufacturing process for ACTIMMUNE drug substance. \n \u2022 Minimum purchase commitment for KRYSTEXXA through 2026. \n \u2022 Minimum purchase commitment for RAYOS tablets from Jagotec AG through December 2023. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2019, the minimum purchase commitment based on tablet pricing in effect under the agreement was $2.0 million through March 2020. Purchase commitment for final packaged PENNSAID 2% from Nuvo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (formerly known as Nuvo Research Inc.) through March 2020. \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for final packaged DUEXIS tablets from Sanofi-Aventis U.S. through June 2020. \n \u2022 Purchase commitment for RAVICTI, BUPHENYL and QUINSAIR outstanding at December 31, 2019. \n (3) These amounts reflect payments due under our operating leases, which are principally for our facilities. For further details regarding these properties, see Item 2 of Part I, Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe above table does not include details of an agreement to lease entered into on October 14, 2019, relating to approximately 63,000 square feet of office space under construction in Dublin, Ireland. Lease commencement will begin when construction of the offices are completed by the lessor and we have access to begin the construction of leasehold improvements. We expect to incur leasehold improvement costs during 2020 and 2021 in order to prepare the building for occupancy.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contingent liability for uncertain tax positions amounted to $27.4 million (excluding interest and penalties). Due to the nature and timing of the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any. Therefore, our contingent liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.\nIn addition to the obligations set out in the above table, we have assumed material obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to certain third parties on net sales of certain of our medicines. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details of these material obligations.\nIn February 2020, we purchased a three-building campus in Deerfield, Illinois, for total cash consideration of $115.0 million. The Deerfield campus totals 70 acres and consists of more than 650,000 square feet of office space. We expect to move to the Deerfield campus in the second half of 2020 and market our Lake Forest office for sub-lease. We expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2020 in order to prepare the Deerfield campus for occupancy.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, other than the indemnification agreements discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should also be read in conjunction with Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the United States, we sell our medicines primarily to wholesale distributors, specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers. In other countries, we sell our medicines primarily to wholesale distributors and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our medicines to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government-mandated or privately negotiated discounts and allowances related to our medicines. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer medicines. Accordingly, revenues from medicine sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our medicines, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring medicines and is generally based upon a list or fixed price less allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts. We sell our medicines to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies under agreements with payment terms typically less than 90 days. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components does not differ materially from our historical practices.\nMedicine Sales Discounts and Allowances\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to variable consideration because of allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts. Allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts are recorded at the time of sale to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies. We apply significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances. If actual results differ from our estimates, we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future. Our adjustments to gross sales are discussed further below.\nCommercial Rebates\nWe participate in certain commercial rebate programs. Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the commercial entity or third-party administrator of the program. We calculate accrued commercial rebate estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated rebates based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the rebate as a reduction of revenue. Accrued commercial rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nCo-pay and Other Patient Assistance Programs\nWe offer discount card and other programs such as our HorizonCares program to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. We reimburse pharmacies for this discount through third-party vendors. We reduce gross sales by the amount of actual co-pay and other patient assistance in the period based on invoices received. We also record an accrual to reduce gross sales for estimated co-pay and other patient assistance on units sold to distributors that have not yet been prescribed/dispensed to a patient. We calculate accrued co-pay and other patient assistance costs using the expected value method. The estimate is based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients, average assistance paid based on reporting from the third-party vendors and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Accrued co-pay and other patient assistance costs are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nSales Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return certain medicines within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the medicine expiration date. Generally, medicines may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date and up to one year after its expiration date. The right of return expires on the earlier of one year after the medicine expiration date or the time that the medicine is dispensed to the patient. The majority of medicine returns result from medicine dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. We calculate sales returns using the expected value method. The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns. The return period is known to us based on the shelf life of medicines at the time of shipment. We record sales returns in accrued expenses\u201d and as a reduction of revenue.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe participate in certain government rebate programs such as Medicare Coverage Gap and Medicaid. We calculate accrued government rebate estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated rebates based on percentages of medicine prescribed to qualified patients, estimated rebate percentages and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel that will be prescribed to qualified patients and record the rebates as a reduction of revenue. Accrued government rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nChargebacks\nWe provide discounts to government qualified entities with whom we have contracted. These entities purchase medicines from the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors at a discounted price and the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the contracted price that the entities paid for the medicines. We calculate accrued chargeback estimates using the expected value method. We accrue estimated chargebacks based on contract prices, sell-through sales data obtained from third-party information and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the chargeback as a reduction of revenue. Accrued chargebacks are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We review our intangible assets when events or circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable and exceeds their fair value. We measure fair value based on the estimated future discounted cash flows associated with our assets in addition to other assumptions and projections that we deem to be reasonable and supportable. The estimated useful lives, from the date of acquisition, for all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization are between five and thirteen years.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized based on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If we conclude that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Under this method, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which a deferred tax asset can be utilized. In determining future taxable income, we are required to make assumptions including the amount of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These assumptions require significant judgment about forecasts of future taxable income. Actual operating results in future years could render our current assumption of recoverability of deferred tax assets inaccurate. The impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that the change is enacted. From time to time, we execute intra-company transactions in response to changes in operations, regulations, tax laws, funding needs and other circumstances. These transactions require the interpretation and application of tax laws in the applicable jurisdiction to support the tax treatment taken. The valuations which support the tax treatment of the transactions require significant estimates and assumptions within discounted cash flow models. We also account for the uncertainty in income taxes by utilizing a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on an income tax return. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted by each tax-paying entity within each jurisdiction in our consolidated balance sheets.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for employee share-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based payments based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each awardee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. If an award includes both a service condition and a market or performance condition, the graded vesting method is used to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods. We adopted ASU No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 and elected to retain a forfeiture rate after adoption.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Impacting Critical Accounting Policies\nRefer to Note 2 in the
