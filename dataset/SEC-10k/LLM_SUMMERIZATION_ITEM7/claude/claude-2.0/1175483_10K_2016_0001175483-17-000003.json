Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nDrive Shack Inc. is a leading owner and operator of golf-related leisure and entertainment businesses. Drive Shack Inc.'s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol DS.\u201d Drive Shack Inc. is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, or Fortress (the Manager\u201d).\nFor further information relating to Drive Shack Inc.'s business, see Item 1.

We have not accessed the capital markets since 2014, and rising interest rates or stock market volatility could impair our ability to raise equity capital on attractive terms.\nOur ability to generate income is dependent on, among other factors, our ability to raise capital and finance investments on favorable terms, deploy capital on a timely basis at attractive returns, and exit investments at favorable yields. Market conditions outside of our control, such as interest rates, credit spreads and stock market volatility affect these objectives in a variety of ways.\nTraditional Golf\nWith respect to our Traditional Golf business, trends in consumer discretionary spending as well as climate and weather patterns have a significant impact on the markets in which we operate. Traditional Golf is subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by significant reductions in golf activities as well as revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each year, due to shorter days and colder temperatures. Consequently, a significantly larger portion of our revenue from our Traditional Golf operations is earned in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In addition, severe weather patterns can also negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhile consumer spending in the Traditional Golf industry has generally been declining in recent years, we believe improving economic conditions and improvements in local housing markets has helped and will continue to help drive membership growth and increase the number of golf rounds played. In addition, we believe growth in related industries, including leisure entertainment, can positively impact our traditional golf business.\nDebt Investments\nDuring the year, both short-term and long-term interest rates remained at or near historical lows. We project short- and long-term rates to increase in the future, although the timing of any further increases is uncertain. We have investments in both floating and fixed rate securities and loans, which are affected by interest rates in different ways. We expect that the value of our floating rate assets would not be significantly affected by a change in interest rates (whether an increase or decrease), since the coupon tracks the movement in rates, while the value of fixed rate assets can be negatively affected by rising interest rates. However, in general, rising interest rates are usually indicative of a strengthening economic environment, which could reduce the credit risk of some of our investments. With respect to our fixed rate assets, we believe that the negative impact of rising interest rates could potentially be offset by the positive impact of reduced credit risk.\nCredit spreads also affect the value of our investments in debt securities and loans. Credit spreads decreased or \"tightened,\" marginally during 2015 and 2016, which had a minimal impact on the value of our portfolio. Credit spreads measure the yield relative to a specified benchmark that the market demands on securities and loans based on the credit risk of such assets. The value of our portfolio tends to increase when spreads tighten and to decrease when spreads widen. Credit spreads also affect the cost of financing, with widening spreads tending to increase the cost, and tightening spreads tending to reduce it.\nThe net interest spread of our portfolio of Debt Investments can be impacted by (i) the timing and extent of changes in the composition of our portfolio as a result of purchases and sales of assets or the repayment of debt, repurchase agreements and other\nbonds, the incurrence of new debt, (ii) the yields on new investments, which varies depending on the credit quality of the issuer, and (iii) changes in our estimates of the yields on securities acquired at a discount for credit quality. For instance, the net interest spread of our Debt Investments increases if we sell assets with lower yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale or refinancing) that has a higher interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio (assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio). Conversely, the net interest spread of our portfolio decreases if we sell assets with higher yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale) that has a lower interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio (again, assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio). Management continually monitors market conditions to opportunistically effect purchases and sales of debt investments.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our estimates are based on information available to management at the time of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the result of historical analysis, our understanding and experience of the Company's operations, our knowledge of the industry and market-participant data available to us.\nActual results have historically been in line with management's estimates and judgments used in applying each of the accounting policies described below and management periodically re-evaluates accounting estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates and materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company does not expect our assessments and assumptions below to materially change in the future.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments, estimates and assumptions.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, and only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe VIEs in which we have a significant interest include our CDOs. We do not have the power to direct the relevant activities of CDO V, as a result of an event of default which allows for us to be removed as collateral manager of this CDO and prevents us from purchasing or selling certain collateral within this CDO, and therefore this CDO is not consolidated as of December 31, 2016. In August 2016, the Company settled on a trade to sell $14.8 million face amount of two CDO V securities for total proceeds of $9.9 million (See Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information). As a result of this trade, the Company no longer has an economic interest in CDO V.\nOn March 31, 2016, Drive Shack Inc. sold $11.0 million face amount of NCT 2013-VI Class I-MM-2. As a result of this sale, the Company was no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated CDO VI.\nOur subprime securitizations are also considered VIEs, but we do not control the decisions that most significantly impact their economic performance and no longer receive a significant portion of their returns, and therefore do not consolidate them.\nIn addition, our investments in RMBS and real estate related and other loans may be deemed to be variable interests in VIEs, depending on their structure. We monitor these investments and analyze the potential need to consolidate the related securitization entities pursuant to the VIE consolidation requirements. These analyses require considerable judgment in determining whether an entity is a VIE and determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE since they involve subjective determinations of significance, with respect to both power and economics. The result could be the consolidation of an entity that otherwise would not have been consolidated or the deconsolidation of an entity that otherwise would have been consolidated.\nValuation of Securities\nWe have classified all of our real estate securities as available-for-sale. As such, they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, to the extent impairment losses are considered temporary as described below. Fair value may be based upon broker quotations, counterparty quotations or pricing services quotations, which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications or a good faith estimate thereof and are subject to significant variability based on market conditions, such as interest rates, credit spreads and market liquidity. A significant portion of our securities are currently not traded in active markets and therefore have little or no price transparency. As a result, we have estimated the fair value of these illiquid securities based on internal pricing models rather than the sources described above. The determination of estimated cash flows used in pricing models is inherently subjective and imprecise. Changes in market conditions, as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, could result in a significant and immediate increase or decrease in our book equity. For securities valued with pricing models, these inputs include the discount rate, assumptions relating to prepayments, default rates and loss severities, as well as other variables.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding the fair value of our investments, and respective estimation methodologies, as of December 31, 2016.\nOur securities must be categorized by the level\u201d of inputs used in estimating their fair values. Level 1 would be assets or liabilities valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. We have no Level 1 assets or liabilities. Level 2 would be assets or liabilities valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets, or on other observable\u201d market inputs. Level 3 would be assets or liabilities valued based significantly on unobservable\u201d market inputs. Fair value under GAAP represents an exit price in the normal course of business, not a forced liquidation price. If we were forced to sell assets in a short period to meet liquidity needs, the prices we receive could be substantially less than the recorded fair values.\nWe generally classify non-binding broker and pricing service quotations we receive as Level 3 inputs. Such quotations are quoted prices in generally inactive and illiquid markets for identical or similar securities. These quotations are generally received via email and contain disclaimers which state that they are indicative\u201d and not actionable\u201d - meaning that the party giving the quotation is not bound to actually purchase the security at the quoted price. These quotations are generally based on models prepared by the brokers, and we have little visibility into the inputs they use. Based on quarterly procedures we have performed with respect to quotations received from these brokers, including comparison to the outputs generated from our internal pricing models and transactions we have completed with respect to these securities, as well as on our knowledge and experience of these markets, we have generally determined that these quotes represent a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $627.3 million carrying value of Level 2 assets.\nOur estimation of the fair value of Level 3 assets valued using internal models involves significant judgment. The inputs to our models include discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and severity assumptions. We validate the inputs and outputs of our models by comparing them to available independent third-party market parameters and models for reasonableness, as well as historical performance. We believe the assumptions we use are within the range that a market participant would use and factor in the liquidity conditions currently in the markets. In 2016, the inputs to our models, including discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and severity assumptions, have generally remained consistent with the assumptions used at December 31, 2015.\nFor securities valued with internal models, which have an aggregate fair value of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2016, a 10% unfavorable change in our assumptions would result in the following decreases in such aggregate fair value (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>ABS - Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding face amount\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on fair value with 10% unfavorable change in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA 10% unfavorable change in prepayment rate, default rate and loss severity have no impact on the ABS - Non-Agency RMBS fair value.\nImpairment of Securities and Other Investments\nWe must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities, if any, reflect a decline in value which is other-than-temporary and, if so, write the impaired security down to its fair value through earnings. A decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary if (i) it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a security which was not impaired at acquisition (there is an expected credit loss), or (ii) if we have the intent to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position prior to its anticipated recovery (if any). For the purposes of performing this analysis, we assume the anticipated recovery period is until the respective security's expected maturity. For certain securities which represent beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and non-Agency RMBS acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality for which it was deemed probable, at acquisition, that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments as they come due, an other-than-temporary impairment also will be deemed to have occurred whenever there is a probable adverse change in the timing or amounts of previously projected estimated cash flows.\nTemporary declines in value generally result from changes in market factors, such as market interest rates and credit spreads, or from certain macroeconomic events, including market disruptions and supply changes, which do not directly impact our ability to collect amounts contractually due. We continually evaluate the credit status of each of our securities and the collateral supporting our securities. This evaluation includes a review of the credit of the issuer of the security (if applicable), the credit rating of the security, the key terms of the security (including credit support), debt service coverage and loan to value ratios, the performance of the pool of underlying loans and the estimated value of the collateral supporting such loans, including the effect of local, industry and broader economic trends and factors. These factors include loan default expectations and loss severities, which are analyzed in connection with a particular security's credit support, as well as prepayment rates. These factors are also analyzed in relation to the amount of the unrealized loss and the period elapsed since it was incurred. The result of this evaluation is considered when determining management's estimate of cash flows, particularly with respect to developing the necessary inputs and assumptions. Each security is impacted by different factors and in different ways; generally the more negative factors which are identified with respect to a given security, the more likely we are to determine that we do not expect to receive all contractual payments when due with respect to that security. Significant judgment is required in this analysis.\nWe generally do not depend on credit ratings in underwriting our securities, either at acquisition or on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had no securities that had been downgraded during 2016. As mentioned above, a credit rating downgrade is one factor that we monitor and consider in our analysis regarding other-than-temporary impairment, but it is not determinative. Our securities generally benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or equity or other forms of credit support. Therefore, credit rating downgrades, even to the extent they relate to an expectation that a securitization we have invested in, on an overall basis, has credit issues, may not ultimately impact cash flow estimates for the class of securities in which we are invested.\nFurthermore, the analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in an unrealized loss position prior to an expected recovery in value (if any), the amount of such expected required sales, and the projected identification of which securities would be sold is also subject to significant judgment.\nWe evaluate our other investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. The evaluation of recoverability is based on management's assessment of the financial condition and near term prospects of the commercial real estate project, the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, availability and cost of financing, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management's assumptions, the values estimated by management in its recoverability analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future.\nRevenue Recognition on Securities\nIncome on these securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. For securities that are not acquired at a discount for credit quality, these assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts (which may be subject to prepayments and defaults). For securities acquired at a discount for credit quality and with respect to which management has determined at acquisition that it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, these assumptions also include expected losses. For these securities, we recognize the excess of all expected cash flows over our investment in the securities, referred to as accretable yield, as Interest Income on a loss-adjusted yield basis. The loss adjusted yield is determined based on an evaluation of the credit status of securities, as described in connection with the analysis of impairment above. The excess of total contractual cash flows over the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference and is not recognized as income. The assumptions that impact income recognition are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular\nsecurity, actual historical data, and market changes. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events, and economic and market conditions, which may alter the assumptions.\nValuation of Derivatives\nOur derivative instruments are carried at fair value which is based on counterparty quotations and pricing services. The Company reports the fair value of derivative instruments gross of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements. To the extent they qualify as cash flow hedges, net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income; otherwise, the net unrealized gains and losses are reported currently in other income. To the extent they qualify as fair value hedges, net unrealized gains or losses on both the derivative and the related portion of the hedged item are reported currently in income. Fair values of such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as the securities discussed above, including counterparty credit risk. The results of such variability, the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the extent to which a forecasted hedged transaction remains probable of occurring, could result in a significant increase or decrease in our GAAP equity and/or earnings.\nLoans\nWe invest in loans, including, but not limited to, real estate related and other loans, residential mortgage loans and subprime mortgage loans. Loans for which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified as held-for-investment. Loans for which we do not have the intent or the ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified as held-for-sale. Loans are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of any unamortized discount (or gross of any unamortized premium) and an allowance for loan losses. We determine at acquisition whether loans will be aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics (credit quality, loan type, and date of origination or acquisition); loans aggregated into pools are accounted for as if each pool were a single loan. We also evaluate our loans at acquisition for evidence of credit quality deterioration. Loans for which we determine that it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments at acquisition are categorized as loans acquired at a discount for credit quality.\nRevenue Recognition on Loans Held for Sale\nReal estate related, commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans that are considered held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value determined on either an individual method basis, or in the aggregate for pools of similar loans. Interest income is recognized based on the loan's coupon rate to the extent management believes it is collectible. Purchase discounts are not amortized as interest income during the period the loan is held for sale, except when a pay down or sale has happened in the period. Similarly, for loans acquired at a discount for credit quality, accretable yield is not recorded as interest income during the period the loan is held for sale. A change in the market value of the loan, to the extent that the value is not above the average cost basis, is recorded in Valuation Allowance. A rollforward of the allowance is included in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAcquisition Accounting\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The accounting for acquisitions requires the identification and measurement of all acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired, management uses information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, leasing activities and independent appraisals. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgment and estimation.\nImpairment of Investments in Real Estate\nReal estate and long-lived assets are tested for potential impairment when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment is determined to have occurred if the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated is less than the carrying value of an asset. The impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the fair value. We may use assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business projections, expected growth rates, discount rates, and tax rates. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions, interest rates, and other market data. Many of the factors used in these assumptions and estimates are outside the control of management, and can change in future periods.\nIntangible Assets\nWe assess the potential impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We perform our impairment test by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe assess the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets, or other appropriate grouping of assets, may not be fully recoverable. The assessment of recoverability is based on comparing management's estimates of the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying asset, or other appropriate grouping of assets, to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment existed at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors leading to impairment include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nMembership Deposit Liabilities\nIn our Traditional Golf business, private country club members generally pay an advance initiation fee deposit upon their acceptance as a member to the respective country club. Initiation fee deposits are refundable 30 years after the date of acceptance as a member. The difference between the initiation fee deposit paid by the member and the present value of the refund obligation is deferred and recognized into revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the expected life of an active membership, which is estimated to be seven years. The present value of the refund obligation is recorded as a membership deposit liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accretes over a 30-year nonrefundable term using the effective interest method. This accretion is recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Not meaningful\nGolf Course Operations\nGolf course operations increased by $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: (i) a $3.9 million increase from the introduction of The Players Club program which increased driving range revenues at public golf properties, (ii) a $1.6 million increase in annual member fees partially offset by (iii) a $3.8 million decrease in greens and cart fees resulting from lease terminations in 2014 and (iv) a $0.3 million decrease due to reductions in merchandise sales and other club revenues resulting from lease terminations in 2014 and 2015.\nSales of Food and Beverages\nSales of food and beverages increased by $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in private event revenues and new marketing programs offering various all-inclusive packages at certain traditional golf properties, partially offset by reductions from lease terminations in 2014 and 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased by $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to: (i) a $2.0 million decrease of payroll expense as a result of lease terminations in 2014 and 2015, (ii) a $2.7 million decrease of utilities expense primarily as a result of water restrictions across courses in California, (iii) a $3.3 million decrease in rent expense primarily due to lease terminations in 2014 and 2015, (iv) a $0.5 million decrease in operating lease expenses as a result of fewer operating leases and more capital leases, and (v) a $0.3 million decrease of property insurance expenses as a result of lease terminations in 2014 and 2015.\nCost of Sales - Food and Beverages\nCost of sales increased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increased purchasing associated with new marketing programs offering various all-inclusive packages at certain traditional golf properties.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (including Acquisition and Transaction Expense)\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease of $2.9 million in transaction related expenses and a decrease of $0.9 million in loan and security servicing expense due to the pay down and sale of securities and loans in our CDOs and the sale of the manufactured housing and residential whole loan portfolios in 2014.\nManagement Fee to Affiliate\nManagement fees decreased by $10.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to decreases in gross equity as a result of the New Media spin-off in February 2014 and the New Senior spin-off in November 2014. This was partially offset by an increase in gross equity as a result of our public offerings of common stock in August 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the write-off of intangible liabilities resulting from traditional golf property lease terminations and lease modifications in 2014.\nImpairment (Reversal)\nImpairment increased by $14.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: (i) a $12.8 million increase in valuation allowances related to our real estate related loans offset by a $0.9 million decrease in allowances related to our manufactured housing and residential mortgage loan portfolios. We also recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $2.0 million on two debt securities and $0.4 million on one equity security during the year ended December 31, 2015.

This was offset by $13.5 million of losses associated with the settlement of derivatives in the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recognized an unrealized gain of $1.8 million associated with the mark-to-market on derivatives. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $32.5 million related to the sale of our manufactured housing loan portfolio and residential whole loans portfolio, and a gain of $23.7 million on the sale of debt securities, offset by $4.2 million of losses associated with the settlement of derivatives. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we also recorded an unrealized gain of $12.5 million associated with income recognized on linked transactions and an unrealized gain of $5.1 million on derivatives.\nInterest and Investment Income\nInterest and investment income decreased by $31.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: (i) a $16.0 million net decrease as a result of the sales and pay downs of real estate related loans in CDOs VIII and IX, (ii) an $8.9 million decrease as a result of the sale of the manufactured housing and residential mortgage loan portfolios during 2014, (iii) a decrease of $19.2 million due to the sale and pay downs of securities in our CDOs during 2014 and 2015, and (iv) a decrease of $0.5 million related to income recognized on the subprime mortgage loans subject to call option. These were offset by an increase of $8.7 million related to the addition of Agency RMBS and an increase of $4.2 million related to additional PIK interest earned on two real estate related loans.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $17.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: (i) a $10.0 million decrease in swap interest expense due to a lower notional balance in 2015 compared to 2014, (ii) a $2.4 million decrease in the other debt segment primarily due to the payoff of the debt following the sale of the manufactured housing and residential mortgage loan portfolio in May 2014, (iii) a $5.6 million decrease in the CDO segment due\nto pay downs of debt as a result of pay downs and sales of assets, (iv) a decrease of $1.1 million primarily due to repurchase of the golf debts in August 2015, and (v) a decrease of $0.5 million related to expenses recognized on the subprime mortgage loans subject to call option. This was offset by (i) an increase of $1.1 million due to higher balances of repurchase agreements financing the Agency RMBS portfolio, (ii) an increase of $0.4 million related to higher capital lease financing costs associated with the Traditional Golf business, and (iii) a $0.2 million increase related to higher interest accretion expense related to the traditional golf membership deposit liabilities.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe gain on extinguishment of debt of $15.3 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 is due to (i) $15.4 million gain related to the repurchase of the first and second lien golf debt from a third party in August 2015, (ii) $0.5 million gain related to the repurchase of CDO bonds payable in June 2015, offset by $0.6 million of losses associated with the write-off of traditional golf liabilities. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the write-off of the unamortized discount on the manufactured housing debt upon the sale of the portfolio and the payoff of the debt in May 2014.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income decreased by $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: (i) a $6.8 million decrease primarily related to gains recognized in 2014 on a lease modification related to a traditional golf property, (ii) a $7.1 million decrease in equity in earnings in equity method investees, (iii) a $0.5 million decrease related to deferred fee income recognized on the payoff of a real estate related loan in January 2014, (iv) a $0.3 million decrease related to fees from servicing third party CDOs and (v) a $0.7 million decrease related to various other traditional golf income items in 2015. This was partially offset by (i) a $0.5 million increase related to receipt of funds in 2015 related to the sale of the manufactured housing loan portfolio in May 2014 and (ii) a $1.0 million increase related to receipts on real estate related loans.\nTraditional Golf Segment Results\nComparison of Traditional Golf Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf course operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of food and beverages\n</td> <td>72,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>298,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>254,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales -

We have the ability to publicly or privately issue common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities and warrants. Our debt obligations are generally secured directly by our investment assets, except for the junior subordinated notes payable.\nSources of Liquidity and Uses of Capital\nAs of the date of this filing, we believe we have sufficient liquid assets, which include unrestricted cash, to satisfy all of our short-term recourse liabilities. Our junior subordinated notes payable are long-term obligations. With respect to the next 12 months, we expect that our cash on hand combined with our other primary sources of funds for liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs with respect to our current portfolio, including related financings, capital expenditures for our Traditional and Entertainment golf businesses, working capital needs, potential margin calls and operating expenses. In addition, we may have additional cash requirements with respect to incremental investments related to our Traditional Golf business and executing our strategic objectives for our Entertainment Golf business. In addition to our available cash, we may elect to meet the cash requirements of these incremental investments through proceeds from the monetization of our assets or from additional borrowings or equity offerings. While it is inherently more difficult to forecast beyond the next 12 months, we currently expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, specifically the repayment of our recourse debt obligations, through our cash on hand and, if needed, additional borrowings, proceeds from equity offerings and the liquidation or refinancing of our assets. We continually monitor market conditions for financing opportunities, and at any given time, we may enter into or pursue one or more of the transactions described above.\nThese short-term and long-term expectations are forward-looking and subject to a number of uncertainties and assumptions, which are described below under -Factors That Could Impact Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\u201d as well as Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d If our assumptions about our liquidity prove to be incorrect, we could be subject to a shortfall in liquidity in the future, and this shortfall may occur rapidly and with little or no notice, which would limit our ability to address the shortfall on a timely basis.\nCash flows provided by operations constitute a critical component of our liquidity. Essentially, our cash flows provided by operations is equal to (i) net cash flows received from our Traditional Golf business, plus (ii) the net cash flows from our Debt Investments that are not subject to mandatory debt repayment, including principal and sales proceeds, less (iii) traditional golf operating expenses, management fees, professional fees and insurance, less (iv) interest on the junior subordinated notes payable and less (v) preferred dividends.\nOur cash flows provided by operations differs from our net income (loss) due to these primary factors: (i) accretion of discount or premium on our real estate securities and loans (including the accrual of interest payable at maturity) and deferred financing costs, (ii) amortization of favorable and unfavorable leasehold intangibles\u200e from the acquisition of the Traditional Golf business in December 2013, (iii) accretion of the golf membership deposit liabilities in interest expense, (iv) amortization of prepaid golf membership dues, (v) gains and losses from sales of assets, (vi) the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our loan assets, as well as other-than-temporary impairment on our securities, Traditional Golf business and other investments, (vii) unrealized gains or losses on our investments, (viii) non-cash gains or losses associated with our early extinguishment of debt, (ix) non-cash gains on deconsolidation, and (x) depreciation and amortization on our investments. Proceeds from the sale of assets which serve as collateral for our CDO financings, including gains thereon, are required to be retained in the CDO structure until the related bonds are retired and are, therefore, not available to fund current cash needs outside of these structures.\nThe sources of our distributions are net cash provided by operating activities, net cash provided by investing activities and cash equivalents as they represent the return on our portfolio of investments in real estate debt and golf related real estate and operations. The Company has paid common dividends of $32.0 million and preferred dividends of $5.6 million in fiscal year 2016. However, our board of directors elected not to pay a common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2017 to retain capital for growth. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 million, net cash used in investing activities of $152.6 million, net cash provided by financing activities of $243.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of $140.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Prior to termination of our REIT election, we made distributions of a minimum of 90% of our taxable income each year in order to maintain our REIT status. As a result of our revocation of REIT election, effective January 1, 2017, we are no longer subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs. The timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our board of directors, which considers our earnings, financial performance and condition, debt service obligations and applicable debt covenants, tax considerations, as well as capital expenditure requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nUpdate on Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\nCash - As of December 31, 2016, we had $140.1 million of available cash, including $18.3 million of working capital for the Traditional Golf business. On December 7, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $9.4 million which was paid on January 31, 2017.\nCertain details regarding our liquidity, current financings and capital obligations as of February 22, 2017 are set forth below:\nMargin Exposure and Recourse Financings - We have margin exposure on a $595.4 million repurchase agreements related to the financing of FNMA/FHLMC securities. The mezzanine note payable was repaid in April 2016 and golf loans repurchase agreement was repaid in June 2016. See Note 11 to Part II, Item 8.

In some cases, such collateral is not available to other creditors of ours.\nThe financing of our Traditional Golf business contain various customary loan covenants, including certain coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all of the covenants in these financings as of December 31, 2016.

agreements. We also financed additional repurchased CDO debt with $30.8 million of repurchase agreements. In June 2014, we repaid $60.0 million of repurchase agreements associated with our linked transaction as the underlying assets were paid off. Additionally, in June 2014 we financed previously repurchased CDO debt with $26.3 million of repurchase agreements. In July 2014, we sold $37.4 million face amount of residential mortgage loans for total proceeds of $34.7 million and repaid $23.0 million of repurchase agreements associated with these loans.\nSee Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about the FNMA/FHLMC repurchase agreement activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about the CDO securities and Golf Loans repurchase agreement activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe weighted average differences between the fair value of the assets and the face amount of financing of the FNMA/FHLMC repurchase agreements was 4% as of December 31, 2016.\nSubprime Securitization\nIn March 2006, we acquired a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans ( Subprime Portfolio I\u201d) for $1.50 billion. In April 2006, Newcastle Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-1 ( Securitization Trust 2006\u201d) closed on a securitization of Subprime Portfolio I. We do not consolidate Securitization Trust 2006. We sold Subprime Portfolio I to Securitization Trust 2006, which issued $1.45 billion of notes with a stated maturity of March 2036. We, as holder of the equity of Securitization Trust 2006, have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of Subprime Portfolio I is equal to or less than 20% of such balance at the date of the transfer. The transaction between us and Securitization Trust 2006 qualified as a sale for accounting purposes. However, 20% of the loans which are subject to a call option by us, were not treated as being sold. Following the securitization, we held the following interests in Subprime Portfolio I: (i) the equity of Securitization Trust 2006, (ii) the retained notes, and (iii) subprime mortgage loans subject to call option and related financing in the amount of 100% of such loans (we note that this interest is non-economic if we do not exercise the option, meaning that it has no impact on us).\nIn March 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans ( Subprime Portfolio II\u201d) with up to $1.7 billion of unpaid principal balance. In July 2007, Newcastle Mortgage Securities Trust 2007-1 ( Securitization Trust 2007\u201d) closed on a securitization of Subprime Portfolio II. As a result of the repurchase of delinquent loans by the seller, as well as borrower repayments, the unpaid principal balance of the portfolio upon securitization was $1.1 billion. We do not consolidate Securitization Trust 2007. We sold Subprime Portfolio II to Securitization Trust 2007, which issued $1.0 billion of notes with a stated maturity of April 2037. We, as holder of the equity of Securitization Trust 2007, have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of Subprime Portfolio II is equal to or less than 10% of such balance at the date of the transfer. The transaction between us and Securitization Trust 2007 qualified as a sale for accounting purposes. However, 10% of the loans which are subject to a call option by us were not treated as being sold. Following the securitization, we held the following interests in Subprime Portfolio II: (i) the equity of Securitization Trust 2007, (ii) the retained notes, and (iii) subprime mortgage loans subject to call option and related financing in the amount of 100% of such loans (we note that this interest is non-economic, meaning that if we do not exercise the option it has no impact on us).\nWe have no obligation to repurchase any loans from either of our subprime securitizations. Therefore, it is expected that our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount of our retained interests in the securitization entities, as described above.

Moreover, if we do not pay dividends on any series of preferred stock for six or more periods, then holders of each affected series obtain the right to call a special meeting and elect two members to our board of directors. Consequently, if we do not make a dividend payment on our preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, it could restrict the actions that we may take with respect to our common stock and preferred stock and could affect the composition of our board of directors and, thus, the management of our business. No assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on any series of our preferred stock in the future.\nAll accrued dividends on our preferred stock have been paid through January 31, 2017.\nSee Note 12 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information on our preferred stock.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling interest represents the equity interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries not owned by Drive Shack Inc. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in Drive Shack Inc.'s ownership interest while the Company retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and, upon a gain or loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.\nDrive Shack Inc.'s noncontrolling interest is related to our Traditional Golf business, a portion of which the Company does not own. In October 2016, we exited certain golf properties in which the Company had a noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest associated with the remaining golf property has a carrying value of zero.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) changed due to the following factors (in thousands):\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gains/ Losses on Cash Flow Hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gains / Losses on Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), December, 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized loss on available for sale securities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of net realized/unrealized loss on securities into earnings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of net realized gain on deconsolidation of CDO VI\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of net realized loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges into earnings\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur GAAP equity changes as our real estate securities portfolio and derivatives are marked to market each quarter, among other factors. The primary causes of mark-to-market changes are changes in interest rates. Net unrealized gains on our real estate securities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily as a result of gains recognized in earnings from the deconsolidation of CDO VI and net unrealized losses on our fixed rate Agency RMBS caused by rising interest rates towards the end of the year ended December 31, 2016. These were partially offset by net losses realized in earnings that were primarily driven by the reclassification of unrealized losses into earnings on Agency RMBS due to the Company's intent to sell these securities.\nSee - Market Considerations\u201d above for a further discussion of recent trends and events affecting our unrealized gains and losses as well as our liquidity.\nCash Flow\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities changed from $(2.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

We have not accessed the capital markets since 2014, and rising interest rates or stock market volatility could impair our ability to raise equity capital on attractive terms.\nOur ability to generate income is dependent on, among other factors, our ability to raise capital and finance investments on favorable terms, deploy capital on a timely basis at attractive returns, and exit investments at favorable yields. Market conditions outside of our control, such as interest rates, credit spreads and stock market volatility affect these objectives in a variety of ways.\nTraditional Golf\nWith respect to our Traditional Golf business, trends in consumer discretionary spending as well as climate and weather patterns have a significant impact on the markets in which we operate. Traditional Golf is subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by significant reductions in golf activities as well as revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each year, due to shorter days and colder temperatures. Consequently, a significantly larger portion of our revenue from our Traditional Golf operations is earned in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In addition, severe weather patterns can also negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhile consumer spending in the Traditional Golf industry has generally been declining in recent years, we believe improving economic conditions and improvements in local housing markets has helped and will continue to help drive membership growth and increase the number of golf rounds played. In addition, we believe growth in related industries, including leisure entertainment, can positively impact our traditional golf business.\nDebt Investments\nDuring the year, both short-term and long-term interest rates remained at or near historical lows. We project short- and long-term rates to increase in the future, although the timing of any further increases is uncertain. We have investments in both floating and fixed rate securities and loans, which are affected by interest rates in different ways. We expect that the value of our floating rate assets would not be significantly affected by a change in interest rates (whether an increase or decrease), since the coupon tracks the movement in rates, while the value of fixed rate assets can be negatively affected by rising interest rates. However, in general, rising interest rates are usually indicative of a strengthening economic environment, which could reduce the credit risk of some of our investments. With respect to our fixed rate assets, we believe that the negative impact of rising interest rates could potentially be offset by the positive impact of reduced credit risk.\nCredit spreads also affect the value of our investments in debt securities and loans. Credit spreads decreased or \"tightened,\" marginally during 2015 and 2016, which had a minimal impact on the value of our portfolio. Credit spreads measure the yield relative to a specified benchmark that the market demands on securities and loans based on the credit risk of such assets. The value of our portfolio tends to increase when spreads tighten and to decrease when spreads widen. Credit spreads also affect the cost of financing, with widening spreads tending to increase the cost, and tightening spreads tending to reduce it.\nThe net interest spread of our portfolio of Debt Investments can be impacted by (i) the timing and extent of changes in the composition of our portfolio as a result of purchases and sales of assets or the repayment of debt, repurchase agreements and other\nbonds, the incurrence of new debt, (ii) the yields on new investments, which varies depending on the credit quality of the issuer, and (iii) changes in our estimates of the yields on securities acquired at a discount for credit quality. For instance, the net interest spread of our Debt Investments increases if we sell assets with lower yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale or refinancing) that has a higher interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio (assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio). Conversely, the net interest spread of our portfolio decreases if we sell assets with higher yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale) that has a lower interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio (again, assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio). Management continually monitors market conditions to opportunistically effect purchases and sales of debt investments.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our estimates are based on information available to management at the time of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the result of historical analysis, our understanding and experience of the Company's operations, our knowledge of the industry and market-participant data available to us.\nActual results have historically been in line with management's estimates and judgments used in applying each of the accounting policies described below and management periodically re-evaluates accounting estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates and materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company does not expect our assessments and assumptions below to materially change in the future.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments, estimates and assumptions.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, and only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe VIEs in which we have a significant interest include our CDOs. We do not have the power to direct the relevant activities of CDO V, as a result of an event of default which allows for us to be removed as collateral manager of this CDO and prevents us from purchasing or selling certain collateral within this CDO, and therefore this CDO is not consolidated as of December 31, 2016. In August 2016, the Company settled on a trade to sell $14.8 million face amount of two CDO V securities for total proceeds of $9.9 million (See Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information). As a result of this trade, the Company no longer has an economic interest in CDO V.\nOn March 31, 2016, Drive Shack Inc. sold $11.0 million face amount of NCT 2013-VI Class I-MM-2. As a result of this sale, the Company was no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated CDO VI.\nOur subprime securitizations are also considered VIEs, but we do not control the decisions that most significantly impact their economic performance and no longer receive a significant portion of their returns, and therefore do not consolidate them.\nIn addition, our investments in RMBS and real estate related and other loans may be deemed to be variable interests in VIEs, depending on their structure. We monitor these investments and analyze the potential need to consolidate the related securitization entities pursuant to the VIE consolidation requirements. These analyses require considerable judgment in determining whether an entity is a VIE and determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE since they involve subjective determinations of significance, with respect to both power and economics. The result could be the consolidation of an entity that otherwise would not have been consolidated or the deconsolidation of an entity that otherwise would have been consolidated.\nValuation of Securities\nWe have classified all of our real estate securities as available-for-sale. As such, they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, to the extent impairment losses are considered temporary as described below. Fair value may be based upon broker quotations, counterparty quotations or pricing services quotations, which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications or a good faith estimate thereof and are subject to significant variability based on market conditions, such as interest rates, credit spreads and market liquidity. A significant portion of our securities are currently not traded in active markets and therefore have little or no price transparency. As a result, we have estimated the fair value of these illiquid securities based on internal pricing models rather than the sources described above. The determination of estimated cash flows used in pricing models is inherently subjective and imprecise. Changes in market conditions, as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, could result in a significant and immediate increase or decrease in our book equity. For securities valued with pricing models, these inputs include the discount rate, assumptions relating to prepayments, default rates and loss severities, as well as other variables.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding the fair value of our investments, and respective estimation methodologies, as of December 31, 2016.\nOur securities must be categorized by the level\u201d of inputs used in estimating their fair values. Level 1 would be assets or liabilities valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. We have no Level 1 assets or liabilities. Level 2 would be assets or liabilities valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets, or on other observable\u201d market inputs. Level 3 would be assets or liabilities valued based significantly on unobservable\u201d market inputs. Fair value under GAAP represents an exit price in the normal course of business, not a forced liquidation price. If we were forced to sell assets in a short period to meet liquidity needs, the prices we receive could be substantially less than the recorded fair values.\nWe generally classify non-binding broker and pricing service quotations we receive as Level 3 inputs. Such quotations are quoted prices in generally inactive and illiquid markets for identical or similar securities. These quotations are generally received via email and contain disclaimers which state that they are indicative\u201d and not actionable\u201d - meaning that the party giving the quotation is not bound to actually purchase the security at the quoted price. These quotations are generally based on models prepared by the brokers, and we have little visibility into the inputs they use. Based on quarterly procedures we have performed with respect to quotations received from these brokers, including comparison to the outputs generated from our internal pricing models and transactions we have completed with respect to these securities, as well as on our knowledge and experience of these markets, we have generally determined that these quotes represent a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $627.3 million carrying value of Level 2 assets.\nOur estimation of the fair value of Level 3 assets valued using internal models involves significant judgment. The inputs to our models include discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and severity assumptions. We validate the inputs and outputs of our models by comparing them to available independent third-party market parameters and models for reasonableness, as well as historical performance. We believe the assumptions we use are within the range that a market participant would use and factor in the liquidity conditions currently in the markets. In 2016, the inputs to our models, including discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and severity assumptions, have generally remained consistent with the assumptions used at December 31, 2015.\nFor securities valued with internal models, which have an aggregate fair value of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2016, a 10% unfavorable change in our assumptions would result in the following decreases in such aggregate fair value (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>ABS - Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding face amount\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on fair value with 10% unfavorable change in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA 10% unfavorable change in prepayment rate, default rate and loss severity have no impact on the ABS - Non-Agency RMBS fair value.\nImpairment of Securities and Other Investments\nWe must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities, if any, reflect a decline in value which is other-than-temporary and, if so, write the impaired security down to its fair value through earnings. A decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary if (i) it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a security which was not impaired at acquisition (there is an expected credit loss), or (ii) if we have the intent to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position prior to its anticipated recovery (if any). For the purposes of performing this analysis, we assume the anticipated recovery period is until the respective security's expected maturity. For certain securities which represent beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and non-Agency RMBS acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality for which it was deemed probable, at acquisition, that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments as they come due, an other-than-temporary impairment also will be deemed to have occurred whenever there is a probable adverse change in the timing or amounts of previously projected estimated cash flows.\nTemporary declines in value generally result from changes in market factors, such as market interest rates and credit spreads, or from certain macroeconomic events, including market disruptions and supply changes, which do not directly impact our ability to collect amounts contractually due. We continually evaluate the credit status of each of our securities and the collateral supporting our securities. This evaluation includes a review of the credit of the issuer of the security (if applicable), the credit rating of the security, the key terms of the security (including credit support), debt service coverage and loan to value ratios, the performance of the pool of underlying loans and the estimated value of the collateral supporting such loans, including the effect of local, industry and broader economic trends and factors. These factors include loan default expectations and loss severities, which are analyzed in connection with a particular security's credit support, as well as prepayment rates. These factors are also analyzed in relation to the amount of the unrealized loss and the period elapsed since it was incurred. The result of this evaluation is considered when determining management's estimate of cash flows, particularly with respect to developing the necessary inputs and assumptions. Each security is impacted by different factors and in different ways; generally the more negative factors which are identified with respect to a given security, the more likely we are to determine that we do not expect to receive all contractual payments when due with respect to that security. Significant judgment is required in this analysis.\nWe generally do not depend on credit ratings in underwriting our securities, either at acquisition or on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had no securities that had been downgraded during 2016. As mentioned above, a credit rating downgrade is one factor that we monitor and consider in our analysis regarding other-than-temporary impairment, but it is not determinative. Our securities generally benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or equity or other forms of credit support. Therefore, credit rating downgrades, even to the extent they relate to an expectation that a securitization we have invested in, on an overall basis, has credit issues, may not ultimately impact cash flow estimates for the class of securities in which we are invested.\nFurthermore, the analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in an unrealized loss position prior to an expected recovery in value (if any), the amount of such expected required sales, and the projected identification of which securities would be sold is also subject to significant judgment.\nWe evaluate our other investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. The evaluation of recoverability is based on management's assessment of the financial condition and near term prospects of the commercial real estate project, the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, availability and cost of financing, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management's assumptions, the values estimated by management in its recoverability analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future.\nRevenue Recognition on Securities\nIncome on these securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. For securities that are not acquired at a discount for credit quality, these assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts (which may be subject to prepayments and defaults). For securities acquired at a discount for credit quality and with respect to which management has determined at acquisition that it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, these assumptions also include expected losses. For these securities, we recognize the excess of all expected cash flows over our investment in the securities, referred to as accretable yield, as Interest Income on a loss-adjusted yield basis. The loss adjusted yield is determined based on an evaluation of the credit status of securities, as described in connection with the analysis of impairment above. The excess of total contractual cash flows over the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference and is not recognized as income. The assumptions that impact income recognition are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular\nsecurity, actual historical data, and market changes. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events, and economic and market conditions, which may alter the assumptions.\nValuation of Derivatives\nOur derivative instruments are carried at fair value which is based on counterparty quotations and pricing services. The Company reports the fair value of derivative instruments gross of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements. To the extent they qualify as cash flow hedges, net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income; otherwise, the net unrealized gains and losses are reported currently in other income. To the extent they qualify as fair value hedges, net unrealized gains or losses on both the derivative and the related portion of the hedged item are reported currently in income. Fair values of such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as the securities discussed above, including counterparty credit risk. The results of such variability, the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the extent to which a forecasted hedged transaction remains probable of occurring, could result in a significant increase or decrease in our GAAP equity and/or earnings.\nLoans\nWe invest in loans, including, but not limited to, real estate related and other loans, residential mortgage loans and subprime mortgage loans. Loans for which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified as held-for-investment. Loans for which we do not have the intent or the ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified as held-for-sale. Loans are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of any unamortized discount (or gross of any unamortized premium) and an allowance for loan losses. We determine at acquisition whether loans will be aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics (credit quality, loan type, and date of origination or acquisition); loans aggregated into pools are accounted for as if each pool were a single loan. We also evaluate our loans at acquisition for evidence of credit quality deterioration. Loans for which we determine that it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments at acquisition are categorized as loans acquired at a discount for credit quality.\nRevenue Recognition on Loans Held for Sale\nReal estate related, commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans that are considered held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value determined on either an individual method basis, or in the aggregate for pools of similar loans. Interest income is recognized based on the loan's coupon rate to the extent management believes it is collectible. Purchase discounts are not amortized as interest income during the period the loan is held for sale, except when a pay down or sale has happened in the period. Similarly, for loans acquired at a discount for credit quality, accretable yield is not recorded as interest income during the period the loan is held for sale. A change in the market value of the loan, to the extent that the value is not above the average cost basis, is recorded in Valuation Allowance. A rollforward of the allowance is included in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAcquisition Accounting\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The accounting for acquisitions requires the identification and measurement of all acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired, management uses information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, leasing activities and independent appraisals. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgment and estimation.\nImpairment of Investments in Real Estate\nReal estate and long-lived assets are tested for potential impairment when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment is determined to have occurred if the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated is less than the carrying value of an asset. The impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the fair value. We may use assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business projections, expected growth rates, discount rates, and tax rates. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions, interest rates, and other market data. Many of the factors used in these assumptions and estimates are outside the control of management, and can change in future periods.\nIntangible Assets\nWe assess the potential impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We perform our impairment test by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe assess the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets, or other appropriate grouping of assets, may not be fully recoverable. The assessment of recoverability is based on comparing management's estimates of the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying asset, or other appropriate grouping of assets, to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment existed at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors leading to impairment include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nMembership Deposit Liabilities\nIn our Traditional Golf business, private country club members generally pay an advance initiation fee deposit upon their acceptance as a member to the respective country club. Initiation fee deposits are refundable 30 years after the date of acceptance as a member. The difference between the initiation fee deposit paid by the member and the present value of the refund obligation is deferred and recognized into revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the expected life of an active membership, which is estimated to be seven years. The present value of the refund obligation is recorded as a membership deposit liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accretes over a 30-year nonrefundable term using the effective interest method. This accretion is recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The determination of the estimated average expected life of an active membership is based on company-specific historical data and involves significant judgment and estimation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nThe following tables summarize the changes in our consolidated results of operations from year-to-year (dollars in thousands):\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparison of Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf course operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of food and beverages\n</td> <td>72,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>298,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>254,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales -

This was partially offset by an increase in gross equity as a result of our public offerings of common stock in August 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the write-off of intangible liabilities resulting from traditional golf property lease terminations and lease modifications in 2014.\nImpairment (Reversal)\nImpairment increased by $14.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: (i) a $12.8 million increase in valuation allowances related to our real estate related loans offset by a $0.9 million decrease in allowances related to our manufactured housing and residential mortgage loan portfolios.

This was offset by $13.5 million of losses associated with the settlement of derivatives in the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recognized an unrealized gain of $1.8 million associated with the mark-to-market on derivatives.

We have the ability to publicly or privately issue common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities and warrants. Our debt obligations are generally secured directly by our investment assets, except for the junior subordinated notes payable.\nSources of Liquidity and Uses of Capital\nAs of the date of this filing, we believe we have sufficient liquid assets, which include unrestricted cash, to satisfy all of our short-term recourse liabilities. Our junior subordinated notes payable are long-term obligations. With respect to the next 12 months, we expect that our cash on hand combined with our other primary sources of funds for liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs with respect to our current portfolio, including related financings, capital expenditures for our Traditional and Entertainment golf businesses, working capital needs, potential margin calls and operating expenses. In addition, we may have additional cash requirements with respect to incremental investments related to our Traditional Golf business and executing our strategic objectives for our Entertainment Golf business. In addition to our available cash, we may elect to meet the cash requirements of these incremental investments through proceeds from the monetization of our assets or from additional borrowings or equity offerings. While it is inherently more difficult to forecast beyond the next 12 months, we currently expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, specifically the repayment of our recourse debt obligations, through our cash on hand and, if needed, additional borrowings, proceeds from equity offerings and the liquidation or refinancing of our assets. We continually monitor market conditions for financing opportunities, and at any given time, we may enter into or pursue one or more of the transactions described above.\nThese short-term and long-term expectations are forward-looking and subject to a number of uncertainties and assumptions, which are described below under -Factors That Could Impact Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\u201d as well as Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d If our assumptions about our liquidity prove to be incorrect, we could be subject to a shortfall in liquidity in the future, and this shortfall may occur rapidly and with little or no notice, which would limit our ability to address the shortfall on a timely basis.\nCash flows provided by operations constitute a critical component of our liquidity. Essentially, our cash flows provided by operations is equal to (i) net cash flows received from our Traditional Golf business, plus (ii) the net cash flows from our Debt Investments that are not subject to mandatory debt repayment, including principal and sales proceeds, less (iii) traditional golf operating expenses, management fees, professional fees and insurance, less (iv) interest on the junior subordinated notes payable and less (v) preferred dividends.\nOur cash flows provided by operations differs from our net income (loss) due to these primary factors: (i) accretion of discount or premium on our real estate securities and loans (including the accrual of interest payable at maturity) and deferred financing costs, (ii) amortization of favorable and unfavorable leasehold intangibles\u200e from the acquisition of the Traditional Golf business in December 2013, (iii) accretion of the golf membership deposit liabilities in interest expense, (iv) amortization of prepaid golf membership dues, (v) gains and losses from sales of assets, (vi) the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our loan assets, as well as other-than-temporary impairment on our securities, Traditional Golf business and other investments, (vii) unrealized gains or losses on our investments, (viii) non-cash gains or losses associated with our early extinguishment of debt, (ix) non-cash gains on deconsolidation, and (x) depreciation and amortization on our investments. Proceeds from the sale of assets which serve as collateral for our CDO financings, including gains thereon, are required to be retained in the CDO structure until the related bonds are retired and are, therefore, not available to fund current cash needs outside of these structures.\nThe sources of our distributions are net cash provided by operating activities, net cash provided by investing activities and cash equivalents as they represent the return on our portfolio of investments in real estate debt and golf related real estate and operations. The Company has paid common dividends of $32.0 million and preferred dividends of $5.6 million in fiscal year 2016. However, our board of directors elected not to pay a common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2017 to retain capital for growth. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 million, net cash used in investing activities of $152.6 million, net cash provided by financing activities of $243.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of $140.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Prior to termination of our REIT election, we made distributions of a minimum of 90% of our taxable income each year in order to maintain our REIT status. As a result of our revocation of REIT election, effective January 1, 2017, we are no longer subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs. The timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our board of directors, which considers our earnings, financial performance and condition, debt service obligations and applicable debt covenants, tax considerations, as well as capital expenditure requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nUpdate on Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\nCash - As of December 31, 2016, we had $140.1 million of available cash, including $18.3 million of working capital for the Traditional Golf business. On December 7, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $9.4 million which was paid on January 31, 2017.\nCertain details regarding our liquidity, current financings and capital obligations as of February 22, 2017 are set forth below:\nMargin Exposure and Recourse Financings - We have margin exposure on a $595.4 million repurchase agreements related to the financing of FNMA/FHLMC securities.

Set forth below is a discussion of some of the factors that could impact our liquidity, available capital resources and capital obligations.\nFactors That Could Impact Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\nWe refer readers to our discussions in other sections of this report for the following information:\n \u2022 For a further discussion of recent trends and events affecting our liquidity, see - Market Considerations\u201d above; \n \u2022 As described above, under - Update on Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations,\u201d we are subject to margin calls in connection with our repurchase agreements; \n \u2022 As described above, under - Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Capital,\u201d we may be subject to capital obligations associated with our Traditional and Entertainment Golf businesses; \n \u2022 Our remaining investments, generally financed with short-term debt or short-term repurchase agreements, are also subject to refinancing risk upon the maturity of the related debt. See - Debt Obligations\u201d below; and \n \u2022 For a further discussion of a number of risks that could affect our liquidity, access to capital resources and our capital obligations, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above. \nIn addition to the information referenced above, the following factors could affect our liquidity, access to capital resources and our capital obligations related to our Traditional and Entertainment Golf businesses. As such, if their outcomes do not fall within our expectations, changes in these factors could negatively affect our liquidity.\n \u2022 Access to Financing from Counterparties - Decisions by investors, counterparties and lenders to enter into transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors, such as our historical and projected financial performance, compliance with the terms of our current credit and derivative arrangements, industry and market trends, the availability of capital and our investors', counterparties' and lenders' policies and rates applicable thereto, and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities. Our business strategy is dependent upon our investments at rates that provide a positive net spread. \n \u2022 Impact of Expected Repayment or Forecasted Sale on Cash Flows - The timing of and proceeds from the repayment or sale of certain investments may be different than expected or may not occur as expected. Proceeds from sales of assets in the current illiquid market environment are unpredictable and may vary materially from their estimated fair value and their carrying value.  Debt Obligations\nCertain of the debt obligations are obligations of our consolidated subsidiaries which own the related collateral. In some cases, such collateral is not available to other creditors of ours.\nThe financing of our Traditional Golf business contain various customary loan covenants, including certain coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all of the covenants in these financings as of December 31, 2016. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had complied with the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors that limit total leverage.\nSee Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information related to our debt obligations and contractual maturities as of December 31, 2016.\nRepurchase Agreements\nThe following table provides additional information regarding short-term borrowings (dollars in thousands). The outstanding short-term borrowings were used to finance certain of our investments in FNMA/FHLMC securities and to finance the acquisition of Golf debt. All of the repurchase agreements have full recourse to Drive Shack Inc.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nO/S - Outstanding\nIn January 2014, we sold $503.0 million face amount of the FNMA/FHLMC securities for total proceeds of $532.2 million and repaid $516.1 million of repurchase agreements. We also financed additional repurchased CDO debt with $30.8 million of repurchase agreements. In June 2014, we repaid $60.0 million of repurchase agreements associated with our linked transaction as the underlying assets were paid off. Additionally, in June 2014 we financed previously repurchased CDO debt with $26.3 million of repurchase agreements. In July 2014, we sold $37.4 million face amount of residential mortgage loans for total proceeds of $34.7 million and repaid $23.0 million of repurchase agreements associated with these loans.\nSee Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about the FNMA/FHLMC repurchase agreement activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about the CDO securities and Golf Loans repurchase agreement activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe weighted average differences between the fair value of the assets and the face amount of financing of the FNMA/FHLMC repurchase agreements was 4% as of December 31, 2016.\nSubprime Securitization\nIn March 2006, we acquired a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans ( Subprime Portfolio I\u201d) for $1.50 billion. In April 2006, Newcastle Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-1 ( Securitization Trust 2006\u201d) closed on a securitization of Subprime Portfolio I. We do not consolidate Securitization Trust 2006. We sold Subprime Portfolio I to Securitization Trust 2006, which issued $1.45 billion of notes with a stated maturity of March 2036. We, as holder of the equity of Securitization Trust 2006, have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of Subprime Portfolio I is equal to or less than 20% of such balance at the date of the transfer. The transaction between us and Securitization Trust 2006 qualified as a sale for accounting purposes. However, 20% of the loans which are subject to a call option by us, were not treated as being sold. Following the securitization, we held the following interests in Subprime Portfolio I: (i) the equity of Securitization Trust 2006, (ii) the retained notes, and (iii) subprime mortgage loans subject to call option and related financing in the amount of 100% of such loans (we note that this interest is non-economic if we do not exercise the option, meaning that it has no impact on us).\nIn March 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans ( Subprime Portfolio II\u201d) with up to $1.7 billion of unpaid principal balance. In July 2007, Newcastle Mortgage Securities Trust 2007-1 ( Securitization Trust 2007\u201d) closed on a securitization of Subprime Portfolio II. As a result of the repurchase of delinquent loans by the seller, as well as borrower repayments, the unpaid principal balance of the portfolio upon securitization was $1.1 billion. We do not consolidate Securitization Trust 2007. We sold Subprime Portfolio II to Securitization Trust 2007, which issued $1.0 billion of notes with a stated maturity of April 2037. We, as holder of the equity of Securitization Trust 2007, have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of Subprime Portfolio II is equal to or less than 10% of such balance at the date of the transfer. The transaction between us and Securitization Trust 2007 qualified as a sale for accounting purposes. However, 10% of the loans which are subject to a call option by us were not treated as being sold. Following the securitization, we held the following interests in Subprime Portfolio II: (i) the equity of Securitization Trust 2007, (ii) the retained notes, and (iii) subprime mortgage loans subject to call option and related financing in the amount of 100% of such loans (we note that this interest is non-economic, meaning that if we do not exercise the option it has no impact on us).\nWe have no obligation to repurchase any loans from either of our subprime securitizations. Therefore, it is expected that our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount of our retained interests in the securitization entities, as described above. A subsidiary of Drive Shack Inc. gave limited representations and warranties with respect to Subprime Portfolio II; however, it has no assets and does not have recourse to the Company's assets.\nOn December 29, 2016, the Company sold the call option to a third party and, as a result of this sale, the loans subject to call option and corresponding financing are no longer reported on Drive Shack Inc.'s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On November 6, 2014, we completed the spin-off of New Senior through a distribution of shares valued at $18.02 per share.  See Note 12 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for detailed information on our options outstanding and option plans.\nPreferred Stock\nTo the extent we have unpaid accrued dividends on our preferred stock, we cannot pay any dividends on our common shares, pay any consideration to repurchase or otherwise acquire stock of our common stock or redeem any stock of any series of our preferred stock without redeeming all of our outstanding preferred stock in accordance with the governing documentation. Moreover, if we do not pay dividends on any series of preferred stock for six or more periods, then holders of each affected series obtain the right to call a special meeting and elect two members to our board of directors. Consequently, if we do not make a dividend payment on our preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, it could restrict the actions that we may take with respect to our common stock and preferred stock and could affect the composition of our board of directors and, thus, the management of our business. No assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on any series of our preferred stock in the future.\nAll accrued dividends on our preferred stock have been paid through January 31, 2017.\nSee Note 12 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information on our preferred stock.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling interest represents the equity interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries not owned by Drive Shack Inc. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in Drive Shack Inc.'s ownership interest while the Company retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and, upon a gain or loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.\nDrive Shack Inc.'s noncontrolling interest is related to our Traditional Golf business, a portion of which the Company does not own. In October 2016, we exited certain golf properties in which the Company had a noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest associated with the remaining golf property has a carrying value of zero.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) changed due to the following factors (in thousands):\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gains/ Losses on Cash Flow Hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gains / Losses on Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), December, 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized loss on available for sale securities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of net realized/unrealized loss on securities into earnings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of net realized gain on deconsolidation of CDO VI\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification of net realized loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges into earnings\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur GAAP equity changes as our real estate securities portfolio and derivatives are marked to market each quarter, among other factors. The primary causes of mark-to-market changes are changes in interest rates. Net unrealized gains on our real estate securities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily as a result of gains recognized in earnings from the deconsolidation of CDO VI and net unrealized losses on our fixed rate Agency RMBS caused by rising interest rates towards the end of the year ended December 31, 2016. These were partially offset by net losses realized in earnings that were primarily driven by the reclassification of unrealized losses into earnings on Agency RMBS due to the Company's intent to sell these securities.\nSee - Market Considerations\u201d above for a further discussion of recent trends and events affecting our unrealized gains and losses as well as our liquidity.\nCash Flow\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities changed from $(2.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. It changed from $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $(2.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes resulted primarily from the factors described below:\n2016 compared to 2015\n \u2022 Operating cash flows from Traditional Golf increased by $8.5 million primarily due to: (i) the continued growth of the driving range program at public golf properties, (ii) decreased interest expense payments as a result of the golf debt repurchased in August 2015, (iii) increased food and beverage sales due to increased private events and (iv) decreased operating expenses as a result of the termination of certain leased traditional golf properties in 2015. \n \u2022 A decrease of approximately $3.3 million in corporate general and administrative expenses paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to expenses incurred at the end of 2014 that were paid in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the spin-off of New Senior Investment Group Inc. An increase of $1.1 million in general and administrative expenses paid for Entertainment Golf. \n \u2022 A decrease of approximately $1.2 million in interest expense as a result of lowering interest rates associated with the junior subordinated notes payable for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Net cash receipts from our Debt Investments portfolio decreased by $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower interest proceeds as a result of the liquidation CDO VIII and IX in June 2015 and the sale of a real estate related loan in April 2016. \n2015 compared to 2014\n \u2022 Operating cash flows from Traditional Golf increased by $6.9 million primarily due to (i) increased sales of food and beverage from private events, (ii) the introduction of a new driving range program at public golf properties, and (iii) decreased operating expenses as a result of the termination of certain leased golf properties in 2014. \n \u2022 A decrease of approximately $5.6 million in general and administrative expenses paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to fewer transaction related expenses primarily due to the spin-off of New Senior. \n \u2022 Management fees paid decreased approximately $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to a decrease in gross equity as a result of the spin-offs of New Media in February 2014 and New Senior in November 2014 which was partially offset by an increase in gross equity as a result of the public offerings of our common stock in August 2014. \n \u2022 Net cash receipts from CDOs in our Debt Investments portfolio decreased approximately $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to lower interest proceeds from CDO VIII and IX, as a result of pay downs and sales in 2014 and 2015. \n \u2022 Net cash receipts from other debt portfolios in our Debt Investments portfolio increased by approximately $9.1 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $9.8 million of net receipts on our FNMA/FHLMC securities and approximately $1.7 million of receipts from our unencumbered securities and loans, offset by a decrease of approximately $2.4 million in net receipts from the manufactured housing loan portfolios that were sold in May 2014. \n \u2022 Increase of $1.5 million as a result of net cash used from New Media, which was spun-off in February 2014. \n \u2022 Reduction of $64.0 million as a result of the spin-off of New Senior in November 2014. \nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $152.6 million, provided $193.1 million, and provided $319.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Uses of cash flows from investing activities consisted primarily of the investments made in traditional golf properties, entertainment golf venues, real estate securities and senior housing properties. Proceeds from cash flows from investing activities consisted primarily of sale of investments, repayments from loans and securities, settlement of derivatives and return of restricted cash from investing activities.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $243.8 million, used $218.7 million, and used $389.4 million during the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The public offerings of common stock, borrowings under debt obligations, the return of margin deposits under repurchase agreements and derivatives, and deposits received on golf memberships served as the primary sources of cash flow from financing activities. Uses of cash flow from financing activities included the repayment of debt obligations, the repurchase of debt, the contribution of cash to New Media and New Senior upon the spin-offs, deposits made on margin calls related to our repurchase agreements and derivatives, the payment of financing costs, the payment of common and preferred dividends, payments related to the settlement of derivatives, and the payment of costs related to the common stock offerings.\nSee the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described herein.\nInterest Rate, Credit and Spread Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate, credit and spread risk with respect to our investments. These risks are further described in Part II,", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nDrive Shack Inc. is a leading owner and operator of golf-related leisure and entertainment businesses. Drive Shack Inc.'s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol DS.\u201d Drive Shack Inc. is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, or Fortress (the Manager\u201d).\nFor further information relating to Drive Shack Inc.'s business, see Item 1. Business.\u201d\nWe report our business through the following segments: (i) Traditional Golf, (ii) Entertainment Golf, (iii) Debt Investments, and (iv) corporate.\nRevenues attributable to each segment, as restated for previously reported periods, are disclosed below (in thousands).\n\n (A) Excludes $0.6 million of revenue included in discontinued operations related to the sale of commercial real estate. \n (B) Excludes $283.4 million of revenues included in discontinued operations related to senior housing, media and the sale of commercial real estate. \nMarket Considerations\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the development of our Entertainment Golf business, depends to a degree on our ability to monetize our Debt Investments and obtain additional capital. We have not accessed the capital markets since 2014, and rising interest rates or stock market volatility could impair our ability to raise equity capital on attractive terms.\nOur ability to generate income is dependent on, among other factors, our ability to raise capital and finance investments on favorable terms, deploy capital on a timely basis at attractive returns, and exit investments at favorable yields. Market conditions outside of our control, such as interest rates, credit spreads and stock market volatility affect these objectives in a variety of ways.\nTraditional Golf\nWith respect to our Traditional Golf business, trends in consumer discretionary spending as well as climate and weather patterns have a significant impact on the markets in which we operate. Traditional Golf is subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by significant reductions in golf activities as well as revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each year, due to shorter days and colder temperatures. Consequently, a significantly larger portion of our revenue from our Traditional Golf operations is earned in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In addition, severe weather patterns can also negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhile consumer spending in the Traditional Golf industry has generally been declining in recent years, we believe improving economic conditions and improvements in local housing markets has helped and will continue to help drive membership growth and increase the number of golf rounds played. In addition, we believe growth in related industries, including leisure entertainment, can positively impact our traditional golf business.\nDebt Investments\nDuring the year, both short-term and long-term interest rates remained at or near historical lows. We project short- and long-term rates to increase in the future, although the timing of any further increases is uncertain. We have investments in both floating and fixed rate securities and loans, which are affected by interest rates in different ways. We expect that the value of our floating rate assets would not be significantly affected by a change in interest rates (whether an increase or decrease), since the coupon tracks the movement in rates, while the value of fixed rate assets can be negatively affected by rising interest rates. However, in general, rising interest rates are usually indicative of a strengthening economic environment, which could reduce the credit risk of some of our investments. With respect to our fixed rate assets, we believe that the negative impact of rising interest rates could potentially be offset by the positive impact of reduced credit risk.\nCredit spreads also affect the value of our investments in debt securities and loans. Credit spreads decreased or \"tightened,\" marginally during 2015 and 2016, which had a minimal impact on the value of our portfolio. Credit spreads measure the yield relative to a specified benchmark that the market demands on securities and loans based on the credit risk of such assets. The value of our portfolio tends to increase when spreads tighten and to decrease when spreads widen. Credit spreads also affect the cost of financing, with widening spreads tending to increase the cost, and tightening spreads tending to reduce it.\nThe net interest spread of our portfolio of Debt Investments can be impacted by (i) the timing and extent of changes in the composition of our portfolio as a result of purchases and sales of assets or the repayment of debt, repurchase agreements and other\nbonds, the incurrence of new debt, (ii) the yields on new investments, which varies depending on the credit quality of the issuer, and (iii) changes in our estimates of the yields on securities acquired at a discount for credit quality. For instance, the net interest spread of our Debt Investments increases if we sell assets with lower yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale or refinancing) that has a higher interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio (assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio). Conversely, the net interest spread of our portfolio decreases if we sell assets with higher yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale) that has a lower interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio (again, assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio). Management continually monitors market conditions to opportunistically effect purchases and sales of debt investments.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our estimates are based on information available to management at the time of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the result of historical analysis, our understanding and experience of the Company's operations, our knowledge of the industry and market-participant data available to us.\nActual results have historically been in line with management's estimates and judgments used in applying each of the accounting policies described below and management periodically re-evaluates accounting estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates and materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company does not expect our assessments and assumptions below to materially change in the future.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments, estimates and assumptions.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, and only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe VIEs in which we have a significant interest include our CDOs. We do not have the power to direct the relevant activities of CDO V, as a result of an event of default which allows for us to be removed as collateral manager of this CDO and prevents us from purchasing or selling certain collateral within this CDO, and therefore this CDO is not consolidated as of December 31, 2016. In August 2016, the Company settled on a trade to sell $14.8 million face amount of two CDO V securities for total proceeds of $9.9 million (See Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information). As a result of this trade, the Company no longer has an economic interest in CDO V.\nOn March 31, 2016, Drive Shack Inc. sold $11.0 million face amount of NCT 2013-VI Class I-MM-2. As a result of this sale, the Company was no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated CDO VI.\nOur subprime securitizations are also considered VIEs, but we do not control the decisions that most significantly impact their economic performance and no longer receive a significant portion of their returns, and therefore do not consolidate them.\nIn addition, our investments in RMBS and real estate related and other loans may be deemed to be variable interests in VIEs, depending on their structure. We monitor these investments and analyze the potential need to consolidate the related securitization entities pursuant to the VIE consolidation requirements. These analyses require considerable judgment in determining whether an entity is a VIE and determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE since they involve subjective determinations of significance, with respect to both power and economics. The result could be the consolidation of an entity that otherwise would not have been consolidated or the deconsolidation of an entity that otherwise would have been consolidated.\nValuation of Securities\nWe have classified all of our real estate securities as available-for-sale. As such, they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, to the extent impairment losses are considered temporary as described below. Fair value may be based upon broker quotations, counterparty quotations or pricing services quotations, which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications or a good faith estimate thereof and are subject to significant variability based on market conditions, such as interest rates, credit spreads and market liquidity. A significant portion of our securities are currently not traded in active markets and therefore have little or no price transparency. As a result, we have estimated the fair value of these illiquid securities based on internal pricing models rather than the sources described above. The determination of estimated cash flows used in pricing models is inherently subjective and imprecise. Changes in market conditions, as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, could result in a significant and immediate increase or decrease in our book equity. For securities valued with pricing models, these inputs include the discount rate, assumptions relating to prepayments, default rates and loss severities, as well as other variables.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding the fair value of our investments, and respective estimation methodologies, as of December 31, 2016.\nOur securities must be categorized by the level\u201d of inputs used in estimating their fair values. Level 1 would be assets or liabilities valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. We have no Level 1 assets or liabilities. Level 2 would be assets or liabilities valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets, or on other observable\u201d market inputs. Level 3 would be assets or liabilities valued based significantly on unobservable\u201d market inputs. Fair value under GAAP represents an exit price in the normal course of business, not a forced liquidation price. If we were forced to sell assets in a short period to meet liquidity needs, the prices we receive could be substantially less than the recorded fair values.\nWe generally classify non-binding broker and pricing service quotations we receive as Level 3 inputs. Such quotations are quoted prices in generally inactive and illiquid markets for identical or similar securities. These quotations are generally received via email and contain disclaimers which state that they are indicative\u201d and not actionable\u201d - meaning that the party giving the quotation is not bound to actually purchase the security at the quoted price. These quotations are generally based on models prepared by the brokers, and we have little visibility into the inputs they use. Based on quarterly procedures we have performed with respect to quotations received from these brokers, including comparison to the outputs generated from our internal pricing models and transactions we have completed with respect to these securities, as well as on our knowledge and experience of these markets, we have generally determined that these quotes represent a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $627.3 million carrying value of Level 2 assets.\nOur estimation of the fair value of Level 3 assets valued using internal models involves significant judgment. The inputs to our models include discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and severity assumptions. We validate the inputs and outputs of our models by comparing them to available independent third-party market parameters and models for reasonableness, as well as historical performance. We believe the assumptions we use are within the range that a market participant would use and factor in the liquidity conditions currently in the markets. In 2016, the inputs to our models, including discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and severity assumptions, have generally remained consistent with the assumptions used at December 31, 2015.\nFor securities valued with internal models, which have an aggregate fair value of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2016, a 10% unfavorable change in our assumptions would result in the following decreases in such aggregate fair value (in thousands):\n\nA 10% unfavorable change in prepayment rate, default rate and loss severity have no impact on the ABS - Non-Agency RMBS fair value.\nImpairment of Securities and Other Investments\nWe must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities, if any, reflect a decline in value which is other-than-temporary and, if so, write the impaired security down to its fair value through earnings. A decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary if (i) it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a security which was not impaired at acquisition (there is an expected credit loss), or (ii) if we have the intent to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position prior to its anticipated recovery (if any). For the purposes of performing this analysis, we assume the anticipated recovery period is until the respective security's expected maturity. For certain securities which represent beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and non-Agency RMBS acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality for which it was deemed probable, at acquisition, that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments as they come due, an other-than-temporary impairment also will be deemed to have occurred whenever there is a probable adverse change in the timing or amounts of previously projected estimated cash flows.\nTemporary declines in value generally result from changes in market factors, such as market interest rates and credit spreads, or from certain macroeconomic events, including market disruptions and supply changes, which do not directly impact our ability to collect amounts contractually due. We continually evaluate the credit status of each of our securities and the collateral supporting our securities. This evaluation includes a review of the credit of the issuer of the security (if applicable), the credit rating of the security, the key terms of the security (including credit support), debt service coverage and loan to value ratios, the performance of the pool of underlying loans and the estimated value of the collateral supporting such loans, including the effect of local, industry and broader economic trends and factors. These factors include loan default expectations and loss severities, which are analyzed in connection with a particular security's credit support, as well as prepayment rates. These factors are also analyzed in relation to the amount of the unrealized loss and the period elapsed since it was incurred. The result of this evaluation is considered when determining management's estimate of cash flows, particularly with respect to developing the necessary inputs and assumptions. Each security is impacted by different factors and in different ways; generally the more negative factors which are identified with respect to a given security, the more likely we are to determine that we do not expect to receive all contractual payments when due with respect to that security. Significant judgment is required in this analysis.\nWe generally do not depend on credit ratings in underwriting our securities, either at acquisition or on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had no securities that had been downgraded during 2016. As mentioned above, a credit rating downgrade is one factor that we monitor and consider in our analysis regarding other-than-temporary impairment, but it is not determinative. Our securities generally benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or equity or other forms of credit support. Therefore, credit rating downgrades, even to the extent they relate to an expectation that a securitization we have invested in, on an overall basis, has credit issues, may not ultimately impact cash flow estimates for the class of securities in which we are invested.\nFurthermore, the analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in an unrealized loss position prior to an expected recovery in value (if any), the amount of such expected required sales, and the projected identification of which securities would be sold is also subject to significant judgment.\nWe evaluate our other investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. The evaluation of recoverability is based on management's assessment of the financial condition and near term prospects of the commercial real estate project, the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, availability and cost of financing, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management's assumptions, the values estimated by management in its recoverability analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future.\nRevenue Recognition on Securities\nIncome on these securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. For securities that are not acquired at a discount for credit quality, these assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts (which may be subject to prepayments and defaults). For securities acquired at a discount for credit quality and with respect to which management has determined at acquisition that it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, these assumptions also include expected losses. For these securities, we recognize the excess of all expected cash flows over our investment in the securities, referred to as accretable yield, as Interest Income on a loss-adjusted yield basis. The loss adjusted yield is determined based on an evaluation of the credit status of securities, as described in connection with the analysis of impairment above. The excess of total contractual cash flows over the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference and is not recognized as income. The assumptions that impact income recognition are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular\nsecurity, actual historical data, and market changes. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events, and economic and market conditions, which may alter the assumptions.\nValuation of Derivatives\nOur derivative instruments are carried at fair value which is based on counterparty quotations and pricing services. The Company reports the fair value of derivative instruments gross of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements. To the extent they qualify as cash flow hedges, net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income; otherwise, the net unrealized gains and losses are reported currently in other income. To the extent they qualify as fair value hedges, net unrealized gains or losses on both the derivative and the related portion of the hedged item are reported currently in income. Fair values of such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as the securities discussed above, including counterparty credit risk. The results of such variability, the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the extent to which a forecasted hedged transaction remains probable of occurring, could result in a significant increase or decrease in our GAAP equity and/or earnings.\nLoans\nWe invest in loans, including, but not limited to, real estate related and other loans, residential mortgage loans and subprime mortgage loans. Loans for which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified as held-for-investment. Loans for which we do not have the intent or the ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified as held-for-sale. Loans are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of any unamortized discount (or gross of any unamortized premium) and an allowance for loan losses. We determine at acquisition whether loans will be aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics (credit quality, loan type, and date of origination or acquisition); loans aggregated into pools are accounted for as if each pool were a single loan. We also evaluate our loans at acquisition for evidence of credit quality deterioration. Loans for which we determine that it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments at acquisition are categorized as loans acquired at a discount for credit quality.\nRevenue Recognition on Loans Held for Sale\nReal estate related, commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans that are considered held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value determined on either an individual method basis, or in the aggregate for pools of similar loans. Interest income is recognized based on the loan's coupon rate to the extent management believes it is collectible. Purchase discounts are not amortized as interest income during the period the loan is held for sale, except when a pay down or sale has happened in the period. Similarly, for loans acquired at a discount for credit quality, accretable yield is not recorded as interest income during the period the loan is held for sale. A change in the market value of the loan, to the extent that the value is not above the average cost basis, is recorded in Valuation Allowance. A rollforward of the allowance is included in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAcquisition Accounting\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The accounting for acquisitions requires the identification and measurement of all acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired, management uses information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, leasing activities and independent appraisals. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgment and estimation.\nImpairment of Investments in Real Estate\nReal estate and long-lived assets are tested for potential impairment when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment is determined to have occurred if the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated is less than the carrying value of an asset. The impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the fair value. We may use assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business projections, expected growth rates, discount rates, and tax rates. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions, interest rates, and other market data. Many of the factors used in these assumptions and estimates are outside the control of management, and can change in future periods.\nIntangible Assets\nWe assess the potential impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We perform our impairment test by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe assess the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets, or other appropriate grouping of assets, may not be fully recoverable. The assessment of recoverability is based on comparing management's estimates of the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying asset, or other appropriate grouping of assets, to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment existed at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors leading to impairment include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nMembership Deposit Liabilities\nIn our Traditional Golf business, private country club members generally pay an advance initiation fee deposit upon their acceptance as a member to the respective country club. Initiation fee deposits are refundable 30 years after the date of acceptance as a member. The difference between the initiation fee deposit paid by the member and the present value of the refund obligation is deferred and recognized into revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the expected life of an active membership, which is estimated to be seven years. The present value of the refund obligation is recorded as a membership deposit liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accretes over a 30-year nonrefundable term using the effective interest method. This accretion is recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The determination of the estimated average expected life of an active membership is based on company-specific historical data and involves significant judgment and estimation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to Part II, Item 8.

We have the ability to publicly or privately issue common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities and warrants. Our debt obligations are generally secured directly by our investment assets, except for the junior subordinated notes payable.\nSources of Liquidity and Uses of Capital\nAs of the date of this filing, we believe we have sufficient liquid assets, which include unrestricted cash, to satisfy all of our short-term recourse liabilities. Our junior subordinated notes payable are long-term obligations. With respect to the next 12 months, we expect that our cash on hand combined with our other primary sources of funds for liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs with respect to our current portfolio, including related financings, capital expenditures for our Traditional and Entertainment golf businesses, working capital needs, potential margin calls and operating expenses. In addition, we may have additional cash requirements with respect to incremental investments related to our Traditional Golf business and executing our strategic objectives for our Entertainment Golf business. In addition to our available cash, we may elect to meet the cash requirements of these incremental investments through proceeds from the monetization of our assets or from additional borrowings or equity offerings. While it is inherently more difficult to forecast beyond the next 12 months, we currently expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, specifically the repayment of our recourse debt obligations, through our cash on hand and, if needed, additional borrowings, proceeds from equity offerings and the liquidation or refinancing of our assets. We continually monitor market conditions for financing opportunities, and at any given time, we may enter into or pursue one or more of the transactions described above.\nThese short-term and long-term expectations are forward-looking and subject to a number of uncertainties and assumptions, which are described below under -Factors That Could Impact Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\u201d as well as Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d If our assumptions about our liquidity prove to be incorrect, we could be subject to a shortfall in liquidity in the future, and this shortfall may occur rapidly and with little or no notice, which would limit our ability to address the shortfall on a timely basis.\nCash flows provided by operations constitute a critical component of our liquidity. Essentially, our cash flows provided by operations is equal to (i) net cash flows received from our Traditional Golf business, plus (ii) the net cash flows from our Debt Investments that are not subject to mandatory debt repayment, including principal and sales proceeds, less (iii) traditional golf operating expenses, management fees, professional fees and insurance, less (iv) interest on the junior subordinated notes payable and less (v) preferred dividends.\nOur cash flows provided by operations differs from our net income (loss) due to these primary factors: (i) accretion of discount or premium on our real estate securities and loans (including the accrual of interest payable at maturity) and deferred financing costs, (ii) amortization of favorable and unfavorable leasehold intangibles\u200e from the acquisition of the Traditional Golf business in December 2013, (iii) accretion of the golf membership deposit liabilities in interest expense, (iv) amortization of prepaid golf membership dues, (v) gains and losses from sales of assets, (vi) the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our loan assets, as well as other-than-temporary impairment on our securities, Traditional Golf business and other investments, (vii) unrealized gains or losses on our investments, (viii) non-cash gains or losses associated with our early extinguishment of debt, (ix) non-cash gains on deconsolidation, and (x) depreciation and amortization on our investments. Proceeds from the sale of assets which serve as collateral for our CDO financings, including gains thereon, are required to be retained in the CDO structure until the related bonds are retired and are, therefore, not available to fund current cash needs outside of these structures.\nThe sources of our distributions are net cash provided by operating activities, net cash provided by investing activities and cash equivalents as they represent the return on our portfolio of investments in real estate debt and golf related real estate and operations. The Company has paid common dividends of $32.0 million and preferred dividends of $5.6 million in fiscal year 2016. However, our board of directors elected not to pay a common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2017 to retain capital for growth. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 million, net cash used in investing activities of $152.6 million, net cash provided by financing activities of $243.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of $140.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Prior to termination of our REIT election, we made distributions of a minimum of 90% of our taxable income each year in order to maintain our REIT status. As a result of our revocation of REIT election, effective January 1, 2017, we are no longer subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs. The timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our board of directors, which considers our earnings, financial performance and condition, debt service obligations and applicable debt covenants, tax considerations, as well as capital expenditure requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nUpdate on Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\nCash - As of December 31, 2016, we had $140.1 million of available cash, including $18.3 million of working capital for the Traditional Golf business. On December 7, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $9.4 million which was paid on January 31, 2017.\nCertain details regarding our liquidity, current financings and capital obligations as of February 22, 2017 are set forth below:\nMargin Exposure and Recourse Financings - We have margin exposure on a $595.4 million repurchase agreements related to the financing of FNMA/FHLMC securities. The mezzanine note payable was repaid in April 2016 and golf loans repurchase agreement was repaid in June 2016. See Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nThe following table compares our recourse financings excluding the junior subordinated notes (in thousands):\n\nOur liquidity, available capital resources and capital obligations could change rapidly due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Set forth below is a discussion of some of the factors that could impact our liquidity, available capital resources and capital obligations.\nFactors That Could Impact Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations\nWe refer readers to our discussions in other sections of this report for the following information:\n \u2022 For a further discussion of recent trends and events affecting our liquidity, see - Market Considerations\u201d above; \n \u2022 As described above, under - Update on Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Obligations,\u201d we are subject to margin calls in connection with our repurchase agreements; \n \u2022 As described above, under - Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Capital,\u201d we may be subject to capital obligations associated with our Traditional and Entertainment Golf businesses; \n \u2022 Our remaining investments, generally financed with short-term debt or short-term repurchase agreements, are also subject to refinancing risk upon the maturity of the related debt. See - Debt Obligations\u201d below; and \n \u2022 For a further discussion of a number of risks that could affect our liquidity, access to capital resources and our capital obligations, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above. \nIn addition to the information referenced above, the following factors could affect our liquidity, access to capital resources and our capital obligations related to our Traditional and Entertainment Golf businesses. As such, if their outcomes do not fall within our expectations, changes in these factors could negatively affect our liquidity.\n \u2022 Access to Financing from Counterparties - Decisions by investors, counterparties and lenders to enter into transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors, such as our historical and projected financial performance, compliance with the terms of our current credit and derivative arrangements, industry and market trends, the availability of capital and our investors', counterparties' and lenders' policies and rates applicable thereto, and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities. Our business strategy is dependent upon our investments at rates that provide a positive net spread. \n \u2022 Impact of Expected Repayment or Forecasted Sale on Cash Flows - The timing of and proceeds from the repayment or sale of certain investments may be different than expected or may not occur as expected. Proceeds from sales of assets in the current illiquid market environment are unpredictable and may vary materially from their estimated fair value and their carrying value.  Debt Obligations\nCertain of the debt obligations are obligations of our consolidated subsidiaries which own the related collateral. In some cases, such collateral is not available to other creditors of ours.\nThe financing of our Traditional Golf business contain various customary loan covenants, including certain coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all of the covenants in these financings as of December 31, 2016. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had complied with the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors that limit total leverage.\nSee Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information related to our debt obligations and contractual maturities as of December 31, 2016.\nRepurchase Agreements\nThe following table provides additional information regarding short-term borrowings (dollars in thousands). The outstanding short-term borrowings were used to finance certain of our investments in FNMA/FHLMC securities and to finance the acquisition of Golf debt. All of the repurchase agreements have full recourse to Drive Shack Inc.\n\nO/S - Outstanding\nIn January 2014, we sold $503.0 million face amount of the FNMA/FHLMC securities for total proceeds of $532.2 million and repaid $516.1 million of repurchase agreements. We also financed additional repurchased CDO debt with $30.8 million of repurchase agreements. In June 2014, we repaid $60.0 million of repurchase agreements associated with our linked transaction as the underlying assets were paid off. Additionally, in June 2014 we financed previously repurchased CDO debt with $26.3 million of repurchase agreements. In July 2014, we sold $37.4 million face amount of residential mortgage loans for total proceeds of $34.7 million and repaid $23.0 million of repurchase agreements associated with these loans.\nSee Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about the FNMA/FHLMC repurchase agreement activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about the CDO securities and Golf Loans repurchase agreement activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe weighted average differences between the fair value of the assets and the face amount of financing of the FNMA/FHLMC repurchase agreements was 4% as of December 31, 2016.\nSubprime Securitization\nIn March 2006, we acquired a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans ( Subprime Portfolio I\u201d) for $1.50 billion. In April 2006, Newcastle Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-1 ( Securitization Trust 2006\u201d) closed on a securitization of Subprime Portfolio I. We do not consolidate Securitization Trust 2006. We sold Subprime Portfolio I to Securitization Trust 2006, which issued $1.45 billion of notes with a stated maturity of March 2036. We, as holder of the equity of Securitization Trust 2006, have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of Subprime Portfolio I is equal to or less than 20% of such balance at the date of the transfer. The transaction between us and Securitization Trust 2006 qualified as a sale for accounting purposes. However, 20% of the loans which are subject to a call option by us, were not treated as being sold. Following the securitization, we held the following interests in Subprime Portfolio I: (i) the equity of Securitization Trust 2006, (ii) the retained notes, and (iii) subprime mortgage loans subject to call option and related financing in the amount of 100% of such loans (we note that this interest is non-economic if we do not exercise the option, meaning that it has no impact on us).\nIn March 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans ( Subprime Portfolio II\u201d) with up to $1.7 billion of unpaid principal balance. In July 2007, Newcastle Mortgage Securities Trust 2007-1 ( Securitization Trust 2007\u201d) closed on a securitization of Subprime Portfolio II. As a result of the repurchase of delinquent loans by the seller, as well as borrower repayments, the unpaid principal balance of the portfolio upon securitization was $1.1 billion. We do not consolidate Securitization Trust 2007. We sold Subprime Portfolio II to Securitization Trust 2007, which issued $1.0 billion of notes with a stated maturity of April 2037. We, as holder of the equity of Securitization Trust 2007, have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of Subprime Portfolio II is equal to or less than 10% of such balance at the date of the transfer. The transaction between us and Securitization Trust 2007 qualified as a sale for accounting purposes. However, 10% of the loans which are subject to a call option by us were not treated as being sold. Following the securitization, we held the following interests in Subprime Portfolio II: (i) the equity of Securitization Trust 2007, (ii) the retained notes, and (iii) subprime mortgage loans subject to call option and related financing in the amount of 100% of such loans (we note that this interest is non-economic, meaning that if we do not exercise the option it has no impact on us).\nWe have no obligation to repurchase any loans from either of our subprime securitizations. Therefore, it is expected that our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount of our retained interests in the securitization entities, as described above. A subsidiary of Drive Shack Inc. gave limited representations and warranties with respect to Subprime Portfolio II; however, it has no assets and does not have recourse to the Company's assets.\nOn December 29, 2016, the Company sold the call option to a third party and, as a result of this sale, the loans subject to call option and corresponding financing are no longer reported on Drive Shack Inc.'s Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 6 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nSubordinated Notes Payable\nThe following table presents certain information regarding the junior subordinated notes (dollars in thousands).\n\n\nGolf Credit Facilities and Repurchase Agreement\nSee Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information about our golf credit facilities and repurchase agreement.\nEquity\nCommon Stock\nSee Note 12 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information on shares of our common stock issued since 2014.\nCommon Dividends Paid\n\n (A) On February 13, 2014, we completed the spin-off of New Media through a distribution of shares valued at $5.34 per Drive Shack Inc. share (calculated by multiplying the fair market value of $73.80 per New Media share by the spin-off conversion ratio of 0.0722). On November 6, 2014, we completed the spin-off of New Senior through a distribution of shares valued at $18.02 per share.  See Note 12 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for detailed information on our options outstanding and option plans.\nPreferred Stock\nTo the extent we have unpaid accrued dividends on our preferred stock, we cannot pay any dividends on our common shares, pay any consideration to repurchase or otherwise acquire stock of our common stock or redeem any stock of any series of our preferred stock without redeeming all of our outstanding preferred stock in accordance with the governing documentation. Moreover, if we do not pay dividends on any series of preferred stock for six or more periods, then holders of each affected series obtain the right to call a special meeting and elect two members to our board of directors. Consequently, if we do not make a dividend payment on our preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, it could restrict the actions that we may take with respect to our common stock and preferred stock and could affect the composition of our board of directors and, thus, the management of our business. No assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on any series of our preferred stock in the future.\nAll accrued dividends on our preferred stock have been paid through January 31, 2017.\nSee Note 12 to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information on our preferred stock.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling interest represents the equity interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries not owned by Drive Shack Inc. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in Drive Shack Inc.'s ownership interest while the Company retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and, upon a gain or loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.\nDrive Shack Inc.'s noncontrolling interest is related to our Traditional Golf business, a portion of which the Company does not own. In October 2016, we exited certain golf properties in which the Company had a noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest associated with the remaining golf property has a carrying value of zero.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) changed due to the following factors (in thousands):\n\nOur GAAP equity changes as our real estate securities portfolio and derivatives are marked to market each quarter, among other factors. The primary causes of mark-to-market changes are changes in interest rates. Net unrealized gains on our real estate securities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily as a result of gains recognized in earnings from the deconsolidation of CDO VI and net unrealized losses on our fixed rate Agency RMBS caused by rising interest rates towards the end of the year ended December 31, 2016. These were partially offset by net losses realized in earnings that were primarily driven by the reclassification of unrealized losses into earnings on Agency RMBS due to the Company's intent to sell these securities.\nSee - Market Considerations\u201d above for a further discussion of recent trends and events affecting our unrealized gains and losses as well as our liquidity.\nCash Flow\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities changed from $(2.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. It changed from $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $(2.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes resulted primarily from the factors described below:\n2016 compared to 2015\n \u2022 Operating cash flows from Traditional Golf increased by $8.5 million primarily due to: (i) the continued growth of the driving range program at public golf properties, (ii) decreased interest expense payments as a result of the golf debt repurchased in August 2015, (iii) increased food and beverage sales due to increased private events and (iv) decreased operating expenses as a result of the termination of certain leased traditional golf properties in 2015. \n \u2022 A decrease of approximately $3.3 million in corporate general and administrative expenses paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to expenses incurred at the end of 2014 that were paid in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the spin-off of New Senior Investment Group Inc. An increase of $1.1 million in general and administrative expenses paid for Entertainment Golf. \n \u2022 A decrease of approximately $1.2 million in interest expense as a result of lowering interest rates associated with the junior subordinated notes payable for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Net cash receipts from our Debt Investments portfolio decreased by $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower interest proceeds as a result of the liquidation CDO VIII and IX in June 2015 and the sale of a real estate related loan in April 2016. \n2015 compared to 2014\n \u2022 Operating cash flows from Traditional Golf increased by $6.9 million primarily due to (i) increased sales of food and beverage from private events, (ii) the introduction of a new driving range program at public golf properties, and (iii) decreased operating expenses as a result of the termination of certain leased golf properties in 2014. \n \u2022 A decrease of approximately $5.6 million in general and administrative expenses paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to fewer transaction related expenses primarily due to the spin-off of New Senior. \n \u2022 Management fees paid decreased approximately $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to a decrease in gross equity as a result of the spin-offs of New Media in February 2014 and New Senior in November 2014 which was partially offset by an increase in gross equity as a result of the public offerings of our common stock in August 2014. \n \u2022 Net cash receipts from CDOs in our Debt Investments portfolio decreased approximately $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to lower interest proceeds from CDO VIII and IX, as a result of pay downs and sales in 2014 and 2015. \n \u2022 Net cash receipts from other debt portfolios in our Debt Investments portfolio increased by approximately $9.1 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $9.8 million of net receipts on our FNMA/FHLMC securities and approximately $1.7 million of receipts from our unencumbered securities and loans, offset by a decrease of approximately $2.4 million in net receipts from the manufactured housing loan portfolios that were sold in May 2014. \n \u2022 Increase of $1.5 million as a result of net cash used from New Media, which was spun-off in February 2014. \n \u2022 Reduction of $64.0 million as a result of the spin-off of New Senior in November 2014. \nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $152.6 million, provided $193.1 million, and provided $319.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Uses of cash flows from investing activities consisted primarily of the investments made in traditional golf properties, entertainment golf venues, real estate securities and senior housing properties. Proceeds from cash flows from investing activities consisted primarily of sale of investments, repayments from loans and securities, settlement of derivatives and return of restricted cash from investing activities.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $243.8 million, used $218.7 million, and used $389.4 million during the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The public offerings of common stock, borrowings under debt obligations, the return of margin deposits under repurchase agreements and derivatives, and deposits received on golf memberships served as the primary sources of cash flow from financing activities. Uses of cash flow from financing activities included the repayment of debt obligations, the repurchase of debt, the contribution of cash to New Media and New Senior upon the spin-offs, deposits made on margin calls related to our repurchase agreements and derivatives, the payment of financing costs, the payment of common and preferred dividends, payments related to the settlement of derivatives, and the payment of costs related to the common stock offerings.\nSee the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described herein.\nInterest Rate, Credit and Spread Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate, credit and spread risk with respect to our investments. These risks are further described in Part II,", "item_7_tables": "Table 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

report:\n\n- Drive Shack Inc. operates businesses in traditional golf, entertainment golf, debt investments, and corporate segments. Revenues were $298.9 million in 2016 compared to $295.9 million in 2015, an increase of 1%. \n\n- Net income was $77.5 million in 2016 compared to $21.3 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $82.1 million gain on deconsolidation of a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) in 2016.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $3.4 million in 2016 compared to $(2.6) million in 2015. The improvement was mainly due to increased cash flow from traditional golf operations.\n\n- Investing activities used $152.6 million in cash in 2016 compared to providing $193.1 million in 2015, primarily due to investments in traditional golf properties and entertainment golf venues in 2016. \n\n- Financing activities provided $243.8 million in cash in 2016 compared to using $218.7 million in 2015. The change was mainly due to public offerings of common stock and borrowings in 2016.\n\n- The company has exposure to interest rate, credit and spread risk on its investments. It actively monitors and manages these risks.\n\n- Liquidity remains sufficient to meet the company's obligations. The company has been focused on growing its entertainment golf business.\n\nIn summary, Drive Shack improved its operating cash flow and liquidity in 2016 through debt and equity financing, while continuing to invest in its core golf businesses. The large gain on debt extinguishment boosted net income for the year."}
