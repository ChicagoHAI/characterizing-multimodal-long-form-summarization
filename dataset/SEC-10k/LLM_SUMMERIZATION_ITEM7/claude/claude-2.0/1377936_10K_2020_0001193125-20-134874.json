We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law or SEC rule or regulation. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d). Our investment objective is to create attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income and long-term capital appreciation from our investments. We invest primarily in senior and unitranche leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies having earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) of between $2 million and $50 million, both through direct lending and through participation in loan syndicates. We may also invest up to 30.0% of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in distressed debt, which may include securities of companies in bankruptcy, foreign debt, private equity, securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation funds. Although we have no current intention to do so, to the extent we invest in private equity funds, we will limit our investments in entities that are excluded from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which includes private equity funds, to no more than 15.0% of its net assets. We have elected and qualified to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nCorporate History\nWe commenced operations, at the time known as GSC Investment Corp., on March 23, 2007 and completed an initial public offering of shares of common stock on March 28, 2007. Prior to July 30, 2010, we were externally managed and advised by GSCP (NJ), L.P., an entity affiliated with GSC Group, Inc. In connection with the consummation of a recapitalization transaction on July 30, 2010, as described below we engaged Saratoga Investment Advisors (\u201cSIA\u201d) to replace GSCP (NJ), L.P. as our investment adviser and changed our name to Saratoga Investment Corp.\nAs a result of the event of default under a revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank we previously had in place, in December 2008 we engaged the investment banking firm of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company to evaluate strategic transaction opportunities and consider alternatives for us. On April 14, 2010, GSC Investment Corp. entered into a stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates and an assignment, assumption and novation agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, pursuant to which GSC Investment Corp. assumed certain rights and obligations of Saratoga Investment Advisors under a debt commitment letter Saratoga Investment Advisors received from Madison Capital Funding LLC, which indicated Madison Capital Funding's willingness to provide GSC Investment Corp. with a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In addition, GSC Investment Corp. and GSCP (NJ), L.P. entered into a termination and release agreement, to be effective as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which GSCP (NJ), L.P., among other things, agreed to waive any and all accrued and unpaid deferred incentive management fees up to and as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement but continued to be entitled to receive the base management fees earned through the date of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement.\nOn July 30, 2010, the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates were completed, the private sale of 986,842 shares of our common stock for $15.0 million in aggregate purchase price to Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates closed, the Company entered into the Credit Facility, and the Company began doing business as Saratoga Investment Corp.\nWe used the net proceeds from the private sale transaction and a portion of the funds available to us under the Credit Facility to pay the full amount of principal and accrued interest, including default interest, outstanding under our revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank. The revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank was terminated in connection with our payment of all amounts outstanding thereunder on July 30, 2010.\nOn August 12, 2010, we effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse\nstock split, every ten shares of our common stock were converted into one share of our common stock. Any fractional shares received as a result of the reverse stock split were redeemed for cash. The total cash payment in lieu of shares was $230. Immediately after the reverse stock split, we had 2,680,842 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nIn January 2011, we registered for public resale of the 986,842 shares of our common stock issued to Saratoga Investment\nAdvisors and certain of its affiliates.\nOn March 28, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC, LP (\u201cSBIC LP\u201d), received an SBIC license from the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). On August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP (\u201cSBIC II LP\u201d), also received an SBIC license from the SBA.\nIn May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $46.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters' full exercise of their overallotment option. The 2020 Notes were listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAQ\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share. The 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017.\nOn May 29, 2015, we entered into a Debt Distribution Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes through an At-the-Market (\u201cATM\u201d) offering. Prior to the 2020 Notes being redeemed in full, the Company sold 539,725 bonds with a principal of $13.5 million at an average price of $25.31 for aggregate net proceeds of $13.4 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn December 21, 2016, we issued $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $71.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $2.3 million and offering costs of approximately $0.5 million. The issuance included the exercise of substantially all of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $9.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes within 30 days. The 2023 Notes were listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAB\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes.\nOn March 16, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $30.0 million of our common stock through an ATM offering. Subsequent to this, BB&T Capital Markets and B. Riley FBR, Inc. were also added to the agreement. On July 9, 2019, the amount of the common stock to be offered through this offering was increased to $70.0 million, and on October 8, 2019, the amount of the common stock to be offered was increased to $130.0 million. As of February 29, 2020, the Company sold 3,922,018 shares for gross proceeds of $97.1 million at an average price of $24.77 for aggregate net proceeds of $95.9 million (net of transaction costs). For the year ended February 29, 2020, the Company sold 3,427,346 shares for gross proceeds of $85.9 million at an average price of $25.06 for aggregate net proceeds of $84.7 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn July 13, 2018, the Company issued 1,150,000 shares of its common stock priced at $25.00 per share (par value $0.001 per share) at an aggregate total of $28.75 million. The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.15 million and offering costs of approximately $0.2 million, amounted to approximately $27.4 million. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 172,500 shares of its common stock, which was not exercised.\nOn August 7, 2018, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1, Ltd. (\u201cSaratoga CLO\u201d), pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse may borrow from time to time up to $20 million from us in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, which expired on February 7, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 28, 2019, the maximum amount invested by us in the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan amounted to $20.0 million.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% fixed-rate notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $38.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.3 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.3 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest on the 2025 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, at a rate of 6.25% per year, beginning November 30, 2018. The 2025 Notes mature on August 31, 2025 and commencing August 31, 2021, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. Financing costs of $1.6 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes.\nOn December 14, 2018, the Company completed the third refinancing of the Saratoga CLO (the \u201c2013-1 Reset CLO Notes\u201d). This refinancing, among other things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. In addition to and as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO has also been upsized from $300 million in assets to approximately $500 million. As part of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 Notes tranche and $7.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing $4.5 million of Class F notes and $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan were repaid.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company completed a re-opening and up-sizing of its existing 2025 Notes by issuing an additional $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of $19.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.6 million and discount of $0.2 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.2 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest rate, interest payment dates and maturity remain unchanged from the existing 2025 Notes issued in August 2018. The net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. The financing costs and discount of $1.0 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes. At February 29, 2020, the total 2025 Notes outstanding was $60.0 million. The 2025 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAF\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share.\nOn August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP (\u201cSBIC II LP\u201d), also received an SBIC license from the SBA. The new license will provide up to $175.0 million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA debentures.\nOn February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time to time up to $20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan, which expires on August 20, 2021, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%.\nCOVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains and adversely impacting a number of industries. The outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risks with respect to the underlying value of the Company's portfolio companies, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, such as the potential negative impact to financing arrangements, company decisions to delay, defer and/or modify the character of dividends in order to preserve liquidity, increased costs of operations, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy.\nWe have evaluated subsequent events from February 29, 2020 through May 6, 2020. However, as the discussion in this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year end February 29, 2020, the analysis contained herein may not fully account for impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, for example, as of February 29, 2020, the Company valued its portfolio investments in conformity with U.S. GAAP based on the facts and circumstances known by the Company at that time, or reasonably expected to be known at that time. Due to the overall volatility that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused during the months that followed our February 29, 2020 valuation, any valuations conducted now or in the future in conformity with U.S. GAAP could result in a lower fair value of our portfolio. The potential impact to our results going forward will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its financial condition and results of operations will be affected at this time.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition and the recognition of capital gains incentive fee expense as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.\nInvestment Valuation\nThe Company accounts for its investments at fair value in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the Company to assume that its investments are to be sold or its liabilities are to be transferred at the balance sheet date in the principal market to independent market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third-party pricing services and market makers subject to any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant events affecting the value of these investments. We value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value as approved, in good faith, by our board of directors based on input from Saratoga Investment Advisors, the audit committee of our board of directors and a third party independent valuation firm. Determinations of fair value may involve subjective judgments and estimates. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors.\nWe undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available, as described below:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Each investment is initially valued by the responsible investment professionals of Saratoga Investment Advisors and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> An independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors independently reviews a selection of these preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment for which market quotes are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least once each fiscal year. We use a third-party independent valuation firm to value our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and the Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of the Saratoga CLOs every quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, all our investments are subject to the following valuation process:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves each preliminary valuation and Saratoga Investment Advisors and an independent valuation firm (if applicable) will supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Our board of directors discusses the valuations and approves the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of Saratoga Investment Advisors, independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment in Saratoga CLO is carried at fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and comparable yields for equity interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO, when available, as determined by SIA and recommended to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flow models, or an appropriate substitute, to form the basis for the valuation of our investment in Saratoga CLO. The models use a set of assumptions including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rate and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The assumptions are based on available market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates. We use the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows) to perform a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash flows to determine a valuation for our investment in Saratoga CLO.\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Discounts and premiums on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the life of the respective investment using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as a reduction in principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nPayment-in-Kind Interest\nThe Company holds debt and preferred equity investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest provision. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing PIK interest if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains, if any, on equity interests that we may acquire. We expect our debt investments, whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt, to have terms of up to ten years, and to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our debt or preferred equity investments may provide for a portion or all of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned. We may also invest in preferred equity or common equity securities that pay dividends on a current basis.\nOn January 22, 2008, we entered into a collateral management agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced in October 2013 with its reinvestment period extended to October 2016. On November 15, 2016, we completed a second refinancing of the Saratoga CLO with its reinvestment period extended to October 2018.\nOn August 7, 2018, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement, CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse, Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse may borrow from time to time up to $20 million from us in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, which expires on February 7, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 28, 2019, the maximum amount invested by us in the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan amounted to $20.0 million.\nOn December 14, 2018, we completed a third refinancing and upsize of the Saratoga CLO. The third Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity date to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. Following this refinancing, the Saratoga CLO portfolio increased from approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount to approximately $500.0 million of predominantly senior secured first lien term loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, we invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO and also purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 and $7.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 notes tranches at par, with a coupon of LIBOR plus 8.75% and LIBOR plus 10.00%, respectively. As part of this refinancing, we also redeemed our existing $4.5 million aggregate amount of the Class F notes tranche at par and the $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan was repaid.\nOn February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time to time up to $20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan, which expires on August 20, 2021, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 29, 2020, the maximum amount invested by us in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 amounted to $2.5 million. As of February 29, 2020, the fair value of our investment in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 was $2.2 million.\nThe Saratoga CLO remains effectively 100% owned and managed by Saratoga Investment Corp. We receive a base management fee of 0.10% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.40% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO's assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds. Prior to the second refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Amended CLO Notes, we received a base management fee of 0.25% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.25% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO's assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds.\nFollowing the third refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, we are no longer entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 20.0% of excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater than 12.0%.\nInterest income on our investment in Saratoga CLO is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (\u201cASC 325-40\u201d), based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed.\nASC 606\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In May 2016, ASU 2016-12 amended ASU 2014-09 and deferred the effective period for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management has concluded that the majority of its revenues associated with financial instruments are scoped out of ASC 606, and has concluded that the only significant impact relates to the timing of the recognition of the CLO incentive fee income. We adopted ASC 606 under the modified retrospective approach using the practical expedient provided for, therefore the presentation of prior periods has not been adjusted.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of investment advisory and management fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance, fees paid to independent directors and administrator expenses, including our allocable portion of our administrator's overhead. Our investment advisory and management fees compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments.

Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive fee. Since the hurdle rate was based on net assets, a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted in an incentive fee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> A fee, payable at the end of each fiscal year, equal to 20.0% of our net realized capital gains, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, in each case on a cumulative basis on each investment in the Company's portfolio, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid to the investment adviser through such date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We deferred cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our former investment adviser if, during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) (before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period) was less than 7.5% of our net assets at the beginning of such period. These calculations were appropriately pro-rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period. Such incentive fee would become payable on the next date on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment advisory and management agreement. We commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended August 31, 2007 and continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended May 31, 2010. As of July 30, 2010, the date on which GSCP (NJ), L.P. ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator, we owed GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 million in fees for services previously provided to us; of which $0.3 million has been paid by us. GSCP (NJ), L.P. agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining $2.6 million in connection with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates described elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe terms of the investment advisory and management agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, our current investment adviser, are substantially similar to the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement we had entered into with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser, except for the following material distinctions in the fee terms:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The capital gains portion of the incentive fee was reset with respect to gains and losses from May 31, 2010, and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors and, as a result, Saratoga Investment Advisors will be entitled to 20.0% of net gains that arise after May 31, 2010. In addition, the cost basis for computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 equal the fair value of such investment as of such date. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P., the capital gains fee was calculated from March 21, 2007, and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Under the \u201ccatch up\u201d provision, 100.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeds 1.875% but is less than or equal to 2.344% in any fiscal quarter is payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors. This will enable Saratoga Investment Advisors to receive 20.0% of all net investment income as such amount approaches 2.344% in any quarter, and Saratoga Investment Advisors will receive 20.0% of any additional net investment income. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P. only received 20.0% of the excess net investment income over 1.875%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than 7.5% for the preceding four fiscal quarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Gains Incentive Fee\nThe Company records an expense accrual relating to the capital gains incentive fee payable by the Company to its Manager when the unrealized gains on its investments exceed all realized capital losses on its investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Manager if the Company were to liquidate its investment portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to the Company's Manager related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d). The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. Management has assessed these changes and does not believe they would have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\nSEC Disclosure Update and Simplification\nIn March 2019, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10618, Fast Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, amending certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements and to provide for a consistent set of rules to govern incorporating information by reference and hyperlinking, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. The Company has adopted the final rule, as applicable under SEC Release No. 33-10618 and determined the effect of the adoption of the simplification rules on financial statements will be limited to the modification and removal of certain disclosures.\nPortfolio and investment activity\nInvestment Portfolio Overview\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 29,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of investments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of portfolio companies(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment per portfolio company(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 11.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment size(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average maturity(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 yrs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6yrs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5yrs </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of industries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing or delinquent investments (fair value)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate debt (% of interest earning portfolio)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.7(6.8 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.7(16.3 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82.5(26.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate debt (weighted average current coupon)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate debt (% of interest earning portfolio)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404.4(93.2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>285.0(83.7 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229.3(73.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate debt (weighted average current spread over\nLIBOR)(3)(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td> At February 29, 2020, excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of Saratoga CLO and loan to Saratoga Investment Corp.

This increase was primarily due to the increase in investment in Easy Ice, LLC, which primarily generated PIK interest income. The Company sold its interest in Easy Ice, LLC during the year ended February 29, 2020.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, total PIK income was $4.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively.

For the year ended February 28, 2019, total operating expenses increased $3.5 million, or 13.6% compared to the year ended February 28, 2018.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding borrowings of the 2025 Notes, partially offset by a decrease in the average outstanding borrowings of the 2023 Notes, which were redeemed during the fiscal year. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes.\nTotal average outstanding debt increased from $249.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $273.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. For the year ended February 29, 2020, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 4.71% compared to the 4.62% for the year ended February 28, 2019. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by an increase of $34.5 million in the average outstanding borrowings from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, which carry a fixed rate 6.25% interest rate. The average outstanding borrowings of the 2023 Notes decreased $11.3 million from $74.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $63.2 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. As noted above, the 2023 Notes were redeemed during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. At February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the SBA debentures represented 71.4% and 52.7% of overall debt, respectively.\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in total outstanding debt. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in average outstanding debt from $212.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2018 to $249.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019. For the year ended February 28, 2019, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 4.62% compared to the 4.50% for the year ended February 28, 2018. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by the issuance of the 2025 Notes which carry a fixed rate of 6.25%, versus the SBA debentures that carry a lower interest rate. At February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the SBA debentures represented 52.7% and 64.9% of overall debt, respectively.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, base management fees increased $1.2 million, or 17.7% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The increase in base management fees results from the 17.7% increase in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents, from $393.1 million as of February 28, 2019 to $462.8 million as of February 29, 2020.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, base management fees increased $1.0 million, or 17.7% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. The increase in base management fees results from the 17.7% increase in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents, from $334.1 million as of February 28, 2018 to $393.1 million as of February 28, 2019.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, incentive management fees increased $9.3 million, or 189.6% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The first part of the incentive management fees increased this year from $4.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $5.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020, as higher average total assets of 17.7% has led to increased net investment income above the hurdle rate pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement. The incentive management fees related to capital gains increased from $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, reflecting the net realized and unrealized gain on investments this year, primarily related to our Censis Technologies, Inc. and Easy Ice, LLC investments and also including the impact of the deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, incentive management fees increased $0.6 million, or 12.9% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. The first part of the incentive management fees increased this year from $3.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2018 to $4.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2019, as higher average total assets of 17.7% has led to increased net investment income above the hurdle rate pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement. The incentive management fees related to capital gains decreased from $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 to $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, reflecting the net realized and unrealized gain on investments this year, including the impact of the deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, professional fees decreased $0.2 million, or 8.9% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. This decrease primarily relates to decreased legal and accounting fees this year, as the shelf registration statement last year led to higher fees.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, professional fees increased $0.3 million, or 16.3% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. This increase primarily relates to increased legal, valuation and accounting fees, including additional cost related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act implementation.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, administrator expenses increased $0.2 million, or 12.4% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, which reflects an increase to the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from $2.0 million to $2.225 million, effective August 1, 2019.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, administrator expenses increased $0.3 million, or 15.2% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, which reflects an increase to the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from $1.75 million to $2.0 million, effective August 1, 2018.\nAs discussed above, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt as compared to the prior years.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility was approximately $0.6 million, $3.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowing under the Credit Facility was 6.66%, 7.10% and 6.02%, respectively.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the average borrowings outstanding of SBA debentures was $150.0 million, $146.0 million and $130.1 million, respectively.

Based on 9,319,192 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 29, 2020, our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $5.98 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This compares to a per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $2.63 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 (based on 7,046,686 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 28, 2019), and a per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $2.93 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 (based on 6,024,040 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 28, 2018).\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned from our investments in debt in middle market companies, interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, future borrowings and future offerings of securities.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings, including our dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d), and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital will be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has historically traded at a price below our current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.\nIn addition, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income in order to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to RICs under the Code. In satisfying this distribution requirement, in accordance with certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. We may rely on the revenue procedure in future periods to satisfy our RIC distribution requirement.\nAlso, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 200.0%, reduced to 150.0% effective April 16, 2019 following the approval received from the non-interested board of directors on April 16, 2018. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. Our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 607.1% as of February 29, 2020 and 234.5% as of February 28, 2019. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nConsequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. Also, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nMadison revolving credit facility\nBelow is a summary of the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility we entered into with Madison Capital Funding LLC (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) on June 30, 2010, which was most recently amended on April 24, 2020.\nAvailability. The Company can draw up to the lesser of (i) $40.0 million (the \u201cFacility Amount\u201d) and (ii) the product of the applicable advance rate (which varies from 50.0% to 75.0% depending on the type of loan asset) and the value, determined in accordance with the Credit Facility (the \u201cAdjusted Borrowing Value\u201d), of certain \u201celigible\u201d loan assets pledged as security for the loan (the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d), in each case less (a) the amount of any undrawn funding commitments the Company has under any loan asset and which are not covered by amounts in the Unfunded Exposure Account referred to below (the \u201cUnfunded Exposure Amount\u201d) and outstanding borrowings. Each loan asset held by the Company as of the date on which the Credit Facility was closed was valued as of that date and each loan asset that the Company acquires after such date will be valued at the lowest of its fair value, its face value (excluding accrued interest) and the purchase price paid for such loan asset. Adjustments to the value of a loan asset will be made to reflect, among other things, changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan asset, insolvency of the obligor, acceleration of the loan asset, and certain modifications to the terms of the loan asset.\nThe Credit Facility contains limitations on the type of loan assets that are \u201celigible\u201d to be included in the Borrowing Base and as to the concentration level of certain categories of loan assets in the Borrowing Base such as restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, asset size and quality, payment frequency, status and terms, average life, and collateral interests. In addition, if an asset is to remain an \u201celigible\u201d loan asset, the Company may not make changes to the payment, amortization, collateral and certain other terms of the loan assets without the consent of the administrative agent that will either result in subordination of the loan asset or be materially adverse to the lenders.\nCollateral. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (other than assets held by our SBIC subsidiaries) and includes the subordinated notes (\u201cCLO Notes\u201d) issued by Saratoga CLO and the Company's rights under the CLO Management Agreement (as defined below).\nInterest Rate and Fees. Under the Credit Facility, funds are borrowed from or through certain lenders at the greater of the prevailing LIBOR rate and 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of 4.75%. At the Company's option, funds may be borrowed based on an alternative base rate, which in no event will be less than 2.00%, and the applicable margin over such alternative base rate is 3.75%. In addition, the Company pays the lenders a commitment fee of 0.75% per year on the unused amount of the Credit Facility for the duration of the Revolving Period (defined below). Accrued interest and commitment fees are payable monthly. The Company was also obligated to pay certain other fees to the lenders in connection with the closing of the Credit Facility.\nRevolving Period and Maturity Date. The Company may make and repay borrowings under the Credit Facility for a period of three years following the closing of the Credit Facility (the \u201cRevolving Period\u201d). The Revolving Period may be terminated at an earlier time by the Company or, upon the occurrence of an event of default, by action of the lenders or automatically. All borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Facility are due and payable in full five years after the end of the Revolving Period.\nCollateral Tests. It is a condition precedent to any borrowing under the Credit Facility that the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, after giving effect to the proposed borrowings, not exceed the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the Facility Amount (the \u201cBorrowing Base Test\u201d). In addition to satisfying the Borrowing Base Test, the following tests must also be satisfied (together with Borrowing Base Test, the \u201cCollateral Tests\u201d):\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Interest Coverage Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of interest collections with respect to pledged loan assets, less certain fees and expenses relating to the Credit Facility, to accrued interest and commitment fees and any breakage costs payable to the lenders under the Credit Facility for the last 6 payment periods must equal at least 175.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Overcollateralization Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets plus the fair value of certain ineligible pledged loan assets and the CLO Notes (in each case, subject to certain adjustments) to outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility plus the Unfunded Exposure Amount must equal at least 200.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted Average FMV Test. The aggregate adjusted or weighted value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets as a percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets must be equal to or greater than 72.0% and 80.0% during the one-year periods prior to the first and second anniversary of the closing date, respectively, and 85.0% at all times thereafter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Credit Facility also requires payment of outstanding borrowings or replacement of pledged loan assets upon the Company's breach of its representation and warranty that pledged loan assets included in the Borrowing Base are \u201celigible\u201d loan assets. Such payments or replacements must equal the lower of the amount by which the Borrowing Base is overstated as a result of such breach or any deficiency under the Collateral Tests at the time of repayment or replacement. Compliance with the Collateral Tests is also a condition to the discretionary sale of pledged loan assets by the Company.\nPriority of Payments. During the Revolving Period, the priority of payments provisions of the Credit Facility require, after payment of specified fees and expenses and any necessary funding of the Unfunded Exposure Account, that collections of principal from the loan assets and, to the extent that these are insufficient, collections of interest from the loan assets, be applied on each payment date to payment of outstanding borrowings if the Borrowing Base Test, the Overcollateralization Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio would not otherwise be met. Similarly, following termination of the Revolving Period, collections of interest are required to be applied, after payment of certain fees and expenses, to cure any deficiencies in the Borrowing Base Test, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the Overcollateralization Ratio as of the relevant payment date.\nReserve Account. The Credit Facility requires the Company to set aside an amount equal to the sum of accrued interest, commitment fees and administrative agent fees due and payable on the next succeeding three payment dates (or corresponding to three payment periods). If for any monthly period during which fees and other payments accrue, the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets which do not pay cash interest at least quarterly exceeds 15.0% of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets, the Company is required to set aside such interest and fees due and payable on the next succeeding six payment dates. Amounts in the reserve account can be applied solely to the payment of administrative agent fees, commitment fees, accrued and unpaid interest and any breakage costs payable to the lenders.\nUnfunded Exposure Account. With respect to revolver or delayed draw loan assets, the Company is required to set aside in a designated account (the \u201cUnfunded Exposure Account\u201d) 100.0% of its outstanding and undrawn funding commitments with respect to such loan assets. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded at the time the Company acquires a revolver or delayed draw loan asset and requests a related borrowing under the Credit Facility. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded through a combination of proceeds of the requested borrowing and other Company funds, and if for any reason such amounts are insufficient, through application of the priority of payment provisions described above.\nOperating Expenses. The priority of payments provision of the Credit Facility provides for the payment of certain operating expenses of the Company out of collections on principal and interest during the Revolving Period and out of collections on interest following the termination of the Revolving Period in accordance with the priority established in such provision. The operating expenses payable pursuant to the priority of payment provisions is limited to $350,000 for each monthly payment date or $2.5 million for the immediately preceding period of twelve consecutive monthly payment dates. This ceiling can be increased by the lesser of 5.0% or the percentage increase in the fair market value of all the Company's assets only on the first monthly payment date to occur after each one-year anniversary following the closing of the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of a Manager Event (described below), the consent of the administrative agent is required in order to pay operating expenses through the priority of payments provision.\nEvents of Default.

The Company paid certain fees and reimbursed Madison Capital Funding LLC for the aggregate amount of all documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, incurred by Madison Capital Funding LLC in connection with the Credit Facility and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated thereunder up to and as of the date of closing of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates.

As of February 28, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. Our borrowing base under the Credit Facility at February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 was $35.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively.\nOur asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 607.1% as of February 29, 2020 and 234.5% as of February 28, 2019.\nSBA-guaranteed debentures\nIn addition, we, through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, sought and obtained licenses from the SBA to operate an SBIC. In this regard, on March 28, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC LP, received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 and on August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP, also received a license. SBICs are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.\nThe SBIC license allows our SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.\nSBA regulations previously limited the amount that our SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. This maximum has been increased by SBA regulators for new licenses to $175.0 million of SBA debentures when it has at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital. The new license will provide up to $175.0 million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA-guaranteed debentures. The SBIC LP and SBIC II LP are regulated by the SBA. As a result of the 2016 omnibus spending bill signed into law in December 2015, the maximum amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that affiliated SBIC funds can have outstanding was increased from $225.0 million to $350.0 million. Our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries are able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including but not limited to an examination by the SBA. With this license approval, Saratoga will grow its SBA relationship from $150.0 million to $325.0 million of committed capital.\nWe received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. On April 16, 2018, as permitted by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, our non-interested board of directors approved of our becoming subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150.0% from 200% under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, as amended. The 150.0% asset coverage ratio became effective on April 16, 2019.\nAs of February 29, 2020, our SBIC LP subsidiary had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding and our SBIC II LP subsidiary had $50.0 million in regulatory capital and did not have any SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.\nUnsecured notes\nIn May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes for net proceeds of $46.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters' full exercise of their overallotment option. Interest on these 2020 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, at a rate of 7.50% per year, beginning August 15, 2013. The 2020 Notes mature on May 31, 2020 and since May 31, 2016, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we agreed to the following covenants for the period of time during which the 2020 Notes are outstanding:\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> we will not violate (whether or not we are subject to) Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC.

Currently these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 200.0% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017 and are no longer listed on the NYSE.\nOn May 29, 2015, we entered into a Debt Distribution Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes through an ATM offering.

The issuance included the exercise of substantially all of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $9.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes within 30 days.

The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2020 Notes on January 13, 2017, which amounted to $61.8 million, and for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes and are no longer listed on the NYSE.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% fixed-rate notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $38.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.3 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.3 million.

The 2025 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAF\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company completed a re-opening and up-sizing of its existing 2025 Notes by issuing an additional $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of $19.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.6 million and discount of $0.2 million.

The number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion was calculated based on a price of $1.5099 per share, which equaled the volume weighted average trading price per share of the common stock on December 24 and 28, 2009.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that these measures will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to support our operations and growth.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table shows our payment obligations for repayment of debt and other contractual obligations at February 29, 2020:\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SBA debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2025 Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAt February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $64.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments outstanding to provide debt financing to its portfolio companies or to fund limited partnership interests.

Our investment objective is to create attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income and long-term capital appreciation from our investments. We invest primarily in senior and unitranche leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies having earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) of between $2 million and $50 million, both through direct lending and through participation in loan syndicates. We may also invest up to 30.0% of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in distressed debt, which may include securities of companies in bankruptcy, foreign debt, private equity, securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation funds. Although we have no current intention to do so, to the extent we invest in private equity funds, we will limit our investments in entities that are excluded from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which includes private equity funds, to no more than 15.0% of its net assets. We have elected and qualified to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nCorporate History\nWe commenced operations, at the time known as GSC Investment Corp., on March 23, 2007 and completed an initial public offering of shares of common stock on March 28, 2007. Prior to July 30, 2010, we were externally managed and advised by GSCP (NJ), L.P., an entity affiliated with GSC Group, Inc. In connection with the consummation of a recapitalization transaction on July 30, 2010, as described below we engaged Saratoga Investment Advisors (\u201cSIA\u201d) to replace GSCP (NJ), L.P. as our investment adviser and changed our name to Saratoga Investment Corp.\nAs a result of the event of default under a revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank we previously had in place, in December 2008 we engaged the investment banking firm of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company to evaluate strategic transaction opportunities and consider alternatives for us. On April 14, 2010, GSC Investment Corp. entered into a stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates and an assignment, assumption and novation agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, pursuant to which GSC Investment Corp. assumed certain rights and obligations of Saratoga Investment Advisors under a debt commitment letter Saratoga Investment Advisors received from Madison Capital Funding LLC, which indicated Madison Capital Funding's willingness to provide GSC Investment Corp. with a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In addition, GSC Investment Corp. and GSCP (NJ), L.P. entered into a termination and release agreement, to be effective as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which GSCP (NJ), L.P., among other things, agreed to waive any and all accrued and unpaid deferred incentive management fees up to and as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement but continued to be entitled to receive the base management fees earned through the date of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement.\nOn July 30, 2010, the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates were completed, the private sale of 986,842 shares of our common stock for $15.0 million in aggregate purchase price to Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates closed, the Company entered into the Credit Facility, and the Company began doing business as Saratoga Investment Corp.\nWe used the net proceeds from the private sale transaction and a portion of the funds available to us under the Credit Facility to pay the full amount of principal and accrued interest, including default interest, outstanding under our revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank. The revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank was terminated in connection with our payment of all amounts outstanding thereunder on July 30, 2010.\nOn August 12, 2010, we effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse\nstock split, every ten shares of our common stock were converted into one share of our common stock. Any fractional shares received as a result of the reverse stock split were redeemed for cash. The total cash payment in lieu of shares was $230. Immediately after the reverse stock split, we had 2,680,842 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nIn January 2011, we registered for public resale of the 986,842 shares of our common stock issued to Saratoga Investment\nAdvisors and certain of its affiliates.\nOn March 28, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC, LP (\u201cSBIC LP\u201d), received an SBIC license from the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). On August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP (\u201cSBIC II LP\u201d), also received an SBIC license from the SBA.\nIn May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $46.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters' full exercise of their overallotment option. The 2020 Notes were listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAQ\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share. The 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017.\nOn May 29, 2015, we entered into a Debt Distribution Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes through an At-the-Market (\u201cATM\u201d) offering. Prior to the 2020 Notes being redeemed in full, the Company sold 539,725 bonds with a principal of $13.5 million at an average price of $25.31 for aggregate net proceeds of $13.4 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn December 21, 2016, we issued $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $71.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $2.3 million and offering costs of approximately $0.5 million. The issuance included the exercise of substantially all of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $9.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes within 30 days. The 2023 Notes were listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAB\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes.\nOn March 16, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $30.0 million of our common stock through an ATM offering. Subsequent to this, BB&T Capital Markets and B. Riley FBR, Inc. were also added to the agreement. On July 9, 2019, the amount of the common stock to be offered through this offering was increased to $70.0 million, and on October 8, 2019, the amount of the common stock to be offered was increased to $130.0 million. As of February 29, 2020, the Company sold 3,922,018 shares for gross proceeds of $97.1 million at an average price of $24.77 for aggregate net proceeds of $95.9 million (net of transaction costs). For the year ended February 29, 2020, the Company sold 3,427,346 shares for gross proceeds of $85.9 million at an average price of $25.06 for aggregate net proceeds of $84.7 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn July 13, 2018, the Company issued 1,150,000 shares of its common stock priced at $25.00 per share (par value $0.001 per share) at an aggregate total of $28.75 million. The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.15 million and offering costs of approximately $0.2 million, amounted to approximately $27.4 million. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 172,500 shares of its common stock, which was not exercised.\nOn August 7, 2018, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1, Ltd. (\u201cSaratoga CLO\u201d), pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse may borrow from time to time up to $20 million from us in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, which expired on February 7, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 28, 2019, the maximum amount invested by us in the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan amounted to $20.0 million.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% fixed-rate notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $38.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.3 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.3 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest on the 2025 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, at a rate of 6.25% per year, beginning November 30, 2018. The 2025 Notes mature on August 31, 2025 and commencing August 31, 2021, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. Financing costs of $1.6 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes.\nOn December 14, 2018, the Company completed the third refinancing of the Saratoga CLO (the \u201c2013-1 Reset CLO Notes\u201d). This refinancing, among other things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. In addition to and as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO has also been upsized from $300 million in assets to approximately $500 million. As part of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 Notes tranche and $7.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing $4.5 million of Class F notes and $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan were repaid.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company completed a re-opening and up-sizing of its existing 2025 Notes by issuing an additional $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of $19.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.6 million and discount of $0.2 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.2 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest rate, interest payment dates and maturity remain unchanged from the existing 2025 Notes issued in August 2018. The net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. The financing costs and discount of $1.0 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes. At February 29, 2020, the total 2025 Notes outstanding was $60.0 million. The 2025 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAF\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share.\nOn August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP (\u201cSBIC II LP\u201d), also received an SBIC license from the SBA. The new license will provide up to $175.0 million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA debentures.\nOn February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time to time up to $20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan, which expires on August 20, 2021, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%.\nCOVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains and adversely impacting a number of industries. The outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risks with respect to the underlying value of the Company's portfolio companies, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, such as the potential negative impact to financing arrangements, company decisions to delay, defer and/or modify the character of dividends in order to preserve liquidity, increased costs of operations, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy.\nWe have evaluated subsequent events from February 29, 2020 through May 6, 2020. However, as the discussion in this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year end February 29, 2020, the analysis contained herein may not fully account for impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, for example, as of February 29, 2020, the Company valued its portfolio investments in conformity with U.S. GAAP based on the facts and circumstances known by the Company at that time, or reasonably expected to be known at that time. Due to the overall volatility that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused during the months that followed our February 29, 2020 valuation, any valuations conducted now or in the future in conformity with U.S. GAAP could result in a lower fair value of our portfolio. The potential impact to our results going forward will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its financial condition and results of operations will be affected at this time.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition and the recognition of capital gains incentive fee expense as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.\nInvestment Valuation\nThe Company accounts for its investments at fair value in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the Company to assume that its investments are to be sold or its liabilities are to be transferred at the balance sheet date in the principal market to independent market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third-party pricing services and market makers subject to any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant events affecting the value of these investments. We value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value as approved, in good faith, by our board of directors based on input from Saratoga Investment Advisors, the audit committee of our board of directors and a third party independent valuation firm. Determinations of fair value may involve subjective judgments and estimates. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors.\nWe undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available, as described below:\n \u2022 Each investment is initially valued by the responsible investment professionals of Saratoga Investment Advisors and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; and \n \u2022 An independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors independently reviews a selection of these preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment for which market quotes are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least once each fiscal year. We use a third-party independent valuation firm to value our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and the Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of the Saratoga CLOs every quarter. \nIn addition, all our investments are subject to the following valuation process:\n \u2022 The audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves each preliminary valuation and Saratoga Investment Advisors and an independent valuation firm (if applicable) will supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and \n \u2022 Our board of directors discusses the valuations and approves the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of Saratoga Investment Advisors, independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors. \nOur investment in Saratoga CLO is carried at fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and comparable yields for equity interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO, when available, as determined by SIA and recommended to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flow models, or an appropriate substitute, to form the basis for the valuation of our investment in Saratoga CLO. The models use a set of assumptions including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rate and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The assumptions are based on available market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates. We use the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows) to perform a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash flows to determine a valuation for our investment in Saratoga CLO.\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Discounts and premiums on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the life of the respective investment using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as a reduction in principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nPayment-in-Kind Interest\nThe Company holds debt and preferred equity investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest provision. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing PIK interest if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains, if any, on equity interests that we may acquire. We expect our debt investments, whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt, to have terms of up to ten years, and to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our debt or preferred equity investments may provide for a portion or all of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned. We may also invest in preferred equity or common equity securities that pay dividends on a current basis.\nOn January 22, 2008, we entered into a collateral management agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced in October 2013 with its reinvestment period extended to October 2016. On November 15, 2016, we completed a second refinancing of the Saratoga CLO with its reinvestment period extended to October 2018.\nOn August 7, 2018, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement, CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse, Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse may borrow from time to time up to $20 million from us in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, which expires on February 7, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 28, 2019, the maximum amount invested by us in the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan amounted to $20.0 million.\nOn December 14, 2018, we completed a third refinancing and upsize of the Saratoga CLO. The third Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity date to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. Following this refinancing, the Saratoga CLO portfolio increased from approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount to approximately $500.0 million of predominantly senior secured first lien term loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, we invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO and also purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 and $7.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 notes tranches at par, with a coupon of LIBOR plus 8.75% and LIBOR plus 10.00%, respectively. As part of this refinancing, we also redeemed our existing $4.5 million aggregate amount of the Class F notes tranche at par and the $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan was repaid.\nOn February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time to time up to $20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan, which expires on August 20, 2021, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 29, 2020, the maximum amount invested by us in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 amounted to $2.5 million. As of February 29, 2020, the fair value of our investment in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 was $2.2 million.\nThe Saratoga CLO remains effectively 100% owned and managed by Saratoga Investment Corp. We receive a base management fee of 0.10% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.40% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO's assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds. Prior to the second refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Amended CLO Notes, we received a base management fee of 0.25% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.25% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO's assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds.\nFollowing the third refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, we are no longer entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 20.0% of excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater than 12.0%.\nInterest income on our investment in Saratoga CLO is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (\u201cASC 325-40\u201d), based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed.\nASC 606\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In May 2016, ASU 2016-12 amended ASU 2014-09 and deferred the effective period for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management has concluded that the majority of its revenues associated with financial instruments are scoped out of ASC 606, and has concluded that the only significant impact relates to the timing of the recognition of the CLO incentive fee income. We adopted ASC 606 under the modified retrospective approach using the practical expedient provided for, therefore the presentation of prior periods has not been adjusted.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of investment advisory and management fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance, fees paid to independent directors and administrator expenses, including our allocable portion of our administrator's overhead. Our investment advisory and management fees compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:\n \u2022 organization; \n \u2022 calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); \n \u2022 expenses incurred by our Investment Adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; \n \u2022 expenses incurred by our Investment Adviser payable for travel and due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; \n \u2022 interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; \n \u2022 offerings of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 investment advisory and management fees; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \n \u2022 all costs of registration and listing our common stock on any securities exchange; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the SBA); \n \u2022 costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to common stockholders including printing costs; \n \u2022 our fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; and \n \u2022 administration fees and all other expenses incurred by us or, if applicable, the administrator in connection with administering our business (including payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under an Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their respective staffs (including travel expenses)).  Pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement that we had with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser and administrator, we had agreed to pay GSCP (NJ), L.P. as investment adviser a quarterly base management fee of 1.75% of the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters and an incentive fee.\nThe incentive fee had two parts:\n \u2022 A fee, payable quarterly in arrears, equal to 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, that exceeded a 1.875% quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive fee. Since the hurdle rate was based on net assets, a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted in an incentive fee. \n \u2022 A fee, payable at the end of each fiscal year, equal to 20.0% of our net realized capital gains, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, in each case on a cumulative basis on each investment in the Company's portfolio, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid to the investment adviser through such date.  We deferred cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our former investment adviser if, during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) (before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period) was less than 7.5% of our net assets at the beginning of such period. These calculations were appropriately pro-rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period. Such incentive fee would become payable on the next date on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment advisory and management agreement. We commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended August 31, 2007 and continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended May 31, 2010. As of July 30, 2010, the date on which GSCP (NJ), L.P. ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator, we owed GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 million in fees for services previously provided to us; of which $0.3 million has been paid by us. GSCP (NJ), L.P. agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining $2.6 million in connection with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates described elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe terms of the investment advisory and management agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, our current investment adviser, are substantially similar to the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement we had entered into with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser, except for the following material distinctions in the fee terms:\n \u2022 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee was reset with respect to gains and losses from May 31, 2010, and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors and, as a result, Saratoga Investment Advisors will be entitled to 20.0% of net gains that arise after May 31, 2010. In addition, the cost basis for computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 equal the fair value of such investment as of such date. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P., the capital gains fee was calculated from March 21, 2007, and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses. \n \u2022 Under the \u201ccatch up\u201d provision, 100.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeds 1.875% but is less than or equal to 2.344% in any fiscal quarter is payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors. This will enable Saratoga Investment Advisors to receive 20.0% of all net investment income as such amount approaches 2.344% in any quarter, and Saratoga Investment Advisors will receive 20.0% of any additional net investment income. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P. only received 20.0% of the excess net investment income over 1.875%. \n \u2022 We will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than 7.5% for the preceding four fiscal quarters.  Capital Gains Incentive Fee\nThe Company records an expense accrual relating to the capital gains incentive fee payable by the Company to its Manager when the unrealized gains on its investments exceed all realized capital losses on its investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Manager if the Company were to liquidate its investment portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to the Company's Manager related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d). The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. Management has assessed these changes and does not believe they would have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\nSEC Disclosure Update and Simplification\nIn March 2019, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10618, Fast Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, amending certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements and to provide for a consistent set of rules to govern incorporating information by reference and hyperlinking, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. The Company has adopted the final rule, as applicable under SEC Release No. 33-10618 and determined the effect of the adoption of the simplification rules on financial statements will be limited to the modification and removal of certain disclosures.\nPortfolio and investment activity\nInvestment Portfolio Overview\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 29,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of investments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of portfolio companies(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment per portfolio company(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 11.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment size(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average maturity(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 yrs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6yrs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5yrs </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of industries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing or delinquent investments (fair value)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate debt (% of interest earning portfolio)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.7(6.8 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.7(16.3 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82.5(26.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate debt (weighted average current coupon)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate debt (% of interest earning portfolio)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404.4(93.2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>285.0(83.7 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229.3(73.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate debt (weighted average current spread over\nLIBOR)(3)(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO. \n (2) At February 29, 2020, excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of Saratoga CLO and loan to Saratoga Investment Corp.

On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes.\nTotal average outstanding debt increased from $249.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $273.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. For the year ended February 29, 2020, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 4.71% compared to the 4.62% for the year ended February 28, 2019. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by an increase of $34.5 million in the average outstanding borrowings from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, which carry a fixed rate 6.25% interest rate. The average outstanding borrowings of the 2023 Notes decreased $11.3 million from $74.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $63.2 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. As noted above, the 2023 Notes were redeemed during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. At February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the SBA debentures represented 71.4% and 52.7% of overall debt, respectively.\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in total outstanding debt. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in average outstanding debt from $212.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2018 to $249.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019. For the year ended February 28, 2019, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 4.62% compared to the 4.50% for the year ended February 28, 2018. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by the issuance of the 2025 Notes which carry a fixed rate of 6.25%, versus the SBA debentures that carry a lower interest rate. At February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the SBA debentures represented 52.7% and 64.9% of overall debt, respectively.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, base management fees increased $1.2 million, or 17.7% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.

The first part of the incentive management fees increased this year from $4.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $5.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020, as higher average total assets of 17.7% has led to increased net investment income above the hurdle rate pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement. The incentive management fees related to capital gains increased from $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, reflecting the net realized and unrealized gain on investments this year, primarily related to our Censis Technologies, Inc. and Easy Ice, LLC investments and also including the impact of the deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, incentive management fees increased $0.6 million, or 12.9% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. The first part of the incentive management fees increased this year from $3.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2018 to $4.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2019, as higher average total assets of 17.7% has led to increased net investment income above the hurdle rate pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement. The incentive management fees related to capital gains decreased from $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 to $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, reflecting the net realized and unrealized gain on investments this year, including the impact of the deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, professional fees decreased $0.2 million, or 8.9% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. This decrease primarily relates to decreased legal and accounting fees this year, as the shelf registration statement last year led to higher fees.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, professional fees increased $0.3 million, or 16.3% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. This increase primarily relates to increased legal, valuation and accounting fees, including additional cost related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act implementation.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, administrator expenses increased $0.2 million, or 12.4% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, which reflects an increase to the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from $2.0 million to $2.225 million, effective August 1, 2019.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, administrator expenses increased $0.3 million, or 15.2% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, which reflects an increase to the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from $1.75 million to $2.0 million, effective August 1, 2018.\nAs discussed above, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt as compared to the prior years.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility was approximately $0.6 million, $3.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowing under the Credit Facility was 6.66%, 7.10% and 6.02%, respectively.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the average borrowings outstanding of SBA debentures was $150.0 million, $146.0 million and $130.1 million, respectively. For the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings of the SBA debentures was 3.23%, 3.20% and 3.14%, respectively.\nDuring the year ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the average dollar amount of our 6.25% fixed-rate 2025 Notes outstanding was $60.0 million and $25.5 million, respectively.\nAs discussed above, during the fourth quarter of 2020 fiscal year, the Company redeemed $74.45 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes. During the years ended February 29, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the average dollar amount of our 6.75% fixed-rate 2023 Notes outstanding was $63.2 million, $74.5 million and $74.5 million, respectively.\nFor the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, we recognized income tax expense (benefit) of $1.0 million, $(1.0) million and $0.0 million, respectively. This relates to net deferred federal and state income tax expense (benefit) with respect to operating gains and losses and income derived from equity investments held in the taxable blockers.\nNet realized gains (losses) on sales of investments\nFor the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, the Company had $167.3 million of sales, repayments, exits or restructurings resulting in $42.9 million of net realized gains.

Based on 9,319,192 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 29, 2020, our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $5.98 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This compares to a per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $2.63 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 (based on 7,046,686 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 28, 2019), and a per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $2.93 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 (based on 6,024,040 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 28, 2018).\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned from our investments in debt in middle market companies, interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, future borrowings and future offerings of securities.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings, including our dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d), and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital will be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has historically traded at a price below our current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.\nIn addition, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income in order to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to RICs under the Code. In satisfying this distribution requirement, in accordance with certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. We may rely on the revenue procedure in future periods to satisfy our RIC distribution requirement.\nAlso, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 200.0%, reduced to 150.0% effective April 16, 2019 following the approval received from the non-interested board of directors on April 16, 2018. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. Our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 607.1% as of February 29, 2020 and 234.5% as of February 28, 2019. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nConsequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. Also, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nMadison revolving credit facility\nBelow is a summary of the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility we entered into with Madison Capital Funding LLC (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) on June 30, 2010, which was most recently amended on April 24, 2020.\nAvailability. The Company can draw up to the lesser of (i) $40.0 million (the \u201cFacility Amount\u201d) and (ii) the product of the applicable advance rate (which varies from 50.0% to 75.0% depending on the type of loan asset) and the value, determined in accordance with the Credit Facility (the \u201cAdjusted Borrowing Value\u201d), of certain \u201celigible\u201d loan assets pledged as security for the loan (the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d), in each case less (a) the amount of any undrawn funding commitments the Company has under any loan asset and which are not covered by amounts in the Unfunded Exposure Account referred to below (the \u201cUnfunded Exposure Amount\u201d) and outstanding borrowings. Each loan asset held by the Company as of the date on which the Credit Facility was closed was valued as of that date and each loan asset that the Company acquires after such date will be valued at the lowest of its fair value, its face value (excluding accrued interest) and the purchase price paid for such loan asset. Adjustments to the value of a loan asset will be made to reflect, among other things, changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan asset, insolvency of the obligor, acceleration of the loan asset, and certain modifications to the terms of the loan asset.\nThe Credit Facility contains limitations on the type of loan assets that are \u201celigible\u201d to be included in the Borrowing Base and as to the concentration level of certain categories of loan assets in the Borrowing Base such as restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, asset size and quality, payment frequency, status and terms, average life, and collateral interests. In addition, if an asset is to remain an \u201celigible\u201d loan asset, the Company may not make changes to the payment, amortization, collateral and certain other terms of the loan assets without the consent of the administrative agent that will either result in subordination of the loan asset or be materially adverse to the lenders.\nCollateral. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (other than assets held by our SBIC subsidiaries) and includes the subordinated notes (\u201cCLO Notes\u201d) issued by Saratoga CLO and the Company's rights under the CLO Management Agreement (as defined below).\nInterest Rate and Fees. Under the Credit Facility, funds are borrowed from or through certain lenders at the greater of the prevailing LIBOR rate and 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of 4.75%. At the Company's option, funds may be borrowed based on an alternative base rate, which in no event will be less than 2.00%, and the applicable margin over such alternative base rate is 3.75%. In addition, the Company pays the lenders a commitment fee of 0.75% per year on the unused amount of the Credit Facility for the duration of the Revolving Period (defined below). Accrued interest and commitment fees are payable monthly. The Company was also obligated to pay certain other fees to the lenders in connection with the closing of the Credit Facility.\nRevolving Period and Maturity Date. The Company may make and repay borrowings under the Credit Facility for a period of three years following the closing of the Credit Facility (the \u201cRevolving Period\u201d). The Revolving Period may be terminated at an earlier time by the Company or, upon the occurrence of an event of default, by action of the lenders or automatically. All borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Facility are due and payable in full five years after the end of the Revolving Period.\nCollateral Tests. It is a condition precedent to any borrowing under the Credit Facility that the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, after giving effect to the proposed borrowings, not exceed the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the Facility Amount (the \u201cBorrowing Base Test\u201d). In addition to satisfying the Borrowing Base Test, the following tests must also be satisfied (together with Borrowing Base Test, the \u201cCollateral Tests\u201d):\n \u2022 Interest Coverage Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of interest collections with respect to pledged loan assets, less certain fees and expenses relating to the Credit Facility, to accrued interest and commitment fees and any breakage costs payable to the lenders under the Credit Facility for the last 6 payment periods must equal at least 175.0%. \n \u2022 Overcollateralization Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets plus the fair value of certain ineligible pledged loan assets and the CLO Notes (in each case, subject to certain adjustments) to outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility plus the Unfunded Exposure Amount must equal at least 200.0%. \n \u2022 Weighted Average FMV Test. The aggregate adjusted or weighted value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets as a percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets must be equal to or greater than 72.0% and 80.0% during the one-year periods prior to the first and second anniversary of the closing date, respectively, and 85.0% at all times thereafter.  The Credit Facility also requires payment of outstanding borrowings or replacement of pledged loan assets upon the Company's breach of its representation and warranty that pledged loan assets included in the Borrowing Base are \u201celigible\u201d loan assets. Such payments or replacements must equal the lower of the amount by which the Borrowing Base is overstated as a result of such breach or any deficiency under the Collateral Tests at the time of repayment or replacement. Compliance with the Collateral Tests is also a condition to the discretionary sale of pledged loan assets by the Company.\nPriority of Payments. During the Revolving Period, the priority of payments provisions of the Credit Facility require, after payment of specified fees and expenses and any necessary funding of the Unfunded Exposure Account, that collections of principal from the loan assets and, to the extent that these are insufficient, collections of interest from the loan assets, be applied on each payment date to payment of outstanding borrowings if the Borrowing Base Test, the Overcollateralization Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio would not otherwise be met. Similarly, following termination of the Revolving Period, collections of interest are required to be applied, after payment of certain fees and expenses, to cure any deficiencies in the Borrowing Base Test, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the Overcollateralization Ratio as of the relevant payment date.\nReserve Account. The Credit Facility requires the Company to set aside an amount equal to the sum of accrued interest, commitment fees and administrative agent fees due and payable on the next succeeding three payment dates (or corresponding to three payment periods). If for any monthly period during which fees and other payments accrue, the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets which do not pay cash interest at least quarterly exceeds 15.0% of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets, the Company is required to set aside such interest and fees due and payable on the next succeeding six payment dates. Amounts in the reserve account can be applied solely to the payment of administrative agent fees, commitment fees, accrued and unpaid interest and any breakage costs payable to the lenders.\nUnfunded Exposure Account. With respect to revolver or delayed draw loan assets, the Company is required to set aside in a designated account (the \u201cUnfunded Exposure Account\u201d) 100.0% of its outstanding and undrawn funding commitments with respect to such loan assets. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded at the time the Company acquires a revolver or delayed draw loan asset and requests a related borrowing under the Credit Facility. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded through a combination of proceeds of the requested borrowing and other Company funds, and if for any reason such amounts are insufficient, through application of the priority of payment provisions described above.\nOperating Expenses. The priority of payments provision of the Credit Facility provides for the payment of certain operating expenses of the Company out of collections on principal and interest during the Revolving Period and out of collections on interest following the termination of the Revolving Period in accordance with the priority established in such provision. The operating expenses payable pursuant to the priority of payment provisions is limited to $350,000 for each monthly payment date or $2.5 million for the immediately preceding period of twelve consecutive monthly payment dates. This ceiling can be increased by the lesser of 5.0% or the percentage increase in the fair market value of all the Company's assets only on the first monthly payment date to occur after each one-year anniversary following the closing of the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of a Manager Event (described below), the consent of the administrative agent is required in order to pay operating expenses through the priority of payments provision.\nEvents of Default. The Credit Facility contains certain negative covenants, customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants and events of default. The Credit Facility does not contain grace periods for breach by the Company of certain covenants, including, without limitation, preservation of existence, negative pledge, change of name or jurisdiction and separate legal entity status of the Company covenants and certain other customary covenants. Other events of default under the Credit Facility include, among other things, the following:\n \u2022 an Interest Coverage Ratio of less than 150.0%; \n \u2022 an Overcollateralization Ratio of less than 175.0%; \n \u2022 the filing of certain ERISA or tax liens; \n \u2022 the occurrence of certain \u201cManager Events\u201d such as: \n \u2022 failure by Saratoga Investment Advisors and its affiliates to maintain collectively, directly or indirectly, a cash equity investment in the Company in an amount equal to at least $5.0 million at any time prior to the third anniversary of the closing date; \n \u2022 failure of the Management Agreement between Saratoga Investment Advisors and the Company to be in full force and effect; \n \u2022 indictment or conviction of Saratoga Investment Advisors or any \u201ckey person\u201d for a felony offense, or any fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by Saratoga Investment Advisors or any \u201ckey person\u201d and, in the case of \u201ckey persons,\u201d without a reputable, experienced individual reasonably satisfactory to Madison Capital Funding appointed to replace such key person within 30 days; \n \u2022 resignation, termination, disability or death of a \u201ckey person\u201d or failure of any \u201ckey person\u201d to provide active participation in Saratoga Investment Advisors' daily activities, all without a reputable, experienced individual reasonably satisfactory to Madison Capital Funding appointed within 30 days; or \n \u2022 occurrence of any event constituting \u201ccause\u201d under the Collateral Management Agreement between the Company and Saratoga CLO (the \u201cCLO Management Agreement\u201d), delivery of a notice under Section 12(c) of the CLO Management Agreement with respect to the removal of the Company as collateral manager or the Company ceases to act as collateral manager under the CLO Management Agreement.  Conditions to Acquisitions and Pledges of Loan Assets. The Credit Facility imposes certain additional conditions to the acquisition and pledge of additional loan assets. Among other things, the Company may not acquire additional loan assets without the prior written consent of the administrative agent until such time that the administrative agent indicates in writing its satisfaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors' policies, personnel and processes relating to the loan assets.\nFees and Expenses. The Company paid certain fees and reimbursed Madison Capital Funding LLC for the aggregate amount of all documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, incurred by Madison Capital Funding LLC in connection with the Credit Facility and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated thereunder up to and as of the date of closing of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates. These amounts totaled $2.0 million.\nOn February 24, 2012, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 expand the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $40.0 million to $45.0 million; \n \u2022 extend the period during which we may make and repay borrowings under the Credit Facility from July 30, 2013 to February 24, 2015 (the \u201cRevolving Period\u201d). The Revolving Period may, upon the occurrence of an event of default, by action of the lenders or automatically, be terminated. All borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Facility are due and payable five years after the end of the Revolving Period; and \n \u2022 remove the condition that we may not acquire additional loan assets without the prior written consent of the administrative agent.  On September 17, 2014, we entered into a second amendment to the Revolving Facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 extend the commitment termination date from February 24, 2015 to September 17, 2017; \n \u2022 extend the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from February 24, 2020 to September 17, 2022 (unless terminated sooner upon certain events); \n \u2022 reduce the applicable margin rate on base rate borrowings from 4.50% to 3.75%, and on LIBOR borrowings from 5.50% to 4.75%; and \n \u2022 reduce the floor on base rate borrowings from 3.00% to 2.25%; and on LIBOR borrowings from 2.00% to 1.25%.  On May 18, 2017, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 extend the commitment termination date from September 17, 2017 to September 17, 2020; \n \u2022 extend the final maturity date of the Credit Facility from September 17, 2022 to September 17, 2025; \n \u2022 reduce the floor on base rate borrowings from 2.25% to 2.00%; \n \u2022 reduce the floor on LIBOR borrowings from 1.25% to 1.00%; and \n \u2022 reduce the commitment fee rate from 0.75% to 0.50% for any period during which the ratio of advances outstanding to aggregate commitments, expressed as a percentage, is greater than or equal to 50%.  On April 24, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 permit certain amendments related to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPermitted PPP Amendment\u201d) to Loan Asset Documents; \n \u2022 exclude certain debt and interest amounts allowed by the Permitted PPP Amendments from certain calculations related to Net Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio and EBITDA; and \n \u2022 exclude such Permitted PPP Amendments from constituting a Material Modification. \nAs of February 29, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (which are discussed below). As of February 28, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. Our borrowing base under the Credit Facility at February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 was $35.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively.\nOur asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 607.1% as of February 29, 2020 and 234.5% as of February 28, 2019.\nSBA-guaranteed debentures\nIn addition, we, through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, sought and obtained licenses from the SBA to operate an SBIC. In this regard, on March 28, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC LP, received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 and on August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP, also received a license. SBICs are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.\nThe SBIC license allows our SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.\nSBA regulations previously limited the amount that our SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. This maximum has been increased by SBA regulators for new licenses to $175.0 million of SBA debentures when it has at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital. The new license will provide up to $175.0 million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA-guaranteed debentures. The SBIC LP and SBIC II LP are regulated by the SBA. As a result of the 2016 omnibus spending bill signed into law in December 2015, the maximum amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that affiliated SBIC funds can have outstanding was increased from $225.0 million to $350.0 million. Our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries are able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including but not limited to an examination by the SBA. With this license approval, Saratoga will grow its SBA relationship from $150.0 million to $325.0 million of committed capital.\nWe received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. On April 16, 2018, as permitted by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, our non-interested board of directors approved of our becoming subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150.0% from 200% under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, as amended. The 150.0% asset coverage ratio became effective on April 16, 2019.\nAs of February 29, 2020, our SBIC LP subsidiary had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding and our SBIC II LP subsidiary had $50.0 million in regulatory capital and did not have any SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.\nUnsecured notes\nIn May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes for net proceeds of $46.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters' full exercise of their overallotment option. Interest on these 2020 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, at a rate of 7.50% per year, beginning August 15, 2013. The 2020 Notes mature on May 31, 2020 and since May 31, 2016, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we agreed to the following covenants for the period of time during which the 2020 Notes are outstanding:\n \u2022 we will not violate (whether or not we are subject to) Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200.0% after such borrowings. \n \u2022 we will not violate (regardless of whether we are subject to) Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, but giving effect to (i) any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (ii) no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to the Company if it determines to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a) (1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain the BDC's status as a regulated investment company under the Code. Currently these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 200.0% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase. \nThe 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017 and are no longer listed on the NYSE.\nOn May 29, 2015, we entered into a Debt Distribution Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes through an ATM offering. Prior to the 2020 Notes being redeemed in full, the Company had sold 539,725 bonds with a principal of $13.5 million at an average price of $25.31 for aggregate net proceeds of $13.4 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn December 21, 2016, we issued $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 Notes for net proceeds of $71.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $2.3 million and offering costs of approximately $0.5 million. The issuance included the exercise of substantially all of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $9.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes within 30 days. Interest on the 2023 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, at a rate of 6.75% per year, beginning March 30, 2017. The 2023 Notes mature on December 30, 2023, and commencing December 21, 2019, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2020 Notes on January 13, 2017, which amounted to $61.8 million, and for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes and are no longer listed on the NYSE.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% fixed-rate notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $38.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.3 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.3 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest on the 2025 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, at a rate of 6.25% per year, beginning November 30, 2018. The 2025 Notes mature on August 31, 2025 and commencing August 31, 2021, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. Financing costs of $1.6 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAF\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company completed a re-opening and up-sizing of its existing 2025 Notes by issuing an additional $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of $19.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.6 million and discount of $0.2 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.2 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest rate, interest payment dates and maturity remain unchanged from the existing 2025 Notes issued in August 2018. The net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. The financing costs and discount of $1.0 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes.\nAt February 29, 2020, the total 2025 Notes outstanding was $60.0 million.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, we agreed to the following covenants for the period of time during which the notes are outstanding:\n \u2022 we will not violate (whether or not we are subject to) Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. These provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowings, or, if we obtain the required approvals from our independent directors and/or stockholders, 150% (after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be). \n \u2022 we will not declare any dividend (except a dividend payable in our stock), or declare any other distribution, upon a class of our capital stock, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, we have an asset coverage (as defined in the 1940 Act) of at least 150.0%, as such obligation may be amended or superseded, after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and in each case giving effect to (i) any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, and (ii) any SEC no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to us if we determine to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by such provisions of Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act as may be applicable to us from time to time, as such obligation may be amended or superseded, in order to maintain such BDC's status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code. \n \u2022 if, at any time, we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, to file any periodic reports with the SEC, we agree to furnish to holders of the 2025 Notes and the Trustee, for the period of time during which the 2025 Notes are outstanding, our audited annual consolidated financial statements, within 90 days of our fiscal year end, and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, within 45 days of our fiscal quarter end (other than our fourth fiscal quarter). All such financial statements will be prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with applicable United States generally accepted accounting principles. \nAt February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the fair value of total cash and cash equivalents, cash and cash equivalents in reserve accounts and total investments by major category are as follows:\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 29, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 24,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 30,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, reserve accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First lien term loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>346,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second lien term loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured term loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Structured finance securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>525,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>464,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> On July 13, 2018, the Company issued 1,150,000 shares of its common stock priced at $25.00 per share (par value $0.001 per share) at an aggregate total of $28.75 million.

Our investment objective is to create attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income and long-term capital appreciation from our investments. We invest primarily in senior and unitranche leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies having earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) of between $2 million and $50 million, both through direct lending and through participation in loan syndicates. We may also invest up to 30.0% of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in distressed debt, which may include securities of companies in bankruptcy, foreign debt, private equity, securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation funds. Although we have no current intention to do so, to the extent we invest in private equity funds, we will limit our investments in entities that are excluded from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which includes private equity funds, to no more than 15.0% of its net assets. We have elected and qualified to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nCorporate History\nWe commenced operations, at the time known as GSC Investment Corp., on March 23, 2007 and completed an initial public offering of shares of common stock on March 28, 2007. Prior to July 30, 2010, we were externally managed and advised by GSCP (NJ), L.P., an entity affiliated with GSC Group, Inc. In connection with the consummation of a recapitalization transaction on July 30, 2010, as described below we engaged Saratoga Investment Advisors (\u201cSIA\u201d) to replace GSCP (NJ), L.P. as our investment adviser and changed our name to Saratoga Investment Corp.\nAs a result of the event of default under a revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank we previously had in place, in December 2008 we engaged the investment banking firm of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company to evaluate strategic transaction opportunities and consider alternatives for us. On April 14, 2010, GSC Investment Corp. entered into a stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates and an assignment, assumption and novation agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, pursuant to which GSC Investment Corp. assumed certain rights and obligations of Saratoga Investment Advisors under a debt commitment letter Saratoga Investment Advisors received from Madison Capital Funding LLC, which indicated Madison Capital Funding's willingness to provide GSC Investment Corp. with a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In addition, GSC Investment Corp. and GSCP (NJ), L.P. entered into a termination and release agreement, to be effective as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which GSCP (NJ), L.P., among other things, agreed to waive any and all accrued and unpaid deferred incentive management fees up to and as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement but continued to be entitled to receive the base management fees earned through the date of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement.\nOn July 30, 2010, the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates were completed, the private sale of 986,842 shares of our common stock for $15.0 million in aggregate purchase price to Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates closed, the Company entered into the Credit Facility, and the Company began doing business as Saratoga Investment Corp.\nWe used the net proceeds from the private sale transaction and a portion of the funds available to us under the Credit Facility to pay the full amount of principal and accrued interest, including default interest, outstanding under our revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank. The revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank was terminated in connection with our payment of all amounts outstanding thereunder on July 30, 2010.\nOn August 12, 2010, we effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse\nstock split, every ten shares of our common stock were converted into one share of our common stock. Any fractional shares received as a result of the reverse stock split were redeemed for cash. The total cash payment in lieu of shares was $230. Immediately after the reverse stock split, we had 2,680,842 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nIn January 2011, we registered for public resale of the 986,842 shares of our common stock issued to Saratoga Investment\nAdvisors and certain of its affiliates.\nOn March 28, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC, LP (\u201cSBIC LP\u201d), received an SBIC license from the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). On August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP (\u201cSBIC II LP\u201d), also received an SBIC license from the SBA.\nIn May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $46.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters' full exercise of their overallotment option. The 2020 Notes were listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAQ\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share. The 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017.\nOn May 29, 2015, we entered into a Debt Distribution Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes through an At-the-Market (\u201cATM\u201d) offering. Prior to the 2020 Notes being redeemed in full, the Company sold 539,725 bonds with a principal of $13.5 million at an average price of $25.31 for aggregate net proceeds of $13.4 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn December 21, 2016, we issued $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $71.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $2.3 million and offering costs of approximately $0.5 million. The issuance included the exercise of substantially all of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $9.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes within 30 days. The 2023 Notes were listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAB\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes.\nOn March 16, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $30.0 million of our common stock through an ATM offering. Subsequent to this, BB&T Capital Markets and B. Riley FBR, Inc. were also added to the agreement. On July 9, 2019, the amount of the common stock to be offered through this offering was increased to $70.0 million, and on October 8, 2019, the amount of the common stock to be offered was increased to $130.0 million. As of February 29, 2020, the Company sold 3,922,018 shares for gross proceeds of $97.1 million at an average price of $24.77 for aggregate net proceeds of $95.9 million (net of transaction costs). For the year ended February 29, 2020, the Company sold 3,427,346 shares for gross proceeds of $85.9 million at an average price of $25.06 for aggregate net proceeds of $84.7 million (net of transaction costs).\nOn July 13, 2018, the Company issued 1,150,000 shares of its common stock priced at $25.00 per share (par value $0.001 per share) at an aggregate total of $28.75 million. The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.15 million and offering costs of approximately $0.2 million, amounted to approximately $27.4 million. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 172,500 shares of its common stock, which was not exercised.\nOn August 7, 2018, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1, Ltd. (\u201cSaratoga CLO\u201d), pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse may borrow from time to time up to $20 million from us in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, which expired on February 7, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 28, 2019, the maximum amount invested by us in the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan amounted to $20.0 million.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% fixed-rate notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) for net proceeds of $38.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.3 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.3 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest on the 2025 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, at a rate of 6.25% per year, beginning November 30, 2018. The 2025 Notes mature on August 31, 2025 and commencing August 31, 2021, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. Financing costs of $1.6 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes.\nOn December 14, 2018, the Company completed the third refinancing of the Saratoga CLO (the \u201c2013-1 Reset CLO Notes\u201d). This refinancing, among other things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. In addition to and as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO has also been upsized from $300 million in assets to approximately $500 million. As part of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 Notes tranche and $7.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing $4.5 million of Class F notes and $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan were repaid.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company completed a re-opening and up-sizing of its existing 2025 Notes by issuing an additional $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of $19.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.6 million and discount of $0.2 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.2 million. The issuance included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes within 30 days. Interest rate, interest payment dates and maturity remain unchanged from the existing 2025 Notes issued in August 2018. The net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. The financing costs and discount of $1.0 million related to the 2025 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes. At February 29, 2020, the total 2025 Notes outstanding was $60.0 million. The 2025 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAF\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share.\nOn August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP (\u201cSBIC II LP\u201d), also received an SBIC license from the SBA. The new license will provide up to $175.0 million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA debentures.\nOn February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time to time up to $20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan, which expires on August 20, 2021, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%.\nCOVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains and adversely impacting a number of industries. The outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risks with respect to the underlying value of the Company's portfolio companies, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, such as the potential negative impact to financing arrangements, company decisions to delay, defer and/or modify the character of dividends in order to preserve liquidity, increased costs of operations, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy.\nWe have evaluated subsequent events from February 29, 2020 through May 6, 2020. However, as the discussion in this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year end February 29, 2020, the analysis contained herein may not fully account for impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, for example, as of February 29, 2020, the Company valued its portfolio investments in conformity with U.S. GAAP based on the facts and circumstances known by the Company at that time, or reasonably expected to be known at that time. Due to the overall volatility that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused during the months that followed our February 29, 2020 valuation, any valuations conducted now or in the future in conformity with U.S. GAAP could result in a lower fair value of our portfolio. The potential impact to our results going forward will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its financial condition and results of operations will be affected at this time.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition and the recognition of capital gains incentive fee expense as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.\nInvestment Valuation\nThe Company accounts for its investments at fair value in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the Company to assume that its investments are to be sold or its liabilities are to be transferred at the balance sheet date in the principal market to independent market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third-party pricing services and market makers subject to any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant events affecting the value of these investments. We value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value as approved, in good faith, by our board of directors based on input from Saratoga Investment Advisors, the audit committee of our board of directors and a third party independent valuation firm. Determinations of fair value may involve subjective judgments and estimates. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors.\nWe undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available, as described below:\n \u2022 Each investment is initially valued by the responsible investment professionals of Saratoga Investment Advisors and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; and \n \u2022 An independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors independently reviews a selection of these preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment for which market quotes are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least once each fiscal year. We use a third-party independent valuation firm to value our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and the Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of the Saratoga CLOs every quarter. \nIn addition, all our investments are subject to the following valuation process:\n \u2022 The audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves each preliminary valuation and Saratoga Investment Advisors and an independent valuation firm (if applicable) will supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and \n \u2022 Our board of directors discusses the valuations and approves the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of Saratoga Investment Advisors, independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors. \nOur investment in Saratoga CLO is carried at fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and comparable yields for equity interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO, when available, as determined by SIA and recommended to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flow models, or an appropriate substitute, to form the basis for the valuation of our investment in Saratoga CLO. The models use a set of assumptions including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rate and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The assumptions are based on available market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates. We use the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows) to perform a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash flows to determine a valuation for our investment in Saratoga CLO.\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Discounts and premiums on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the life of the respective investment using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as a reduction in principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nPayment-in-Kind Interest\nThe Company holds debt and preferred equity investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest provision. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing PIK interest if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains, if any, on equity interests that we may acquire. We expect our debt investments, whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt, to have terms of up to ten years, and to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our debt or preferred equity investments may provide for a portion or all of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned. We may also invest in preferred equity or common equity securities that pay dividends on a current basis.\nOn January 22, 2008, we entered into a collateral management agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced in October 2013 with its reinvestment period extended to October 2016. On November 15, 2016, we completed a second refinancing of the Saratoga CLO with its reinvestment period extended to October 2018.\nOn August 7, 2018, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement, CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse, Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse may borrow from time to time up to $20 million from us in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan, which expires on February 7, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 28, 2019, the maximum amount invested by us in the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan amounted to $20.0 million.\nOn December 14, 2018, we completed a third refinancing and upsize of the Saratoga CLO. The third Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity date to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. Following this refinancing, the Saratoga CLO portfolio increased from approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount to approximately $500.0 million of predominantly senior secured first lien term loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, we invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO and also purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 and $7.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 notes tranches at par, with a coupon of LIBOR plus 8.75% and LIBOR plus 10.00%, respectively. As part of this refinancing, we also redeemed our existing $4.5 million aggregate amount of the Class F notes tranche at par and the $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan was repaid.\nOn February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan\u201d) with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd (\u201cCLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time to time up to $20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. The CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan, which expires on August 20, 2021, bears interest at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR + 7.5%. During the year ended February 29, 2020, the maximum amount invested by us in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 amounted to $2.5 million. As of February 29, 2020, the fair value of our investment in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 was $2.2 million.\nThe Saratoga CLO remains effectively 100% owned and managed by Saratoga Investment Corp. We receive a base management fee of 0.10% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.40% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO's assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds. Prior to the second refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Amended CLO Notes, we received a base management fee of 0.25% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.25% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO's assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds.\nFollowing the third refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, we are no longer entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 20.0% of excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater than 12.0%.\nInterest income on our investment in Saratoga CLO is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (\u201cASC 325-40\u201d), based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed.\nASC 606\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In May 2016, ASU 2016-12 amended ASU 2014-09 and deferred the effective period for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management has concluded that the majority of its revenues associated with financial instruments are scoped out of ASC 606, and has concluded that the only significant impact relates to the timing of the recognition of the CLO incentive fee income. We adopted ASC 606 under the modified retrospective approach using the practical expedient provided for, therefore the presentation of prior periods has not been adjusted.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of investment advisory and management fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance, fees paid to independent directors and administrator expenses, including our allocable portion of our administrator's overhead. Our investment advisory and management fees compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:\n \u2022 organization; \n \u2022 calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); \n \u2022 expenses incurred by our Investment Adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; \n \u2022 expenses incurred by our Investment Adviser payable for travel and due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; \n \u2022 interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; \n \u2022 offerings of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 investment advisory and management fees; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \n \u2022 all costs of registration and listing our common stock on any securities exchange; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the SBA); \n \u2022 costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to common stockholders including printing costs; \n \u2022 our fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; and \n \u2022 administration fees and all other expenses incurred by us or, if applicable, the administrator in connection with administering our business (including payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under an Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their respective staffs (including travel expenses)).  Pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement that we had with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser and administrator, we had agreed to pay GSCP (NJ), L.P. as investment adviser a quarterly base management fee of 1.75% of the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters and an incentive fee.\nThe incentive fee had two parts:\n \u2022 A fee, payable quarterly in arrears, equal to 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, that exceeded a 1.875% quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive fee. Since the hurdle rate was based on net assets, a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted in an incentive fee. \n \u2022 A fee, payable at the end of each fiscal year, equal to 20.0% of our net realized capital gains, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, in each case on a cumulative basis on each investment in the Company's portfolio, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid to the investment adviser through such date.  We deferred cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our former investment adviser if, during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) (before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period) was less than 7.5% of our net assets at the beginning of such period. These calculations were appropriately pro-rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period. Such incentive fee would become payable on the next date on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment advisory and management agreement. We commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended August 31, 2007 and continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended May 31, 2010. As of July 30, 2010, the date on which GSCP (NJ), L.P. ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator, we owed GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 million in fees for services previously provided to us; of which $0.3 million has been paid by us. GSCP (NJ), L.P. agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining $2.6 million in connection with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates described elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe terms of the investment advisory and management agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, our current investment adviser, are substantially similar to the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement we had entered into with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser, except for the following material distinctions in the fee terms:\n \u2022 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee was reset with respect to gains and losses from May 31, 2010, and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors and, as a result, Saratoga Investment Advisors will be entitled to 20.0% of net gains that arise after May 31, 2010. In addition, the cost basis for computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 equal the fair value of such investment as of such date. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P., the capital gains fee was calculated from March 21, 2007, and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses. \n \u2022 Under the \u201ccatch up\u201d provision, 100.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeds 1.875% but is less than or equal to 2.344% in any fiscal quarter is payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors. This will enable Saratoga Investment Advisors to receive 20.0% of all net investment income as such amount approaches 2.344% in any quarter, and Saratoga Investment Advisors will receive 20.0% of any additional net investment income. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P. only received 20.0% of the excess net investment income over 1.875%. \n \u2022 We will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than 7.5% for the preceding four fiscal quarters.  Capital Gains Incentive Fee\nThe Company records an expense accrual relating to the capital gains incentive fee payable by the Company to its Manager when the unrealized gains on its investments exceed all realized capital losses on its investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Manager if the Company were to liquidate its investment portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to the Company's Manager related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d). The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. Management has assessed these changes and does not believe they would have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\nSEC Disclosure Update and Simplification\nIn March 2019, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10618, Fast Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, amending certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements and to provide for a consistent set of rules to govern incorporating information by reference and hyperlinking, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. The Company has adopted the final rule, as applicable under SEC Release No. 33-10618 and determined the effect of the adoption of the simplification rules on financial statements will be limited to the modification and removal of certain disclosures.\nPortfolio and investment activity\nInvestment Portfolio Overview\n\n (1) Excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO. \n (2) At February 29, 2020, excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of Saratoga CLO and loan to Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd. At February 28, 2019, excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes tranches of Saratoga CLO. At February 28, 2018, excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and Class F Notes tranche of Saratoga CLO. \n (3) Excludes our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and equity interests. \n (4) Calculation uses either 1-month or 3-month LIBOR, depending on the contractual terms, and after factoring in any existing LIBOR floors. \nDuring the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, we invested $204.6 million in new or existing portfolio companies and had $167.3 million in aggregate amount of exits and repayments resulting in net investments of $37.3 million for the year.\nDuring the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, we invested $187.7 million in new or existing portfolio companies and had $135.7 million in aggregate amount of exits and repayments resulting in net investments of $52.0 million for the year.\nDuring the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, we invested $107.7 million in new or existing portfolio companies and had $66.3 million in aggregate amount of exits and repayments resulting in net investments of $41.4 million for the year.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur portfolio composition at February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 at fair value was as follows:\n\nAt February 29, 2020, our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO, a collateralized loan obligation fund, had a fair value of $22.6 million and constituted 4.6% of our portfolio. This investment constitutes a first loss position in a portfolio that, as of February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, was composed of $528.4 million and $510.3 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of primarily senior secured first lien term loans. In addition, as of February 29, 2020, we also own $2.5 million in aggregate principal of the F-R-2 Notes and $7.5 million in aggregate principal of the G-R-2 Notes in the Saratoga CLO, that only rank senior to the subordinated notes. At February 29, 2020, our investment in CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, had a fair value of $2.2 million and constituted 0.5% of our portfolio.\nThis investment is subject to unique risks. (See \u201cPart 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our investment in Saratoga CLO constitutes a leveraged investment in a portfolio of predominantly senior secured first lien term loans and is subject to additional risks and volatility\u201d). We do not consolidate the Saratoga CLO portfolio in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the metrics below do not include the underlying Saratoga CLO portfolio investments. However, at February 29, 2020, $494.2 million or 98.6% of the Saratoga CLO portfolio investments in terms of market value had a CMR (as defined below) color rating of green or yellow and two Saratoga CLO portfolio investments were in default with a fair value of $1.4 million. At February 28, 2019, $491.0 million or 98.5% of the Saratoga CLO portfolio investments in terms of market value had a CMR (as defined below) color rating of green or yellow and two Saratoga CLO portfolio investment were in default with a fair value of $0.01 million. For more information relating to Saratoga CLO, see the audited financial statements for Saratoga CLO included elsewhere herein.\nSaratoga Investment Advisors normally grades all of our investments using a credit and monitoring rating system (\u201cCMR\u201d). The CMR consists of a single component: a color rating. The color rating is based on several criteria, including financial and operating strength, probability of default, and restructuring risk. The color ratings are characterized as follows: (Green)-performing credit; (Yellow)-underperforming credit; (Red)-in principal payment default and/or expected loss of principal.\nPortfolio CMR distribution\nThe CMR distribution of our investments at February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 was as follows:\nSaratoga Investment Corp.\n\n (1) Comprised of our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and equity interests.  The change in reserve from $0.6 million as of February 28, 2019 to $1.2 million as of February 29, 2020 primarily related to the increase in reserve for the year for our investment in Roscoe Medical, Inc. and My Alarm Center, LLC, offset by the decrease in reserve for the year from the sale of M/C Acquisition, L.L.C.\nThe CMR distribution of Saratoga CLO investments at February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 was as follows:\nSaratoga CLO\n\n (1) Comprised of Saratoga CLO's equity interests. \nPortfolio composition by industry grouping at fair value\nThe following table shows our portfolio composition by industry grouping at fair value at February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019:\nSaratoga Investment Corp.\n\n (1) At February 29, 2020, comprised of our investment in the subordinated notes, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes of Saratoga CLO and Saratoga Investment Corp.

The geographic composition is determined by the location of the corporate headquarters of the portfolio company.\n\n (1) At February 29, 2020, comprised of our investment in the subordinated notes, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes of Saratoga CLO, Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd and foreign investments. At February 28, 2019, comprised of our investment in the subordinated notes, Class F-R-2 Notes and Class G-R-2 Notes of Saratoga CLO and foreign investments.  Results of operations\nOperating results for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 were as follows:\n\nInvestment income\nThe composition of our investment income for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 were as follows:\n For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, total investment income increased $10.7 million, or 22.5% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. Interest income from investments increased $4.7 million, or 11.0%, to $48.0 million for the year ended February 29, 2020 from $43.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. This reflects an increase of 20.8% in total investments to $485.6 million at February 29, 2020 from $402.0 million at February 28, 2019. At February 29, 2020, the weighted average current yield on investments was 9.3% compared to 10.7% at February 28, 2019, which offset some of the interest income increase.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, total investment income increased $9.1 million, or 23.5% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. Interest income from investments increased $8.2 million, or 23.3%, to $43.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 from $35.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. This reflects an increase of 17.3% in total investments to $402.0 million at February 28, 2019 from $342.7 million at February 28, 2018. At February 28, 2019, the weighted average current yield on investments was 10.7% compared to 11.1% at February 28, 2018, which offset some of the increase.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, total PIK income was $4.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the increase in investment in Easy Ice, LLC, which primarily generated PIK interest income. The Company sold its interest in Easy Ice, LLC during the year ended February 29, 2020.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, total PIK income was $4.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the increase in investment in Easy Ice, LLC, which primarily generates PIK interest income.\nFollowing the third refinancing of the CLO on December 14, 2018, the Company is no longer entitled to receive the incentive fee. For the years ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 incentive fee income of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, was recognized related to the Saratoga CLO, reflecting the 12.0% hurdle rate that has been achieved.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, total structuring and advisory fee income was $5.3 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

For the year ended February 28, 2019, total operating expenses increased $3.5 million, or 13.6% compared to the year ended February 28, 2018.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding borrowings of the 2025 Notes, partially offset by a decrease in the average outstanding borrowings of the 2023 Notes, which were redeemed during the fiscal year. On December 21, 2019 and February 7, 2020, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the $74.5 million in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes.\nTotal average outstanding debt increased from $249.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $273.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. For the year ended February 29, 2020, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 4.71% compared to the 4.62% for the year ended February 28, 2019. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by an increase of $34.5 million in the average outstanding borrowings from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, which carry a fixed rate 6.25% interest rate. The average outstanding borrowings of the 2023 Notes decreased $11.3 million from $74.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $63.2 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. As noted above, the 2023 Notes were redeemed during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. At February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the SBA debentures represented 71.4% and 52.7% of overall debt, respectively.\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in total outstanding debt. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in average outstanding debt from $212.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2018 to $249.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2019. For the year ended February 28, 2019, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 4.62% compared to the 4.50% for the year ended February 28, 2018. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by the issuance of the 2025 Notes which carry a fixed rate of 6.25%, versus the SBA debentures that carry a lower interest rate. At February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the SBA debentures represented 52.7% and 64.9% of overall debt, respectively.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, base management fees increased $1.2 million, or 17.7% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The increase in base management fees results from the 17.7% increase in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents, from $393.1 million as of February 28, 2019 to $462.8 million as of February 29, 2020.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, base management fees increased $1.0 million, or 17.7% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. The increase in base management fees results from the 17.7% increase in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents, from $334.1 million as of February 28, 2018 to $393.1 million as of February 28, 2019.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, incentive management fees increased $9.3 million, or 189.6% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The first part of the incentive management fees increased this year from $4.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2019 to $5.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020, as higher average total assets of 17.7% has led to increased net investment income above the hurdle rate pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement. The incentive management fees related to capital gains increased from $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, reflecting the net realized and unrealized gain on investments this year, primarily related to our Censis Technologies, Inc. and Easy Ice, LLC investments and also including the impact of the deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, incentive management fees increased $0.6 million, or 12.9% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. The first part of the incentive management fees increased this year from $3.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2018 to $4.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2019, as higher average total assets of 17.7% has led to increased net investment income above the hurdle rate pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement. The incentive management fees related to capital gains decreased from $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 to $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, reflecting the net realized and unrealized gain on investments this year, including the impact of the deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, professional fees decreased $0.2 million, or 8.9% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. This decrease primarily relates to decreased legal and accounting fees this year, as the shelf registration statement last year led to higher fees.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, professional fees increased $0.3 million, or 16.3% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. This increase primarily relates to increased legal, valuation and accounting fees, including additional cost related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act implementation.\nFor the year ended February 29, 2020, administrator expenses increased $0.2 million, or 12.4% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, which reflects an increase to the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from $2.0 million to $2.225 million, effective August 1, 2019.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2019, administrator expenses increased $0.3 million, or 15.2% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, which reflects an increase to the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from $1.75 million to $2.0 million, effective August 1, 2018.\nAs discussed above, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt as compared to the prior years.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility was approximately $0.6 million, $3.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowing under the Credit Facility was 6.66%, 7.10% and 6.02%, respectively.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, the average borrowings outstanding of SBA debentures was $150.0 million, $146.0 million and $130.1 million, respectively.

This relates to net deferred federal and state income tax expense (benefit) with respect to operating gains and losses and income derived from equity investments held in the taxable blockers.\nNet realized gains (losses) on sales of investments\nFor the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, the Company had $167.3 million of sales, repayments, exits or restructurings resulting in $42.9 million of net realized gains. The most significant realized gains and losses during the year ended February 29, 2020 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nFiscal year ended February 29, 2020\n The $31.2 million and $11.3 million of net realized gains was from the sales of the equity positions in Easy Ice, LLC and Censis Technologies, Inc., respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, the Company had $135.7 million of sales, repayments, exits or restructurings resulting in $4.9 million of net realized gains.

In recognizing this loss as a result of the sale, unrealized depreciation was adjusted to zero, which resulted in a $2.3 million change in unrealized appreciation for the year.\nThe $2.0 million of net change in unrealized appreciation in our investment in Easy Ice, LLC was driven by the completion of a strategic acquisition that increased the scale and earnings of the business.\nThe $1.9 million of net change in unrealized appreciation in our investment in Saratoga CLO was driven by continued improved performance of the Saratoga CLO.\nChanges in net assets resulting from operations\nFor the fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $55.7 million, $18.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively. Based on 9,319,192 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 29, 2020, our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $5.98 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This compares to a per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $2.63 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 (based on 7,046,686 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 28, 2019), and a per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $2.93 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 (based on 6,024,040 weighted average common shares outstanding as of February 28, 2018).\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned from our investments in debt in middle market companies, interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, future borrowings and future offerings of securities.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings, including our dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d), and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital will be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has historically traded at a price below our current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.\nIn addition, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income in order to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to RICs under the Code. In satisfying this distribution requirement, in accordance with certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. We may rely on the revenue procedure in future periods to satisfy our RIC distribution requirement.\nAlso, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 200.0%, reduced to 150.0% effective April 16, 2019 following the approval received from the non-interested board of directors on April 16, 2018. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. Our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 607.1% as of February 29, 2020 and 234.5% as of February 28, 2019. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nConsequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. Also, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nMadison revolving credit facility\nBelow is a summary of the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility we entered into with Madison Capital Funding LLC (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) on June 30, 2010, which was most recently amended on April 24, 2020.\nAvailability. The Company can draw up to the lesser of (i) $40.0 million (the \u201cFacility Amount\u201d) and (ii) the product of the applicable advance rate (which varies from 50.0% to 75.0% depending on the type of loan asset) and the value, determined in accordance with the Credit Facility (the \u201cAdjusted Borrowing Value\u201d), of certain \u201celigible\u201d loan assets pledged as security for the loan (the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d), in each case less (a) the amount of any undrawn funding commitments the Company has under any loan asset and which are not covered by amounts in the Unfunded Exposure Account referred to below (the \u201cUnfunded Exposure Amount\u201d) and outstanding borrowings. Each loan asset held by the Company as of the date on which the Credit Facility was closed was valued as of that date and each loan asset that the Company acquires after such date will be valued at the lowest of its fair value, its face value (excluding accrued interest) and the purchase price paid for such loan asset. Adjustments to the value of a loan asset will be made to reflect, among other things, changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan asset, insolvency of the obligor, acceleration of the loan asset, and certain modifications to the terms of the loan asset.\nThe Credit Facility contains limitations on the type of loan assets that are \u201celigible\u201d to be included in the Borrowing Base and as to the concentration level of certain categories of loan assets in the Borrowing Base such as restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, asset size and quality, payment frequency, status and terms, average life, and collateral interests. In addition, if an asset is to remain an \u201celigible\u201d loan asset, the Company may not make changes to the payment, amortization, collateral and certain other terms of the loan assets without the consent of the administrative agent that will either result in subordination of the loan asset or be materially adverse to the lenders.\nCollateral. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (other than assets held by our SBIC subsidiaries) and includes the subordinated notes (\u201cCLO Notes\u201d) issued by Saratoga CLO and the Company's rights under the CLO Management Agreement (as defined below).\nInterest Rate and Fees. Under the Credit Facility, funds are borrowed from or through certain lenders at the greater of the prevailing LIBOR rate and 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of 4.75%. At the Company's option, funds may be borrowed based on an alternative base rate, which in no event will be less than 2.00%, and the applicable margin over such alternative base rate is 3.75%. In addition, the Company pays the lenders a commitment fee of 0.75% per year on the unused amount of the Credit Facility for the duration of the Revolving Period (defined below). Accrued interest and commitment fees are payable monthly. The Company was also obligated to pay certain other fees to the lenders in connection with the closing of the Credit Facility.\nRevolving Period and Maturity Date. The Company may make and repay borrowings under the Credit Facility for a period of three years following the closing of the Credit Facility (the \u201cRevolving Period\u201d). The Revolving Period may be terminated at an earlier time by the Company or, upon the occurrence of an event of default, by action of the lenders or automatically. All borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Facility are due and payable in full five years after the end of the Revolving Period.\nCollateral Tests. It is a condition precedent to any borrowing under the Credit Facility that the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, after giving effect to the proposed borrowings, not exceed the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the Facility Amount (the \u201cBorrowing Base Test\u201d). In addition to satisfying the Borrowing Base Test, the following tests must also be satisfied (together with Borrowing Base Test, the \u201cCollateral Tests\u201d):\n \u2022 Interest Coverage Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of interest collections with respect to pledged loan assets, less certain fees and expenses relating to the Credit Facility, to accrued interest and commitment fees and any breakage costs payable to the lenders under the Credit Facility for the last 6 payment periods must equal at least 175.0%. \n \u2022 Overcollateralization Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets plus the fair value of certain ineligible pledged loan assets and the CLO Notes (in each case, subject to certain adjustments) to outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility plus the Unfunded Exposure Amount must equal at least 200.0%. \n \u2022 Weighted Average FMV Test. The aggregate adjusted or weighted value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets as a percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets must be equal to or greater than 72.0% and 80.0% during the one-year periods prior to the first and second anniversary of the closing date, respectively, and 85.0% at all times thereafter.  The Credit Facility also requires payment of outstanding borrowings or replacement of pledged loan assets upon the Company's breach of its representation and warranty that pledged loan assets included in the Borrowing Base are \u201celigible\u201d loan assets. Such payments or replacements must equal the lower of the amount by which the Borrowing Base is overstated as a result of such breach or any deficiency under the Collateral Tests at the time of repayment or replacement. Compliance with the Collateral Tests is also a condition to the discretionary sale of pledged loan assets by the Company.\nPriority of Payments. During the Revolving Period, the priority of payments provisions of the Credit Facility require, after payment of specified fees and expenses and any necessary funding of the Unfunded Exposure Account, that collections of principal from the loan assets and, to the extent that these are insufficient, collections of interest from the loan assets, be applied on each payment date to payment of outstanding borrowings if the Borrowing Base Test, the Overcollateralization Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio would not otherwise be met. Similarly, following termination of the Revolving Period, collections of interest are required to be applied, after payment of certain fees and expenses, to cure any deficiencies in the Borrowing Base Test, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the Overcollateralization Ratio as of the relevant payment date.\nReserve Account. The Credit Facility requires the Company to set aside an amount equal to the sum of accrued interest, commitment fees and administrative agent fees due and payable on the next succeeding three payment dates (or corresponding to three payment periods). If for any monthly period during which fees and other payments accrue, the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets which do not pay cash interest at least quarterly exceeds 15.0% of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of \u201celigible\u201d pledged loan assets, the Company is required to set aside such interest and fees due and payable on the next succeeding six payment dates. Amounts in the reserve account can be applied solely to the payment of administrative agent fees, commitment fees, accrued and unpaid interest and any breakage costs payable to the lenders.\nUnfunded Exposure Account. With respect to revolver or delayed draw loan assets, the Company is required to set aside in a designated account (the \u201cUnfunded Exposure Account\u201d) 100.0% of its outstanding and undrawn funding commitments with respect to such loan assets. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded at the time the Company acquires a revolver or delayed draw loan asset and requests a related borrowing under the Credit Facility. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded through a combination of proceeds of the requested borrowing and other Company funds, and if for any reason such amounts are insufficient, through application of the priority of payment provisions described above.\nOperating Expenses. The priority of payments provision of the Credit Facility provides for the payment of certain operating expenses of the Company out of collections on principal and interest during the Revolving Period and out of collections on interest following the termination of the Revolving Period in accordance with the priority established in such provision. The operating expenses payable pursuant to the priority of payment provisions is limited to $350,000 for each monthly payment date or $2.5 million for the immediately preceding period of twelve consecutive monthly payment dates. This ceiling can be increased by the lesser of 5.0% or the percentage increase in the fair market value of all the Company's assets only on the first monthly payment date to occur after each one-year anniversary following the closing of the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of a Manager Event (described below), the consent of the administrative agent is required in order to pay operating expenses through the priority of payments provision.\nEvents of Default. The Credit Facility contains certain negative covenants, customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants and events of default. The Credit Facility does not contain grace periods for breach by the Company of certain covenants, including, without limitation, preservation of existence, negative pledge, change of name or jurisdiction and separate legal entity status of the Company covenants and certain other customary covenants.

Conditions to Acquisitions and Pledges of Loan Assets. The Credit Facility imposes certain additional conditions to the acquisition and pledge of additional loan assets. Among other things, the Company may not acquire additional loan assets without the prior written consent of the administrative agent until such time that the administrative agent indicates in writing its satisfaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors' policies, personnel and processes relating to the loan assets.\nFees and Expenses. The Company paid certain fees and reimbursed Madison Capital Funding LLC for the aggregate amount of all documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, incurred by Madison Capital Funding LLC in connection with the Credit Facility and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated thereunder up to and as of the date of closing of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates. These amounts totaled $2.0 million.\nOn February 24, 2012, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 expand the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $40.0 million to $45.0 million; \n \u2022 extend the period during which we may make and repay borrowings under the Credit Facility from July 30, 2013 to February 24, 2015 (the \u201cRevolving Period\u201d). The Revolving Period may, upon the occurrence of an event of default, by action of the lenders or automatically, be terminated. All borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Facility are due and payable five years after the end of the Revolving Period; and \n \u2022 remove the condition that we may not acquire additional loan assets without the prior written consent of the administrative agent.  On September 17, 2014, we entered into a second amendment to the Revolving Facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 extend the commitment termination date from February 24, 2015 to September 17, 2017; \n \u2022 extend the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from February 24, 2020 to September 17, 2022 (unless terminated sooner upon certain events); \n \u2022 reduce the applicable margin rate on base rate borrowings from 4.50% to 3.75%, and on LIBOR borrowings from 5.50% to 4.75%; and \n \u2022 reduce the floor on base rate borrowings from 3.00% to 2.25%; and on LIBOR borrowings from 2.00% to 1.25%.  On May 18, 2017, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 extend the commitment termination date from September 17, 2017 to September 17, 2020; \n \u2022 extend the final maturity date of the Credit Facility from September 17, 2022 to September 17, 2025; \n \u2022 reduce the floor on base rate borrowings from 2.25% to 2.00%; \n \u2022 reduce the floor on LIBOR borrowings from 1.25% to 1.00%; and \n \u2022 reduce the commitment fee rate from 0.75% to 0.50% for any period during which the ratio of advances outstanding to aggregate commitments, expressed as a percentage, is greater than or equal to 50%.  On April 24, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC to, among other things:\n \u2022 permit certain amendments related to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPermitted PPP Amendment\u201d) to Loan Asset Documents; \n \u2022 exclude certain debt and interest amounts allowed by the Permitted PPP Amendments from certain calculations related to Net Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio and EBITDA; and \n \u2022 exclude such Permitted PPP Amendments from constituting a Material Modification. \nAs of February 29, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (which are discussed below). As of February 28, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. Our borrowing base under the Credit Facility at February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 was $35.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively.\nOur asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 607.1% as of February 29, 2020 and 234.5% as of February 28, 2019.\nSBA-guaranteed debentures\nIn addition, we, through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, sought and obtained licenses from the SBA to operate an SBIC. In this regard, on March 28, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC LP, received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 and on August 14, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP, also received a license. SBICs are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.\nThe SBIC license allows our SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.\nSBA regulations previously limited the amount that our SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. This maximum has been increased by SBA regulators for new licenses to $175.0 million of SBA debentures when it has at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital. The new license will provide up to $175.0 million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA-guaranteed debentures. The SBIC LP and SBIC II LP are regulated by the SBA. As a result of the 2016 omnibus spending bill signed into law in December 2015, the maximum amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that affiliated SBIC funds can have outstanding was increased from $225.0 million to $350.0 million. Our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries are able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including but not limited to an examination by the SBA. With this license approval, Saratoga will grow its SBA relationship from $150.0 million to $325.0 million of committed capital.\nWe received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. On April 16, 2018, as permitted by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, our non-interested board of directors approved of our becoming subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150.0% from 200% under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, as amended. The 150.0% asset coverage ratio became effective on April 16, 2019.\nAs of February 29, 2020, our SBIC LP subsidiary had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding and our SBIC II LP subsidiary had $50.0 million in regulatory capital and did not have any SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.\nUnsecured notes\nIn May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes for net proceeds of $46.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters' full exercise of their overallotment option. Interest on these 2020 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, at a rate of 7.50% per year, beginning August 15, 2013. The 2020 Notes mature on May 31, 2020 and since May 31, 2016, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we agreed to the following covenants for the period of time during which the 2020 Notes are outstanding:\n \u2022 we will not violate (whether or not we are subject to) Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC.

Currently these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 200.0% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase. \nThe 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017 and are no longer listed on the NYSE.\nOn May 29, 2015, we entered into a Debt Distribution Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes through an ATM offering.

Interest on the 2025 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, at a rate of 6.25% per year, beginning November 30, 2018.

The 2025 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cSAF\u201d with a par value of $25.00 per share.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company completed a re-opening and up-sizing of its existing 2025 Notes by issuing an additional $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of $19.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.6 million and discount of $0.2 million.
