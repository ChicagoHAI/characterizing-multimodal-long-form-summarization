MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nWe are a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood preservation chemicals, and carbon compounds. Our products and services are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end-markets, including the railroad, specialty chemical, utility, residential lumber, agriculture, aluminum, steel, rubber, and construction industries. We serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network, with manufacturing facilities located in North America, South America, Australasia, China and Europe.\nWe operate three principal businesses: Railroad and Utility Products and Services ( RUPS\u201d), Performance Chemicals ( PC\u201d) and Carbon Materials and Chemicals ( CMC\u201d).\nThrough our RUPS business, we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the North American railroads. Our other treated wood products include utility poles for the electric and telephone utility industries in the United States and Australia. We also provide rail joint bar products as well as various services to the railroad industry. In April 2018, we re-entered the North American utility pole market with the acquisition of Cox Industries, Inc., which has been renamed Koppers Utility and Industrial Products Inc. ( UIP\u201d). UIP manufactures and sells utility poles and construction and marine pilings through a network of eight manufacturing facilities and 19 distribution yards located throughout the United States. In February 2018, Koppers Inc. acquired M.A. Energy Resources, LLC, a business related to the recovery of used crossties, which was renamed Koppers Recovery Resources LLC ( KRR\u201d) subsequent to the acquisition.\nThrough our PC business, we believe that we are the global leader in developing, manufacturing and marketing wood preservation chemicals and wood treatment technologies for use in the pressure treating of lumber for residential, industrial and agricultural applications. Our CMC business processes coal tar into a variety of products, including creosote, carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock, naphthalene and phthalic anhydride, which are intermediate materials necessary in the pressure treatment of wood, the production of aluminum, the production of carbon black, the production of high-strength concrete, and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals, respectively.\nOutlook\nTrend Overview\nOur businesses and results of operations are affected by various competitive and other factors including (i) the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products, including the impact of imported products from competitors in certain regions where we operate; (ii) raw material pricing and availability, in particular the cost and availability of hardwood lumber for railroad crossties and softwood lumber for utility poles, scrap copper prices, and the cost and amount of coal tar available in global markets, which is negatively affected by reductions in blast furnace steel production; (iii) volatility in oil prices, which impacts the cost of coal tar and certain other raw materials, as well as selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock, phthalic anhydride, and naphthalene; (iv) competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets; and (v) changes in foreign exchange rates.\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services\nWe provide our customers with treated and untreated wood products, rail joint bars and services primarily for the railroad markets in the United States and Canada. In addition, we supply treated utility poles for the utility sector in the United States and Australia. The primary end-markets for RUPS is the North American railroad industry, which has an installed base of approximately 700 million wood crossties, and the investor-owned utility industry which utilizes wooden distribution and transmission poles. Both crossties and utility poles require periodic replacement. Historically, North American demand for crossties had been in the range of 22-25 million annually. However, the crosstie replacement market has been significantly lower in recent years. According to the Railway Tie Association ( RTA\u201d), Class I railroads estimated crosstie installations of approximately 16 million in 2018 followed by a similar amount in 2019. For distribution poles, the demand has historically been in the range of two to three million annually. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services primarily for railroad bridges in the U.S. and Canada.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nThe supply of untreated crossties can vary at times based upon weather conditions in addition to other factors. We have a nationwide wood procurement team that maintains close working relationships with a network of sawmills. We procure untreated crossties, either on behalf of our customers, or for future treating. We also procure switch ties and various other types of lumber used for railroad bridges and crossings. Untreated crossties go through a six- to nine-month air seasoning process before they are ready to be pressure treated. After the air seasoning process is complete, the crossties are pressure treated using creosote-only treatment or a combined creosote and borate treatment. During any given year, there is a seasonal effect in the winter months on our crosstie business depending on weather conditions for harvesting lumber and installation.\nIn 2018, the major companies in the rail industry again substantially reduced both operating and capital spending from peak spending levels, which had a negative impact on sales of various products and services that we provide to that industry. Current year revenues and profitability reflected a decline year-over-year due to the effects of lower demand caused by continued reductions in capital budgets for most North American Class I railroads. We currently supply all seven of the North American Class I railroads and have long-standing relationships with these customers. Approximately 70 percent of our North American sales are under long-term contracts and we believe that we are positioned to maintain or grow our current market position.\nAccording to the Association of American Railroads, the level of business activity for the railroad industry is dependent on, to a large extent, trends occurring in other sectors of the economy. In the recent past, the Class I railroads were highly dependent on the oil and gas and coal mining industries. Currently, the railroads are more correlated to trade relations, commodity prices and interest rates. Rail traffic has continued to be relatively positive, with intermodal especially strong due to its close relation to consumer spending. However, there has been weakness in some commodity categories. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total U.S. carload traffic was up 1.8 percent from last year while intermodal units were up 5.5 percent from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, combined U.S. traffic for carloads and intermodal units was 3.7 percent higher than prior year. Although year-over-year rail traffic has steadily increased during the past several years, the amount of heavy-haul loads such as coal and fracking sands have declined significantly from historical levels. As a result, this translates into lighter-weight loads having less wear on tracks and ties.\nOver an economic cycle, the long-term prognosis for the railroad industry and the products and services that we provide to it are generally favorable. However, in the near-term, railroad customers have scaled back and are focusing on reducing their operating costs and working capital. As a result, the demand for treated crossties for 2018 has been relatively flat to lower than the prior year. In 2019, we expect demand to stabilize and modestly improve in the second half of the year, contingent on the availability of lumber for untreated crosstie production.\nIn terms of raw material, there was less available inventory of untreated crossties from the saw mills during 2018 and lumber prices increased dramatically due to a wet spring and summer affecting production. Currently, the RTA reports that the hardwood lumber demand has been softening with sharp declines in hardwood lumber sales volumes due to changing economic conditions in China. In addition, the potential effects from impending tariffs on trade between China and the U.S. may negatively impact the hardwood industry and the availability of lumber. For much of 2018, we experienced a tightness in the supply of untreated crosstie supply which challenged our ability to procure needed inventory. However, that seems to be alleviated somewhat as demand from China has softened. In the early part of 2019, many saw mills are again experiencing challenges related to unfavorable weather conditions hampering the procurement of untreated crossties. To the extent that we can build our untreated tie inventory, we anticipate having higher levels of dry crosstie inventory ready for treatment.\nIn addition, over the last several years, certain Class I railroads have shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. Going forward, we estimate that the remaining potential impact of this transition could be a further increase of working capital by approximately $50 million primarily due to higher inventory, and the associated revenue cycle could be temporarily extended for approximately six to nine months, for approximately $50 million in total. The actual timing of this impact will be dependent on the date, if at all, the remaining customer makes the transition.\nFrom a long-term perspective, there remains a need for sustained investment in infrastructure and capacity expansion. We believe that with our vertical integration capabilities in wood treatment and strong customer relationships, we will ultimately benefit from increased demand.\nPerformance Chemicals\nThe largest geographic market for wood treating chemicals sold by our PC business is in North America, and the largest application for our products is the residential remodeling market. We also have a market presence in Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. We believe that PC is the largest global manufacturer and supplier of water-based wood preservatives and wood specialty additives to treaters who supply pressure treated wood products to large\nretailers and independent lumber dealers. These retailers and dealers, in turn, serve the residential, agricultural and industrial pressure-treated wood market. Our primary products are copper-based wood preservatives, including micronized copper azole ( MicroPro\u00ae\u201d) and micronized pigments ( MicroShades\u00ae\u201d).\nIn North America, we are vertically integrated due to our manufacturing capabilities for copper compounds for our copper-based wood preservatives. We believe our vertical integration is part of our proprietary processes and reflects an important competitive advantage. Applications for these products include decking, fencing, utility poles, construction lumber and other outdoor structures.\nAs most of the products sold by PC are copper-based products, changes in the price and availability of copper can have a significant impact on product pricing and margins. We attempt to moderate the variability in copper pricing over time by entering into hedging transactions for the majority of our copper needs, which primarily range from six months up to 36 months. These hedges typically match expected customer purchases and receive hedge accounting treatment. From time to time, we enter into forward transactions based upon long-term forecasted needs of copper. These forward positions are typically marked to market on a quarterly basis.\nProduct demand for our PC business has historically been closely associated with consumer spending on home repair and remodeling projects, and therefore, trends in existing home sales serve as a leading indicator. Overall, the market for existing homes continues to show mixed signals. According to the National Association of Realtors\u00ae ( NAR\u201d), existing home sales declined in December after two consecutive months of increases. None of the four major U.S. regions saw a gain in sales activity in the month. The NAR reported that total existing-home sales decreased 6.4 percent from November and was down 10.3 percent from a year ago.\nAccording to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d) reported by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the annual growth in the national market for home improvement and repair has been revised lower and is now expected to grow 5.1 percent compared to 7.5 percent previously. Even so, LIRA projects that spending on these areas is still anticipated to expand to more than $350 billion nationally.\nThe Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index\u00ae decreased in December to 128.1, down from 136.4 in November. Consumers' assessment of current conditions has declined, which is attributed to an increasing concern that the pace of economic growth will begin moderating in the first half of 2019.\nFrom a margin perspective, our profitability has been unfavorably impacted by rising raw material costs, primarily due to copper prices which began to trend higher in 2017 and continuing into 2018 but has pulled back from highs reached in the first half of 2018. Our strategy is to hedge a majority of our requirements over a two-to-three year time frame in order to provide short-term certainty and visibility of our cost structure by lessening the impact that may arise in commodity markets. In a rising copper price environment such as in the past eighteen months, our average hedged prices have increased from prior year and we expect that to continue in 2019. We have begun hedging for our input needs in 2020 and as long as copper prices remain at current levels, we anticipate a year-over-year benefit for that time period. We have implemented pricing actions, where possible, to partially offset the impact of higher input costs.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals\nThe primary products produced by CMC are creosote, which is a registered pesticide in the U.S. and used primarily in the pressure treatment of railroad crossties, and carbon pitch, which is sold primarily to the aluminum industry for the production of carbon anodes used in the smelting of aluminum. We have reduced capacity in our CMC plants in North America and Europe over the past several years to levels required to meet creosote demand in North America for the treatment of railroad crossties. We currently supply our North American RUPS business with 100 percent of its creosote requirements. As discussed in the RUPS outlook, there has been a decrease starting in 2017 with respect to spending for railroad infrastructure. This results in a shift in excess distillate production to the commodity carbon black feedstock market until demand stabilizes for creosote and eventually returns to higher levels.\nWhile the sale of carbon pitch remains a significant portion of our sales volume, the reduction of aluminum smelting capacity in the United States, Australia and Western Europe has led to sharply lower demand for carbon pitch over the past several years. Accordingly, we have experienced significantly lower sales volumes due to the reduction in aluminum production in parts of the world where the majority of our production facilities are located. However, beginning in 2018, aluminum production in the U.S. increased to some extent as tariffs are being imposed on certain imported steel and aluminum products that has stimulated restarts of previously idled capacity. This development has resulted in additional demand for carbon pitch in the United States that can likely only be sustained through a continuation of current trade policy.\nThe availability of coal tar, the primary raw material for our CMC business, is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production. As the global steel industry, excluding Asia, has reduced the production of steel using metallurgical coke, the volumes of coal tar have also been reduced. For the past decade, the coal tar distillation industry has operated in an excess capacity mode, which further increased the competition for a limited amount of coal tar in North America. Over the\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\npast three years we have consolidated our operating footprint and significantly lowered production levels at the same time that we added distribution assets to move finished products from Europe to the U.S. more efficiently. As a result, our raw material needs in North America have been significantly less than historically required. In early 2017, we entered into several new long-term supply agreements to further lower our exposure to coal tar availability risk and volatile end markets.\nIn recent quarters, there has been an overall tightening market supply of coal tar and carbon pitch in China and it has put upward pressure on both raw materials and finished product pricing. This is due to an ongoing shutdown of older steel and coking capacity that does not meet environmental and emissions requirements. In turn, the shutdowns have resulted in increased demand for products requiring coal tar pitch, including needle coke used for producing electrodes that go into electric arc steel production, which is the primary market that we serve in China. As a result, our coal-tar distillation facility constructed in 2015 serving those markets has a competitive advantage. During 2018, pricing for coal tar products in the region moderated but remains relatively strong compared to prior year. For the external markets served by our CMC business, we anticipate that while Europe, North America and Australia will benefit from favorable demand levels, the margin will be negatively impacted by higher cost of raw materials in 2019.\nWith respect to our largest customer in China, we believe that the pricing we have received has been understated for a number of quarterly periods. While we continue to engage in discussions with this customer and hope to resolve the disagreement in accordance with certain provisions in our contractual relationship, we have not recognized any incremental revenue associated with the higher price that we believe is accurate. Therefore, our sales and margin in China were negatively impacted in 2018 due to lower volume requirements from this customer.\nGoing forward, the stronger demand has had a positive effect on pricing for the key raw material that we provide to this industry.\nCMC Restructuring Initiatives\nWe embarked on a plan to restructure our CMC operating footprint that reduced our global number of coal tar distillation facilities from the eleven that existed as of January 1, 2014 to four in total. The remaining facilities are located in regions where we believe we hold key competitive advantages that allow us to better serve our global customers: Stickney, Illinois; Nyborg, Denmark; Mayfield, Australia; and Jiangsu Province, China.\nAs a result of the reduction in operating capacity at the seven closed or sold coal tar distillation facilities, we have incurred substantial restructuring and impairment costs over the last four years. As a result of these initiatives, we expect additional restructuring and related charges to earnings of $5.0 million to $7.0 million through 2020. The overall expected future cash requirements for the CMC plant closures are estimated to be approximately $20 million through 2021. There may be additional curtailments or closures at our other CMC facilities as part of our efforts to reduce our cost structure and improve capacity utilization in our business. In October 2018, we completed the sale of our Clairton, Pennsylvania facility and, in doing so, transferred cash along with substantially all assets at the facility to the purchaser in exchange for the purchaser assuming certain historical and future obligations, including full responsibility for facility decommissioning, demolition and site restoration.\nThrough these restructuring initiatives, we are significantly transforming our CMC business model by streamlining the operating footprint and reducing our primary reliance on and exposure to the carbon pitch markets. In addition, the construction of a new naphthalene unit at our Stickney, Illinois, facility, which we completed commissioning in the third quarter of 2018, is anticipated to result in additional production efficiencies and cost savings going forward. All intermediate feedstocks are now being processed in Stickney as the new unit is now fully online. We believe that the extensive and ongoing efforts to reduce our fixed cost structure will result in a sustainable improvement in earnings in addition to lower volatility in cash flow.\nSeasonality and Effects of Weather on Operations\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, including inclement weather conditions, which in the past have affected operating results. Operations at some of our facilities have at times been reduced during the winter months. Moreover, demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather. As a result of the foregoing, we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Historically, our operating results have been significantly lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 634.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 512.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 420.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 411.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 655.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,710.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,475.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRUPS net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $122.2 million or 24 percent compared to the prior year. The sales increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of UIP and KRR in the current year as well as volume increases in the commercial tie and rail joint markets in the current year. These increases were offset by lower treating volumes of Class I crossties. Sales of Class I crossties declined by $61.7 million. This was primarily due to decreased spending in the rail industry, particularly the Class I market as certain Class I railroads have shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. More recently, a lack of dry crosstie inventory has also contributed to reduced treating volumes.\nPC net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $8.8 million or two percent compared to the prior year. The slightly higher sales were due primarily to higher volumes in Australasia for light organic solvent preservatives as well as a favorable mix of pricing and demand in North America. During the year, price volatility in the lumber market limited customer inventory and reduced customer demand for copper-based wood preservatives.\nCMC net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $103.7 million or 19 percent compared to the prior year due mainly to higher sales prices for carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock and naphthalene partially offset by reduced volumes in North America and Europe. In Australia and Europe, higher sales prices for carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock were driven primarily by higher raw material cost and increases in global benchmark oil pricing.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 80 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 78 percent in the prior year. Higher gross margins for CMC were driven by higher sales prices for carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock and naphthalene. These were offset by lower gross margins for PC driven by higher raw material costs and lower gross margins for RUPS due to reduced sales volumes of crossties in the Class I market combined with reduced margins as a result of higher raw material supply costs.\nDepreciation and amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.0 million higher when compared to the prior year period due mainly to assets placed in service over the past year related to our new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois along with depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions in the current year period.\nLoss on sale of assets of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects sales of our coal tar distillation facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania and our specialty chemicals business in the United Kingdom within our CMC segment as well as a sale of assets in the United Kingdom within our PC segment.\nImpairment and restructuring charges were $12.2 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2018 due mainly to prior year charges for restructuring-related storage tank decommissioning costs and accelerated depreciation for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facilities in Clairton, Pennsylvania and Follansbee, West Virginia. Current year charges consist primarily of remaining restructuring-related costs and depreciation at our Follansbee, West Virginia facility.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $29.1 million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to $18.5 million of incremental costs within KRR and UIP, $6.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and $3.3 million from higher compensation expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.8 million higher than the prior year period primarily due to the higher average debt level to fund our acquisitions of UIP and KRR.\nLoss on pension settlement was $10.0 million in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 100 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $3.1 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $1.2 million related to this transaction.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed an irrevocable transaction with an insurance company to annuitize approximately $31 million of retiree pension obligations in its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for a selected\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\ngroup of retirees. The transaction was funded by transferring a similar amount of assets from the pension plan to the insurance company. Subsequent to this transfer, the insurance company has assumed all remaining pension obligations associated with these retirees. The Company recorded a pension settlement loss of $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13.3 million. In 2017, all of our senior notes due 2019 were repurchased at a premium to carrying value and accordingly, we realized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.0 million consisting of $7.3 million for bond premium and bond tender expenses and $2.7 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we repaid our term loan in full and entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility and recorded a loss of $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.0 million lower when compared to the prior year period.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act also requires an income inclusion of foreign corporations' global intangible low-taxed income or GILTI and also introduces a limitation on the amount of interest expense that is deductible.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an estimate of this one-time transition tax and recorded a charge to income tax expense of $13.1 million. As a result of the corporate rate reduction to 21 percent, the Company recorded a charge of $7.4 million to adjust the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the impact of the one-time transition tax and the adjustment to our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and recorded an additional $4.7 million of income tax expense.\nThe Company has included the impact of the GILTI inclusion and the limitation on deductible interest expense in its 2018 tax provision. Although the interest expense deduction that is disallowed in the current year can be carried forward to future years, the Company has concluded that, in the foreseeable future, it will not be able to benefit from the disallowed interest expense deduction. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded against this deferred tax asset. The Company has recorded income tax expense of $15.6 million for the impact of the GILTI inclusion and the limitation on deductible interest expense.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 47.4 percent. The effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to the impact of the Tax Act partially offset with the reversal of a valuation allowance for a subsidiary in China that will be able to realize its net operating losses.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.1 percent. The effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35.0 percent due to the impact of the Tax Act. This increase due to the Tax Act is partially offset by a significant amount of foreign pre-tax earnings that are taxed at income tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit as a percentage of net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRUPS operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $20.3 million or 77 percent compared to the prior year.

Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by reduced treating volumes of crossties to Class I customers. Additionally, we have experienced margin pressure from higher costs of raw materials from saw mills due to increased demand. The segment was also negatively impacted by $6.0 million in the current year period due to inventory purchase price fair value adjustments from the UIP acquisition.\nPC operating profit decreased by $35.2 million or 49 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for PC decreased to 8.6 percent from 17.4 percent in the prior year. Higher raw material prices, selling, general and administrative expenses, and transportation costs along with short-term supply disruptions more than offset our slight increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the current year period was unfavorably impacted by a net amount of $16.0 million due to changes in unrealized gains and losses from our copper swap contracts as compared to the prior year period.\nCMC operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $42.7 million or 153 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for CMC increased to 10.8 percent from 5.1 percent in the prior year period. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively affected by higher sales prices for most products and regions within the segment, primarily attributed to carbon pitch, and a more streamlined and efficient cost structure. These positive results were partially offset by reduced margins in China due to the impact of a temporary plant curtailment of our largest customer, lower sales volumes in North America, Australasia and Europe and higher raw material costs in Australasia and Europe.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 512.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 411.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 393.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 436.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,475.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,416.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $73.9 million or 13 percent compared to the prior year. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes of crossties and railroad bridge services, partially offset by higher sales volumes of utility products. Sales of crossties and railroad bridge services declined by $72.3 million. The reduction in treated crossties and structure services is attributed to lower spending in the rail industry across both the Class I and commercial markets. In addition, commercial crosstie pricing has been reduced due to an over-supply of crossties in the commercial market. Sales of utility products increased by $4.0 million due to increased demand for structural timber in Australia.\nPerformance Chemicals net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $17.8 million or five percent compared to the prior year. The sales increase was due primarily to higher North American sales volumes for some copper-based wood preservatives and additives. Higher sales volumes were driven primarily by favorable market trends in the repair and remodeling markets and existing home sales as well as treated wood dealers stocking and selling treated wood with higher preservative retention levels. These gains were offset in part by higher customer development costs, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales, compared to the prior year.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $115.4 million or 26 percent compared to the prior year due mainly to higher sales prices for carbon black feedstock, carbon pitch and coal tar chemicals with higher sales volumes for carbon black feedstock and coal tar chemicals, partially offset by lower creosote volumes. Our strategy is to sell as much distillate production to the higher value wood preservative market, however there was a reduction in creosote volume driven by lower demand for treated crossties during 2017. The excess distillate was sold as carbon black feedstock. Sales of coal tar chemicals increased over the prior year period due to increases in sales volumes and pricing of phthalic anhydride and naphthalene. The increases, in part, were driven by the effect of higher orthoxylene prices, which favorably impact phthalic anhydride market prices. Higher sales prices for carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock in Australasia and Europe were driven primarily by reduced supply in those regions.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 78 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 80 percent in the prior year due mainly to higher gross margins for CMC driven by lower raw material and shipping costs and higher sales prices in certain regions. In addition, a sales mix shift for PC improved our results as higher gross margins were driven by increased sales volumes in higher margin product lines. This more than offset lower sales volumes and\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\ngross margins from RUPS due to reduced sales volumes of crossties and railroad services combined with reduced margins in the commercial crosstie market as a result of inventory over-supply.\nDepreciation and amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.1 million lower when compared to the prior year period due mainly to a reduction in assets, excluding assets under construction, related to our shutdown of distillation facilities in the United States and United Kingdom.\nGain on sale of assets of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected the sale of our CMC tar distillation properties and assets in the United Kingdom in July 2016.\nImpairment and restructuring charges were $3.9 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2017 due mainly to a prior year accrual for exited real estate lease obligations, net of estimated sublease revenue, at our closed coal tar distillation facility in Uithoorn, the Netherlands, as well as severance charges related to our closed coal tar distillation CMC facilities in the United Kingdom and impairment charges for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Current year charges consist of restructuring-related storage tank decommissioning costs and accelerated depreciation for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facilities in Clairton, Pennsylvania and Follansbee, West Virginia.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.9 million higher when compared to the prior year due mainly to increases in consulting costs and stock-based compensation expense offset by decreases in customer development costs.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.3 million lower when compared to the prior year as a result of reduced average debt levels and reduced interest rates related to our 2025 Notes and our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLoss on pension settlement for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million higher when compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 100 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $3.1 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $1.2 million related to this transaction.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed an irrevocable transaction with an insurance company to annuitize approximately $31 million of retiree pension obligations in its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for a selected group of retirees. The transaction was funded by transferring a similar amount of assets from the pension plan to the insurance company. Subsequent to this transfer, the insurance company has assumed all remaining pension obligations associated with these retirees. The Company recorded a pension settlement loss of $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 375 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $13.9 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13.3 million higher when compared to the prior year period. In the current year period, all of our senior notes due 2019 were repurchased at a premium to carrying value and accordingly, we realized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.0 million consisting of $7.3 million for bond premium and bond tender expenses and $2.7 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we repaid our term loan in full and entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility and recorded a loss of $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $17.6 million higher when compared to the prior year period. The increase in tax expense is primarily due to the Tax Act.\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws to deferred taxes are accounted for in the period of legislative enactment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As a result of the corporate rate reduction to 21 percent, the Company recorded a charge of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from reducing the value of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nThe Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 that have not previously been subject to federal tax. The Company recorded an estimate of this one-time transition tax and recorded a charge to income tax expense of $13.1 million.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.1 percent. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 without the effect of the Tax Act were 14.1 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to an increase in foreign pre-tax earnings that are taxed at more favorable rates. Additionally, in the prior period, we incurred losses in certain foreign subsidiaries that did not generate a tax benefit, which increased our effective tax rate for that prior period.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $27.9 million or 52 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 5.1 percent from 9.2 percent. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by reduced sales volumes of crossties and railroad services combined with reduced margins in the commercial crosstie market as a result of inventory over-supply in the commercial market. The negative impact from these factors was slightly offset by favorable volumes and sales mix of rail joint products and utility products.\nPerformance Chemicals operating profit increased by $7.9 million or 12 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for PC increased to 17.4 percent from 16.1 percent in the prior year. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted due primarily to higher North American sales volumes for copper-based wood preservatives. Sales volumes have improved due to favorable market trends in the repair and remodeling markets and existing home sales. Higher sales volumes were also driven primarily by changes in treated wood product application standards in 2016 resulting in treated wood dealers stocking and selling more high retention ground contact treated wood, which moderated in 2017 as dealer inventory has been sufficiently restocked with higher retention treated wood. Although we hedge the majority of our copper purchases, higher copper prices partially offset our increases in sales and operating profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $50.6 million or 224 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for CMC increased to 5.1 percent from a loss of 5.2 percent in the prior year period. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected by lower raw material and shipping costs and higher sales prices in certain regions. In addition to this, in recent quarters there has been an overall tightened market supply of coal tar and carbon pitch in China. This is due to an ongoing shutdown of steel and coking capacity that does not meet environmental and emissions requirements. The pricing for coal tar products in the region has increased significantly and as a result, our recently constructed coal-tar distillation facility serving those markets has a competitive advantage. These positive impacts were partially offset by lower sales volumes in North America and certain costs incurred, such as asset retirement charges, as we continue to consolidate our North American footprint.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net decrease of $23.5 million in cash provided by operations was due primarily to higher working capital usage of $20.3 million compared to the prior year period principally as a result of an increase in inventory of $18.3 million as one of our Class I railroad customers within RUPS has shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. An additional increase in inventory from CMC is due to higher raw material prices.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $119.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease of $17.7 million in cash from operations was due primarily to higher working capital usage compared to the prior year period principally as a result of an increase in accounts receivable in the current year period due to an increase in sales.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used for investing activities of $319.9 million is primarily due to $264.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions as well as incremental current year capital expenditures to expand production capacity at PC in the United States and continued spending on the new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois. Both of these projects were substantially completed by the end of 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net cash used by investing activities of $2.8 million is primarily due to capital expenditures to expand production capacity at PC in the United States and continued spending on the new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois offset by cash proceeds of $9.5 million from the loan repayment by Tangshan Kailuan Koppers Carbon Chemical Company Limited ( TKK\u201d).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $282.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash provided by financing activities in the current period reflected net borrowings of $314.6 million to primarily fund acquisitions and capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock of $31.8 million. The cash provided by financing activities in the prior year period reflected net borrowings of revolving credit of $54.3 million and net repayments of long-term debt of $46.7 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.0 million from the issuance of new debt and repurchases of common stock of $5.2 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities in the current period reflected net borrowings of revolving credit of $54.3 million offset by net repayments of long-term debt of $46.7 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.0 million from the issuance of new debt and repurchases of common stock of $5.2 million. The cash used in financing activities in the prior year period reflected net repayments of revolving credit and long-term debt of $29.7 million and $31.7 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has a $600.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $100.0 million secured term loan (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of April 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is variable and is based on LIBOR.\nRestrictions on Dividends to Koppers Holdings\nKoppers Holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, including the payment of any declared dividend of Koppers Holdings. The Revolving Credit Facility prohibits Koppers Inc. from making dividend payments to Koppers Holdings unless (1) such dividend payments are permitted by the indenture governing Koppers Inc.'s $500 million Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d), (2) no event of default or potential default has occurred or is continuing under our Revolving Credit Facility, and (3) we are in pro forma compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant after giving effect to such dividend. The indenture governing the 2025 Notes restricts Koppers Inc.'s ability to finance our payment of dividends if (1) a default has occurred or would result from such financing, (2) Koppers Inc., or a restricted subsidiary of Koppers Inc. which is not a guarantor under the indenture, is not able to incur additional indebtedness (as defined in the indenture), and (3) the sum of all restricted payments (as defined in the indenture) have exceeded the permitted amount (which we refer to as the basket\u201d) at such point in time.\nThe basket is governed by a formula based on the sum of a beginning amount, plus or minus a percentage of Koppers Inc.'s consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture), plus the net proceeds of Koppers Inc.'s qualified stock issuance or conversions of debt to qualified stock, plus the net proceeds from the sale of or a reduction in an investment (as defined in the indenture) or the value of the assets of an unrestricted subsidiary which is designated a restricted subsidiary. At December 31, 2018, the basket totaled $130.2 million. Notwithstanding such restrictions, the indenture governing the 2025 Notes permits an additional aggregate amount of $0.30 per share each fiscal quarter to finance dividends on the capital stock of Koppers Holdings, whether or not there is any basket availability, provided that at the time of such payment, no default in the indenture has occurred or would result from financing the dividends.\nIn addition, certain required coverage ratios in Koppers Inc.'s Revolving Credit Facility may restrict the ability of Koppers Inc. to pay dividends. Koppers Holdings last declared a dividend in November 2014 and does not expect to declare any dividends for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Koppers Inc., Koppers Holdings and their material domestic subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants for Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries that limit capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, liens, dividends and investments or acquisitions. In addition, such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $179.0 million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments. As of December 31, 2018, $31.9 million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our estimated liquidity as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount available under revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 179.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total estimated liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 219.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Cash includes approximately $36.9 million held by foreign subsidiaries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur estimated liquidity was $263.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nOur remaining need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service, purchase commitments and operating leases, as well as working capital, capital maintenance programs, liability transfers of closed facilities and the funding of plant consolidation and rationalizations. We may also use cash to pursue other potential strategic acquisitions or voluntary pension plan contributions. Capital expenditures in 2019, excluding acquisitions, if any, are expected to total approximately $30 million and are expected to be funded by cash from operations.\nSchedule of Certain Contractual Obligations\nThe following table details our projected payments for our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.

We expect defined benefit plan contributions to total approximately $3.6 million in 2019. Estimated funding obligations are determined by asset performance, workforce and retiree demographics, tax and employment laws and other actuarial assumptions which may change the annual funding obligations in addition to decisions to fund in excess of statutorily required amounts. The funded status of our defined benefit plans is disclosed in Note 15 in our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was $7.0 million of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.

Our continued ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, however, excluding possible acquisitions, we currently expect that our net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements over the next twelve months.\nOther Matters\nForeign Operations and Foreign Currency Transactions\nWe are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations due to our foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a decrease to comprehensive income of $25.6 million, an increase of $17.0 million and a decrease of $4.3 million, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency which is different from the currency used by the entity to prepare its financial statements. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were $0.6 million, $(2.3) million and $(1.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nInformation regarding recently issued accounting guidance is contained in Note 3 New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Our management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue upon the completion of performance obligations under contracts with our customers and when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. Substantially all of our contracts with our customers are ship and invoice arrangements where revenue is recognized when we complete our performance obligations and transfer control to the customer. We also have certain arrangements where revenue is recognized under the contract where control of the goods or services had been transferred to the customer prior to shipment. Revenue recognition generally occurs at the point of shipment; however in certain circumstances as shipping terms dictate, we transfer control and revenue is recognized at the point of destination. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.\nWe also recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer. Service revenue, consisting primarily of wood treating services, is recognized at the time the service is provided and the performance obligation is satisfied.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In making this assessment, management relies on various factors, including operating results, estimated future cash flows, and business plans. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Because management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated.\nGoodwill valuations are performed using projected operating results of the relevant reporting units. We have three reporting units for purposes of goodwill evaluation. These units consist of our PC operating segment, our Railroad Products and Services reporting unit and our Utility Products reporting unit. Railroad Products and Services and Utility Products are one level below our RUPS operating segment. The Railroad Products and Services reporting unit primarily serves the rail industry in the United States and the Utility Products reporting unit serves the utility industries in the United States and Australia.\nGoodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 is $296.5 million. We determined that no impairment of goodwill at any of our reporting units was required as of December 31, 2018.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Identifiable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We have identifiable intangible assets of $188.0 million as of December 31, 2018. We annually evaluate the remaining useful life of the intangible asset being amortized to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Identifiable intangible assets are also subject to testing for recoverability whenever events or changes indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable.\nChanges in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in future periods. Additionally, disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods.\nDeferred Tax Assets. At December 31, 2018 our balance sheet included $15.5 million of deferred tax assets, which is net of a $59.9 million valuation allowance. We also had $6.8 million of deferred tax liabilities resulting in net deferred tax assets of $8.7 million, substantially all related to our domestic entities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\nThe realization of a majority of the Company's deferred tax assets is not subject to any expiration and is dependent upon the reversal of the underlying temporary differences. To the extent future taxable income projections are not achieved, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 includes information on deferred tax activity during the past two years.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance, using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks. In the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates, we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations related to facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date and estimate of fair value related to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement can be made, we will record an asset retirement obligation and such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded. In 2018, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations of $0.8 million principally related to the retirement of water containment systems and storage tank and railcar cleaning costs in the United States. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 includes information on expense recognized during the past two years.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25fe\n</td> <td> the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25fe\n</td> <td> the expected long-term return on plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nWe develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our pension plans and our other post-retirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates at December 31, 2018, we use our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical bond portfolio to match expected cash flows under our benefit plans. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included with the exception of those with a make-whole call\u201d feature. The actuary limited the selection to those bonds with a minimum of 100,000 outstanding issues. Outlier bonds whose yields exceeded two standard deviations from the yield curve derived from similar quality bonds were excluded.\nOf the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates by 0.25 percent for our pension plans and 0.25 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $4.4 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $0.3 million.\nThe asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 30 to 40 percent equity securities and 60 to 70 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors, including expected re-allocations of asset mix occurring within a reasonable period of time. Our asset rate of return assumption is 4.83 percent for 2018 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 4.83 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $0.4 million.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets.\nEnvironmental Liabilities. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including, among other things, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, the discharge of effluent into waterways, the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters. We expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations. We may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third-party claims, or otherwise incur costs, relating to cleanup of, or for injuries resulting from, contamination at sites associated with past and present operations. We accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 includes information about environmental liabilities.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nWe are a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood preservation chemicals, and carbon compounds. Our products and services are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end-markets, including the railroad, specialty chemical, utility, residential lumber, agriculture, aluminum, steel, rubber, and construction industries. We serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network, with manufacturing facilities located in North America, South America, Australasia, China and Europe.\nWe operate three principal businesses: Railroad and Utility Products and Services ( RUPS\u201d), Performance Chemicals ( PC\u201d) and Carbon Materials and Chemicals ( CMC\u201d).\nThrough our RUPS business, we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the North American railroads. Our other treated wood products include utility poles for the electric and telephone utility industries in the United States and Australia. We also provide rail joint bar products as well as various services to the railroad industry. In April 2018, we re-entered the North American utility pole market with the acquisition of Cox Industries, Inc., which has been renamed Koppers Utility and Industrial Products Inc. ( UIP\u201d). UIP manufactures and sells utility poles and construction and marine pilings through a network of eight manufacturing facilities and 19 distribution yards located throughout the United States. In February 2018, Koppers Inc. acquired M.A. Energy Resources, LLC, a business related to the recovery of used crossties, which was renamed Koppers Recovery Resources LLC ( KRR\u201d) subsequent to the acquisition.\nThrough our PC business, we believe that we are the global leader in developing, manufacturing and marketing wood preservation chemicals and wood treatment technologies for use in the pressure treating of lumber for residential, industrial and agricultural applications. Our CMC business processes coal tar into a variety of products, including creosote, carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock, naphthalene and phthalic anhydride, which are intermediate materials necessary in the pressure treatment of wood, the production of aluminum, the production of carbon black, the production of high-strength concrete, and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals, respectively.\nOutlook\nTrend Overview\nOur businesses and results of operations are affected by various competitive and other factors including (i) the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products, including the impact of imported products from competitors in certain regions where we operate; (ii) raw material pricing and availability, in particular the cost and availability of hardwood lumber for railroad crossties and softwood lumber for utility poles, scrap copper prices, and the cost and amount of coal tar available in global markets, which is negatively affected by reductions in blast furnace steel production; (iii) volatility in oil prices, which impacts the cost of coal tar and certain other raw materials, as well as selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock, phthalic anhydride, and naphthalene; (iv) competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets; and (v) changes in foreign exchange rates.\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services\nWe provide our customers with treated and untreated wood products, rail joint bars and services primarily for the railroad markets in the United States and Canada. In addition, we supply treated utility poles for the utility sector in the United States and Australia. The primary end-markets for RUPS is the North American railroad industry, which has an installed base of approximately 700 million wood crossties, and the investor-owned utility industry which utilizes wooden distribution and transmission poles. Both crossties and utility poles require periodic replacement. Historically, North American demand for crossties had been in the range of 22-25 million annually. However, the crosstie replacement market has been significantly lower in recent years. According to the Railway Tie Association ( RTA\u201d), Class I railroads estimated crosstie installations of approximately 16 million in 2018 followed by a similar amount in 2019. For distribution poles, the demand has historically been in the range of two to three million annually. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services primarily for railroad bridges in the U.S. and Canada.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nThe supply of untreated crossties can vary at times based upon weather conditions in addition to other factors. We have a nationwide wood procurement team that maintains close working relationships with a network of sawmills. We procure untreated crossties, either on behalf of our customers, or for future treating. We also procure switch ties and various other types of lumber used for railroad bridges and crossings. Untreated crossties go through a six- to nine-month air seasoning process before they are ready to be pressure treated. After the air seasoning process is complete, the crossties are pressure treated using creosote-only treatment or a combined creosote and borate treatment. During any given year, there is a seasonal effect in the winter months on our crosstie business depending on weather conditions for harvesting lumber and installation.\nIn 2018, the major companies in the rail industry again substantially reduced both operating and capital spending from peak spending levels, which had a negative impact on sales of various products and services that we provide to that industry. Current year revenues and profitability reflected a decline year-over-year due to the effects of lower demand caused by continued reductions in capital budgets for most North American Class I railroads. We currently supply all seven of the North American Class I railroads and have long-standing relationships with these customers. Approximately 70 percent of our North American sales are under long-term contracts and we believe that we are positioned to maintain or grow our current market position.\nAccording to the Association of American Railroads, the level of business activity for the railroad industry is dependent on, to a large extent, trends occurring in other sectors of the economy. In the recent past, the Class I railroads were highly dependent on the oil and gas and coal mining industries. Currently, the railroads are more correlated to trade relations, commodity prices and interest rates. Rail traffic has continued to be relatively positive, with intermodal especially strong due to its close relation to consumer spending. However, there has been weakness in some commodity categories. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total U.S. carload traffic was up 1.8 percent from last year while intermodal units were up 5.5 percent from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, combined U.S. traffic for carloads and intermodal units was 3.7 percent higher than prior year. Although year-over-year rail traffic has steadily increased during the past several years, the amount of heavy-haul loads such as coal and fracking sands have declined significantly from historical levels. As a result, this translates into lighter-weight loads having less wear on tracks and ties.\nOver an economic cycle, the long-term prognosis for the railroad industry and the products and services that we provide to it are generally favorable. However, in the near-term, railroad customers have scaled back and are focusing on reducing their operating costs and working capital. As a result, the demand for treated crossties for 2018 has been relatively flat to lower than the prior year. In 2019, we expect demand to stabilize and modestly improve in the second half of the year, contingent on the availability of lumber for untreated crosstie production.\nIn terms of raw material, there was less available inventory of untreated crossties from the saw mills during 2018 and lumber prices increased dramatically due to a wet spring and summer affecting production. Currently, the RTA reports that the hardwood lumber demand has been softening with sharp declines in hardwood lumber sales volumes due to changing economic conditions in China. In addition, the potential effects from impending tariffs on trade between China and the U.S. may negatively impact the hardwood industry and the availability of lumber. For much of 2018, we experienced a tightness in the supply of untreated crosstie supply which challenged our ability to procure needed inventory. However, that seems to be alleviated somewhat as demand from China has softened. In the early part of 2019, many saw mills are again experiencing challenges related to unfavorable weather conditions hampering the procurement of untreated crossties. To the extent that we can build our untreated tie inventory, we anticipate having higher levels of dry crosstie inventory ready for treatment.\nIn addition, over the last several years, certain Class I railroads have shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. Going forward, we estimate that the remaining potential impact of this transition could be a further increase of working capital by approximately $50 million primarily due to higher inventory, and the associated revenue cycle could be temporarily extended for approximately six to nine months, for approximately $50 million in total. The actual timing of this impact will be dependent on the date, if at all, the remaining customer makes the transition.\nFrom a long-term perspective, there remains a need for sustained investment in infrastructure and capacity expansion. We believe that with our vertical integration capabilities in wood treatment and strong customer relationships, we will ultimately benefit from increased demand.\nPerformance Chemicals\nThe largest geographic market for wood treating chemicals sold by our PC business is in North America, and the largest application for our products is the residential remodeling market. We also have a market presence in Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. We believe that PC is the largest global manufacturer and supplier of water-based wood preservatives and wood specialty additives to treaters who supply pressure treated wood products to large\nretailers and independent lumber dealers. These retailers and dealers, in turn, serve the residential, agricultural and industrial pressure-treated wood market. Our primary products are copper-based wood preservatives, including micronized copper azole ( MicroPro\u00ae\u201d) and micronized pigments ( MicroShades\u00ae\u201d).\nIn North America, we are vertically integrated due to our manufacturing capabilities for copper compounds for our copper-based wood preservatives. We believe our vertical integration is part of our proprietary processes and reflects an important competitive advantage. Applications for these products include decking, fencing, utility poles, construction lumber and other outdoor structures.\nAs most of the products sold by PC are copper-based products, changes in the price and availability of copper can have a significant impact on product pricing and margins. We attempt to moderate the variability in copper pricing over time by entering into hedging transactions for the majority of our copper needs, which primarily range from six months up to 36 months. These hedges typically match expected customer purchases and receive hedge accounting treatment. From time to time, we enter into forward transactions based upon long-term forecasted needs of copper. These forward positions are typically marked to market on a quarterly basis.\nProduct demand for our PC business has historically been closely associated with consumer spending on home repair and remodeling projects, and therefore, trends in existing home sales serve as a leading indicator. Overall, the market for existing homes continues to show mixed signals. According to the National Association of Realtors\u00ae ( NAR\u201d), existing home sales declined in December after two consecutive months of increases. None of the four major U.S. regions saw a gain in sales activity in the month. The NAR reported that total existing-home sales decreased 6.4 percent from November and was down 10.3 percent from a year ago.\nAccording to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d) reported by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the annual growth in the national market for home improvement and repair has been revised lower and is now expected to grow 5.1 percent compared to 7.5 percent previously. Even so, LIRA projects that spending on these areas is still anticipated to expand to more than $350 billion nationally.\nThe Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index\u00ae decreased in December to 128.1, down from 136.4 in November. Consumers' assessment of current conditions has declined, which is attributed to an increasing concern that the pace of economic growth will begin moderating in the first half of 2019.\nFrom a margin perspective, our profitability has been unfavorably impacted by rising raw material costs, primarily due to copper prices which began to trend higher in 2017 and continuing into 2018 but has pulled back from highs reached in the first half of 2018. Our strategy is to hedge a majority of our requirements over a two-to-three year time frame in order to provide short-term certainty and visibility of our cost structure by lessening the impact that may arise in commodity markets. In a rising copper price environment such as in the past eighteen months, our average hedged prices have increased from prior year and we expect that to continue in 2019. We have begun hedging for our input needs in 2020 and as long as copper prices remain at current levels, we anticipate a year-over-year benefit for that time period. We have implemented pricing actions, where possible, to partially offset the impact of higher input costs.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals\nThe primary products produced by CMC are creosote, which is a registered pesticide in the U.S. and used primarily in the pressure treatment of railroad crossties, and carbon pitch, which is sold primarily to the aluminum industry for the production of carbon anodes used in the smelting of aluminum. We have reduced capacity in our CMC plants in North America and Europe over the past several years to levels required to meet creosote demand in North America for the treatment of railroad crossties. We currently supply our North American RUPS business with 100 percent of its creosote requirements. As discussed in the RUPS outlook, there has been a decrease starting in 2017 with respect to spending for railroad infrastructure. This results in a shift in excess distillate production to the commodity carbon black feedstock market until demand stabilizes for creosote and eventually returns to higher levels.\nWhile the sale of carbon pitch remains a significant portion of our sales volume, the reduction of aluminum smelting capacity in the United States, Australia and Western Europe has led to sharply lower demand for carbon pitch over the past several years. Accordingly, we have experienced significantly lower sales volumes due to the reduction in aluminum production in parts of the world where the majority of our production facilities are located. However, beginning in 2018, aluminum production in the U.S. increased to some extent as tariffs are being imposed on certain imported steel and aluminum products that has stimulated restarts of previously idled capacity. This development has resulted in additional demand for carbon pitch in the United States that can likely only be sustained through a continuation of current trade policy.\nThe availability of coal tar, the primary raw material for our CMC business, is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production. As the global steel industry, excluding Asia, has reduced the production of steel using metallurgical coke, the volumes of coal tar have also been reduced. For the past decade, the coal tar distillation industry has operated in an excess capacity mode, which further increased the competition for a limited amount of coal tar in North America. Over the\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\npast three years we have consolidated our operating footprint and significantly lowered production levels at the same time that we added distribution assets to move finished products from Europe to the U.S. more efficiently. As a result, our raw material needs in North America have been significantly less than historically required. In early 2017, we entered into several new long-term supply agreements to further lower our exposure to coal tar availability risk and volatile end markets.\nIn recent quarters, there has been an overall tightening market supply of coal tar and carbon pitch in China and it has put upward pressure on both raw materials and finished product pricing. This is due to an ongoing shutdown of older steel and coking capacity that does not meet environmental and emissions requirements. In turn, the shutdowns have resulted in increased demand for products requiring coal tar pitch, including needle coke used for producing electrodes that go into electric arc steel production, which is the primary market that we serve in China. As a result, our coal-tar distillation facility constructed in 2015 serving those markets has a competitive advantage. During 2018, pricing for coal tar products in the region moderated but remains relatively strong compared to prior year. For the external markets served by our CMC business, we anticipate that while Europe, North America and Australia will benefit from favorable demand levels, the margin will be negatively impacted by higher cost of raw materials in 2019.\nWith respect to our largest customer in China, we believe that the pricing we have received has been understated for a number of quarterly periods. While we continue to engage in discussions with this customer and hope to resolve the disagreement in accordance with certain provisions in our contractual relationship, we have not recognized any incremental revenue associated with the higher price that we believe is accurate. Therefore, our sales and margin in China were negatively impacted in 2018 due to lower volume requirements from this customer.\nGoing forward, the stronger demand has had a positive effect on pricing for the key raw material that we provide to this industry.\nCMC Restructuring Initiatives\nWe embarked on a plan to restructure our CMC operating footprint that reduced our global number of coal tar distillation facilities from the eleven that existed as of January 1, 2014 to four in total. The remaining facilities are located in regions where we believe we hold key competitive advantages that allow us to better serve our global customers: Stickney, Illinois; Nyborg, Denmark; Mayfield, Australia; and Jiangsu Province, China.\nAs a result of the reduction in operating capacity at the seven closed or sold coal tar distillation facilities, we have incurred substantial restructuring and impairment costs over the last four years. As a result of these initiatives, we expect additional restructuring and related charges to earnings of $5.0 million to $7.0 million through 2020. The overall expected future cash requirements for the CMC plant closures are estimated to be approximately $20 million through 2021. There may be additional curtailments or closures at our other CMC facilities as part of our efforts to reduce our cost structure and improve capacity utilization in our business. In October 2018, we completed the sale of our Clairton, Pennsylvania facility and, in doing so, transferred cash along with substantially all assets at the facility to the purchaser in exchange for the purchaser assuming certain historical and future obligations, including full responsibility for facility decommissioning, demolition and site restoration.\nThrough these restructuring initiatives, we are significantly transforming our CMC business model by streamlining the operating footprint and reducing our primary reliance on and exposure to the carbon pitch markets. In addition, the construction of a new naphthalene unit at our Stickney, Illinois, facility, which we completed commissioning in the third quarter of 2018, is anticipated to result in additional production efficiencies and cost savings going forward. All intermediate feedstocks are now being processed in Stickney as the new unit is now fully online. We believe that the extensive and ongoing efforts to reduce our fixed cost structure will result in a sustainable improvement in earnings in addition to lower volatility in cash flow.\nSeasonality and Effects of Weather on Operations\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, including inclement weather conditions, which in the past have affected operating results. Operations at some of our facilities have at times been reduced during the winter months. Moreover, demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather. As a result of the foregoing, we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Historically, our operating results have been significantly lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 634.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 512.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 420.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 411.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 655.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,710.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,475.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRUPS net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $122.2 million or 24 percent compared to the prior year. The sales increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of UIP and KRR in the current year as well as volume increases in the commercial tie and rail joint markets in the current year. These increases were offset by lower treating volumes of Class I crossties. Sales of Class I crossties declined by $61.7 million. This was primarily due to decreased spending in the rail industry, particularly the Class I market as certain Class I railroads have shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. More recently, a lack of dry crosstie inventory has also contributed to reduced treating volumes.\nPC net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $8.8 million or two percent compared to the prior year. The slightly higher sales were due primarily to higher volumes in Australasia for light organic solvent preservatives as well as a favorable mix of pricing and demand in North America. During the year, price volatility in the lumber market limited customer inventory and reduced customer demand for copper-based wood preservatives.\nCMC net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $103.7 million or 19 percent compared to the prior year due mainly to higher sales prices for carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock and naphthalene partially offset by reduced volumes in North America and Europe. In Australia and Europe, higher sales prices for carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock were driven primarily by higher raw material cost and increases in global benchmark oil pricing.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 80 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 78 percent in the prior year. Higher gross margins for CMC were driven by higher sales prices for carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock and naphthalene. These were offset by lower gross margins for PC driven by higher raw material costs and lower gross margins for RUPS due to reduced sales volumes of crossties in the Class I market combined with reduced margins as a result of higher raw material supply costs.\nDepreciation and amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.0 million higher when compared to the prior year period due mainly to assets placed in service over the past year related to our new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois along with depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions in the current year period.\nLoss on sale of assets of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects sales of our coal tar distillation facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania and our specialty chemicals business in the United Kingdom within our CMC segment as well as a sale of assets in the United Kingdom within our PC segment.\nImpairment and restructuring charges were $12.2 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2018 due mainly to prior year charges for restructuring-related storage tank decommissioning costs and accelerated depreciation for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facilities in Clairton, Pennsylvania and Follansbee, West Virginia. Current year charges consist primarily of remaining restructuring-related costs and depreciation at our Follansbee, West Virginia facility.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $29.1 million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to $18.5 million of incremental costs within KRR and UIP, $6.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and $3.3 million from higher compensation expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.8 million higher than the prior year period primarily due to the higher average debt level to fund our acquisitions of UIP and KRR.\nLoss on pension settlement was $10.0 million in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 100 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $3.1 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $1.2 million related to this transaction.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed an irrevocable transaction with an insurance company to annuitize approximately $31 million of retiree pension obligations in its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for a selected\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\ngroup of retirees. The transaction was funded by transferring a similar amount of assets from the pension plan to the insurance company. Subsequent to this transfer, the insurance company has assumed all remaining pension obligations associated with these retirees. The Company recorded a pension settlement loss of $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13.3 million. In 2017, all of our senior notes due 2019 were repurchased at a premium to carrying value and accordingly, we realized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.0 million consisting of $7.3 million for bond premium and bond tender expenses and $2.7 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we repaid our term loan in full and entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility and recorded a loss of $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.0 million lower when compared to the prior year period.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act also requires an income inclusion of foreign corporations' global intangible low-taxed income or GILTI and also introduces a limitation on the amount of interest expense that is deductible.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an estimate of this one-time transition tax and recorded a charge to income tax expense of $13.1 million. As a result of the corporate rate reduction to 21 percent, the Company recorded a charge of $7.4 million to adjust the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the impact of the one-time transition tax and the adjustment to our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and recorded an additional $4.7 million of income tax expense.\nThe Company has included the impact of the GILTI inclusion and the limitation on deductible interest expense in its 2018 tax provision. Although the interest expense deduction that is disallowed in the current year can be carried forward to future years, the Company has concluded that, in the foreseeable future, it will not be able to benefit from the disallowed interest expense deduction. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded against this deferred tax asset. The Company has recorded income tax expense of $15.6 million for the impact of the GILTI inclusion and the limitation on deductible interest expense.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 47.4 percent. The effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to the impact of the Tax Act partially offset with the reversal of a valuation allowance for a subsidiary in China that will be able to realize its net operating losses.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.1 percent. The effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35.0 percent due to the impact of the Tax Act. This increase due to the Tax Act is partially offset by a significant amount of foreign pre-tax earnings that are taxed at income tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit as a percentage of net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRUPS operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $20.3 million or 77 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 0.9 percent from 5.1 percent. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by reduced treating volumes of crossties to Class I customers. Additionally, we have experienced margin pressure from higher costs of raw materials from saw mills due to increased demand. The segment was also negatively impacted by $6.0 million in the current year period due to inventory purchase price fair value adjustments from the UIP acquisition.\nPC operating profit decreased by $35.2 million or 49 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for PC decreased to 8.6 percent from 17.4 percent in the prior year. Higher raw material prices, selling, general and administrative expenses, and transportation costs along with short-term supply disruptions more than offset our slight increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the current year period was unfavorably impacted by a net amount of $16.0 million due to changes in unrealized gains and losses from our copper swap contracts as compared to the prior year period.\nCMC operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $42.7 million or 153 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for CMC increased to 10.8 percent from 5.1 percent in the prior year period. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively affected by higher sales prices for most products and regions within the segment, primarily attributed to carbon pitch, and a more streamlined and efficient cost structure. These positive results were partially offset by reduced margins in China due to the impact of a temporary plant curtailment of our largest customer, lower sales volumes in North America, Australasia and Europe and higher raw material costs in Australasia and Europe.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 512.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 411.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 393.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 436.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,475.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,416.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $73.9 million or 13 percent compared to the prior year. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes of crossties and railroad bridge services, partially offset by higher sales volumes of utility products. Sales of crossties and railroad bridge services declined by $72.3 million. The reduction in treated crossties and structure services is attributed to lower spending in the rail industry across both the Class I and commercial markets. In addition, commercial crosstie pricing has been reduced due to an over-supply of crossties in the commercial market. Sales of utility products increased by $4.0 million due to increased demand for structural timber in Australia.\nPerformance Chemicals net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $17.8 million or five percent compared to the prior year. The sales increase was due primarily to higher North American sales volumes for some copper-based wood preservatives and additives. Higher sales volumes were driven primarily by favorable market trends in the repair and remodeling markets and existing home sales as well as treated wood dealers stocking and selling treated wood with higher preservative retention levels. These gains were offset in part by higher customer development costs, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales, compared to the prior year.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $115.4 million or 26 percent compared to the prior year due mainly to higher sales prices for carbon black feedstock, carbon pitch and coal tar chemicals with higher sales volumes for carbon black feedstock and coal tar chemicals, partially offset by lower creosote volumes. Our strategy is to sell as much distillate production to the higher value wood preservative market, however there was a reduction in creosote volume driven by lower demand for treated crossties during 2017. The excess distillate was sold as carbon black feedstock. Sales of coal tar chemicals increased over the prior year period due to increases in sales volumes and pricing of phthalic anhydride and naphthalene. The increases, in part, were driven by the effect of higher orthoxylene prices, which favorably impact phthalic anhydride market prices. Higher sales prices for carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock in Australasia and Europe were driven primarily by reduced supply in those regions.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 78 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 80 percent in the prior year due mainly to higher gross margins for CMC driven by lower raw material and shipping costs and higher sales prices in certain regions. In addition, a sales mix shift for PC improved our results as higher gross margins were driven by increased sales volumes in higher margin product lines. This more than offset lower sales volumes and\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\ngross margins from RUPS due to reduced sales volumes of crossties and railroad services combined with reduced margins in the commercial crosstie market as a result of inventory over-supply.\nDepreciation and amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.1 million lower when compared to the prior year period due mainly to a reduction in assets, excluding assets under construction, related to our shutdown of distillation facilities in the United States and United Kingdom.\nGain on sale of assets of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected the sale of our CMC tar distillation properties and assets in the United Kingdom in July 2016.\nImpairment and restructuring charges were $3.9 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2017 due mainly to a prior year accrual for exited real estate lease obligations, net of estimated sublease revenue, at our closed coal tar distillation facility in Uithoorn, the Netherlands, as well as severance charges related to our closed coal tar distillation CMC facilities in the United Kingdom and impairment charges for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Current year charges consist of restructuring-related storage tank decommissioning costs and accelerated depreciation for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facilities in Clairton, Pennsylvania and Follansbee, West Virginia.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.9 million higher when compared to the prior year due mainly to increases in consulting costs and stock-based compensation expense offset by decreases in customer development costs.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.3 million lower when compared to the prior year as a result of reduced average debt levels and reduced interest rates related to our 2025 Notes and our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLoss on pension settlement for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million higher when compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 100 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $3.1 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $1.2 million related to this transaction.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed an irrevocable transaction with an insurance company to annuitize approximately $31 million of retiree pension obligations in its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for a selected group of retirees. The transaction was funded by transferring a similar amount of assets from the pension plan to the insurance company. Subsequent to this transfer, the insurance company has assumed all remaining pension obligations associated with these retirees. The Company recorded a pension settlement loss of $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 375 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $13.9 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13.3 million higher when compared to the prior year period. In the current year period, all of our senior notes due 2019 were repurchased at a premium to carrying value and accordingly, we realized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.0 million consisting of $7.3 million for bond premium and bond tender expenses and $2.7 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we repaid our term loan in full and entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility and recorded a loss of $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $17.6 million higher when compared to the prior year period. The increase in tax expense is primarily due to the Tax Act.\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws to deferred taxes are accounted for in the period of legislative enactment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As a result of the corporate rate reduction to 21 percent, the Company recorded a charge of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from reducing the value of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nThe Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 that have not previously been subject to federal tax. The Company recorded an estimate of this one-time transition tax and recorded a charge to income tax expense of $13.1 million.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.1 percent. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 without the effect of the Tax Act were 14.1 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to an increase in foreign pre-tax earnings that are taxed at more favorable rates. Additionally, in the prior period, we incurred losses in certain foreign subsidiaries that did not generate a tax benefit, which increased our effective tax rate for that prior period.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized by segment in the following table:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Railroad and Utility Products and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carbon Materials and Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $27.9 million or 52 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 5.1 percent from 9.2 percent. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by reduced sales volumes of crossties and railroad services combined with reduced margins in the commercial crosstie market as a result of inventory over-supply in the commercial market. The negative impact from these factors was slightly offset by favorable volumes and sales mix of rail joint products and utility products.\nPerformance Chemicals operating profit increased by $7.9 million or 12 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for PC increased to 17.4 percent from 16.1 percent in the prior year. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted due primarily to higher North American sales volumes for copper-based wood preservatives. Sales volumes have improved due to favorable market trends in the repair and remodeling markets and existing home sales. Higher sales volumes were also driven primarily by changes in treated wood product application standards in 2016 resulting in treated wood dealers stocking and selling more high retention ground contact treated wood, which moderated in 2017 as dealer inventory has been sufficiently restocked with higher retention treated wood. Although we hedge the majority of our copper purchases, higher copper prices partially offset our increases in sales and operating profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $50.6 million or 224 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for CMC increased to 5.1 percent from a loss of 5.2 percent in the prior year period. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected by lower raw material and shipping costs and higher sales prices in certain regions. In addition to this, in recent quarters there has been an overall tightened market supply of coal tar and carbon pitch in China. This is due to an ongoing shutdown of steel and coking capacity that does not meet environmental and emissions requirements. The pricing for coal tar products in the region has increased significantly and as a result, our recently constructed coal-tar distillation facility serving those markets has a competitive advantage. These positive impacts were partially offset by lower sales volumes in North America and certain costs incurred, such as asset retirement charges, as we continue to consolidate our North American footprint.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net decrease of $23.5 million in cash provided by operations was due primarily to higher working capital usage of $20.3 million compared to the prior year period principally as a result of an increase in inventory of $18.3 million as one of our Class I railroad customers within RUPS has shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. An additional increase in inventory from CMC is due to higher raw material prices.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $119.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease of $17.7 million in cash from operations was due primarily to higher working capital usage compared to the prior year period principally as a result of an increase in accounts receivable in the current year period due to an increase in sales.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used for investing activities of $319.9 million is primarily due to $264.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions as well as incremental current year capital expenditures to expand production capacity at PC in the United States and continued spending on the new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois. Both of these projects were substantially completed by the end of 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net cash used by investing activities of $2.8 million is primarily due to capital expenditures to expand production capacity at PC in the United States and continued spending on the new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois offset by cash proceeds of $9.5 million from the loan repayment by Tangshan Kailuan Koppers Carbon Chemical Company Limited ( TKK\u201d).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $282.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash provided by financing activities in the current period reflected net borrowings of $314.6 million to primarily fund acquisitions and capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock of $31.8 million. The cash provided by financing activities in the prior year period reflected net borrowings of revolving credit of $54.3 million and net repayments of long-term debt of $46.7 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.0 million from the issuance of new debt and repurchases of common stock of $5.2 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities in the current period reflected net borrowings of revolving credit of $54.3 million offset by net repayments of long-term debt of $46.7 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.0 million from the issuance of new debt and repurchases of common stock of $5.2 million. The cash used in financing activities in the prior year period reflected net repayments of revolving credit and long-term debt of $29.7 million and $31.7 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has a $600.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $100.0 million secured term loan (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of April 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is variable and is based on LIBOR.\nRestrictions on Dividends to Koppers Holdings\nKoppers Holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, including the payment of any declared dividend of Koppers Holdings. The Revolving Credit Facility prohibits Koppers Inc. from making dividend payments to Koppers Holdings unless (1) such dividend payments are permitted by the indenture governing Koppers Inc.'s $500 million Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d), (2) no event of default or potential default has occurred or is continuing under our Revolving Credit Facility, and (3) we are in pro forma compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant after giving effect to such dividend. The indenture governing the 2025 Notes restricts Koppers Inc.'s ability to finance our payment of dividends if (1) a default has occurred or would result from such financing, (2) Koppers Inc., or a restricted subsidiary of Koppers Inc. which is not a guarantor under the indenture, is not able to incur additional indebtedness (as defined in the indenture), and (3) the sum of all restricted payments (as defined in the indenture) have exceeded the permitted amount (which we refer to as the basket\u201d) at such point in time.\nThe basket is governed by a formula based on the sum of a beginning amount, plus or minus a percentage of Koppers Inc.'s consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture), plus the net proceeds of Koppers Inc.'s qualified stock issuance or conversions of debt to qualified stock, plus the net proceeds from the sale of or a reduction in an investment (as defined in the indenture) or the value of the assets of an unrestricted subsidiary which is designated a restricted subsidiary. At December 31, 2018, the basket totaled $130.2 million. Notwithstanding such restrictions, the indenture governing the 2025 Notes permits an additional aggregate amount of $0.30 per share each fiscal quarter to finance dividends on the capital stock of Koppers Holdings, whether or not there is any basket availability, provided that at the time of such payment, no default in the indenture has occurred or would result from financing the dividends.\nIn addition, certain required coverage ratios in Koppers Inc.'s Revolving Credit Facility may restrict the ability of Koppers Inc. to pay dividends. Koppers Holdings last declared a dividend in November 2014 and does not expect to declare any dividends for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Koppers Inc., Koppers Holdings and their material domestic subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants for Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries that limit capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, liens, dividends and investments or acquisitions. In addition, such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $179.0 million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments. As of December 31, 2018, $31.9 million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our estimated liquidity as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount available under revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 179.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total estimated liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 219.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Cash includes approximately $36.9 million held by foreign subsidiaries. \nOur estimated liquidity was $263.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nOur remaining need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service, purchase commitments and operating leases, as well as working capital, capital maintenance programs, liability transfers of closed facilities and the funding of plant consolidation and rationalizations. We may also use cash to pursue other potential strategic acquisitions or voluntary pension plan contributions. Capital expenditures in 2019, excluding acquisitions, if any, are expected to total approximately $30 million and are expected to be funded by cash from operations.\nSchedule of Certain Contractual Obligations\nThe following table details our projected payments for our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. The table is based upon available information and certain assumptions we believe to be reasonable.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Later years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 452.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,002.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 259.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 134.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal tax payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 247.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 256.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 887.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 281.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 439.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 743.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 823.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,288.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Consists primarily of the maturity of the Senior Notes due 2025 and Revolving Credit Facility that will mature in 2023. \n (2) Relates to the transition tax in accordance with the Tax Act. \n (3) Consists primarily of raw materials purchase contracts. These are typically not fixed price arrangements; the prices are based on the prevailing market prices. As a result, we generally expect to be able to hedge the purchases with sales at those future prices. \nPension and other employee benefit plan funding obligations (for defined benefit plans) are not included in the table above. We expect defined benefit plan contributions to total approximately $3.6 million in 2019. Estimated funding obligations are determined by asset performance, workforce and retiree demographics, tax and employment laws and other actuarial assumptions which may change the annual funding obligations in addition to decisions to fund in excess of statutorily required amounts. The funded status of our defined benefit plans is disclosed in Note 15 in our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was $7.0 million of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 10 in our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nSchedule of Certain Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following table details our projected payments for other significant commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018.

The fixed charge coverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 1.35. \n \u25fe The senior secured leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended, is not permitted to exceed 3.25. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 2.39. \n \u25fe The total leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended, is not permitted to exceed 5.50. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 4.73. \nWe are currently in compliance with all covenants governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Our continued ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, however, excluding possible acquisitions, we currently expect that our net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements over the next twelve months.\nOther Matters\nForeign Operations and Foreign Currency Transactions\nWe are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations due to our foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a decrease to comprehensive income of $25.6 million, an increase of $17.0 million and a decrease of $4.3 million, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency which is different from the currency used by the entity to prepare its financial statements. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were $0.6 million, $(2.3) million and $(1.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nInformation regarding recently issued accounting guidance is contained in Note 3 New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Our management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue upon the completion of performance obligations under contracts with our customers and when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. Substantially all of our contracts with our customers are ship and invoice arrangements where revenue is recognized when we complete our performance obligations and transfer control to the customer. We also have certain arrangements where revenue is recognized under the contract where control of the goods or services had been transferred to the customer prior to shipment. Revenue recognition generally occurs at the point of shipment; however in certain circumstances as shipping terms dictate, we transfer control and revenue is recognized at the point of destination. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.\nWe also recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer. Service revenue, consisting primarily of wood treating services, is recognized at the time the service is provided and the performance obligation is satisfied.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In making this assessment, management relies on various factors, including operating results, estimated future cash flows, and business plans. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Because management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated.\nGoodwill valuations are performed using projected operating results of the relevant reporting units. We have three reporting units for purposes of goodwill evaluation. These units consist of our PC operating segment, our Railroad Products and Services reporting unit and our Utility Products reporting unit. Railroad Products and Services and Utility Products are one level below our RUPS operating segment. The Railroad Products and Services reporting unit primarily serves the rail industry in the United States and the Utility Products reporting unit serves the utility industries in the United States and Australia.\nGoodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 is $296.5 million. We determined that no impairment of goodwill at any of our reporting units was required as of December 31, 2018.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Identifiable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We have identifiable intangible assets of $188.0 million as of December 31, 2018. We annually evaluate the remaining useful life of the intangible asset being amortized to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Identifiable intangible assets are also subject to testing for recoverability whenever events or changes indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable.\nChanges in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in future periods. Additionally, disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods.\nDeferred Tax Assets. At December 31, 2018 our balance sheet included $15.5 million of deferred tax assets, which is net of a $59.9 million valuation allowance. We also had $6.8 million of deferred tax liabilities resulting in net deferred tax assets of $8.7 million, substantially all related to our domestic entities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\nThe realization of a majority of the Company's deferred tax assets is not subject to any expiration and is dependent upon the reversal of the underlying temporary differences. To the extent future taxable income projections are not achieved, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 includes information on deferred tax activity during the past two years.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance, using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks. In the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates, we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations related to facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date and estimate of fair value related to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement can be made, we will record an asset retirement obligation and such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded. In 2018, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations of $0.8 million principally related to the retirement of water containment systems and storage tank and railcar cleaning costs in the United States. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 includes information on expense recognized during the past two years.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:\n \u25fe the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; \n \u25fe the expected long-term return on plan assets; \nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nWe develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our pension plans and our other post-retirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates at December 31, 2018, we use our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical bond portfolio to match expected cash flows under our benefit plans. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included with the exception of those with a make-whole call\u201d feature. The actuary limited the selection to those bonds with a minimum of 100,000 outstanding issues. Outlier bonds whose yields exceeded two standard deviations from the yield curve derived from similar quality bonds were excluded.\nOf the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates by 0.25 percent for our pension plans and 0.25 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $4.4 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $0.3 million.\nThe asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 30 to 40 percent equity securities and 60 to 70 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors, including expected re-allocations of asset mix occurring within a reasonable period of time. Our asset rate of return assumption is 4.83 percent for 2018 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 4.83 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $0.4 million.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets.\nEnvironmental Liabilities. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including, among other things, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, the discharge of effluent into waterways, the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters. We expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations. We may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third-party claims, or otherwise incur costs, relating to cleanup of, or for injuries resulting from, contamination at sites associated with past and present operations. We accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 includes information about environmental liabilities.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nWe are a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood preservation chemicals, and carbon compounds. Our products and services are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end-markets, including the railroad, specialty chemical, utility, residential lumber, agriculture, aluminum, steel, rubber, and construction industries. We serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network, with manufacturing facilities located in North America, South America, Australasia, China and Europe.\nWe operate three principal businesses: Railroad and Utility Products and Services ( RUPS\u201d), Performance Chemicals ( PC\u201d) and Carbon Materials and Chemicals ( CMC\u201d).\nThrough our RUPS business, we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the North American railroads. Our other treated wood products include utility poles for the electric and telephone utility industries in the United States and Australia. We also provide rail joint bar products as well as various services to the railroad industry. In April 2018, we re-entered the North American utility pole market with the acquisition of Cox Industries, Inc., which has been renamed Koppers Utility and Industrial Products Inc. ( UIP\u201d). UIP manufactures and sells utility poles and construction and marine pilings through a network of eight manufacturing facilities and 19 distribution yards located throughout the United States. In February 2018, Koppers Inc. acquired M.A. Energy Resources, LLC, a business related to the recovery of used crossties, which was renamed Koppers Recovery Resources LLC ( KRR\u201d) subsequent to the acquisition.\nThrough our PC business, we believe that we are the global leader in developing, manufacturing and marketing wood preservation chemicals and wood treatment technologies for use in the pressure treating of lumber for residential, industrial and agricultural applications. Our CMC business processes coal tar into a variety of products, including creosote, carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock, naphthalene and phthalic anhydride, which are intermediate materials necessary in the pressure treatment of wood, the production of aluminum, the production of carbon black, the production of high-strength concrete, and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals, respectively.\nOutlook\nTrend Overview\nOur businesses and results of operations are affected by various competitive and other factors including (i) the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products, including the impact of imported products from competitors in certain regions where we operate; (ii) raw material pricing and availability, in particular the cost and availability of hardwood lumber for railroad crossties and softwood lumber for utility poles, scrap copper prices, and the cost and amount of coal tar available in global markets, which is negatively affected by reductions in blast furnace steel production; (iii) volatility in oil prices, which impacts the cost of coal tar and certain other raw materials, as well as selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock, phthalic anhydride, and naphthalene; (iv) competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets; and (v) changes in foreign exchange rates.\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services\nWe provide our customers with treated and untreated wood products, rail joint bars and services primarily for the railroad markets in the United States and Canada. In addition, we supply treated utility poles for the utility sector in the United States and Australia. The primary end-markets for RUPS is the North American railroad industry, which has an installed base of approximately 700 million wood crossties, and the investor-owned utility industry which utilizes wooden distribution and transmission poles. Both crossties and utility poles require periodic replacement. Historically, North American demand for crossties had been in the range of 22-25 million annually. However, the crosstie replacement market has been significantly lower in recent years. According to the Railway Tie Association ( RTA\u201d), Class I railroads estimated crosstie installations of approximately 16 million in 2018 followed by a similar amount in 2019. For distribution poles, the demand has historically been in the range of two to three million annually. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services primarily for railroad bridges in the U.S. and Canada.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nThe supply of untreated crossties can vary at times based upon weather conditions in addition to other factors. We have a nationwide wood procurement team that maintains close working relationships with a network of sawmills. We procure untreated crossties, either on behalf of our customers, or for future treating. We also procure switch ties and various other types of lumber used for railroad bridges and crossings. Untreated crossties go through a six- to nine-month air seasoning process before they are ready to be pressure treated. After the air seasoning process is complete, the crossties are pressure treated using creosote-only treatment or a combined creosote and borate treatment. During any given year, there is a seasonal effect in the winter months on our crosstie business depending on weather conditions for harvesting lumber and installation.\nIn 2018, the major companies in the rail industry again substantially reduced both operating and capital spending from peak spending levels, which had a negative impact on sales of various products and services that we provide to that industry. Current year revenues and profitability reflected a decline year-over-year due to the effects of lower demand caused by continued reductions in capital budgets for most North American Class I railroads. We currently supply all seven of the North American Class I railroads and have long-standing relationships with these customers. Approximately 70 percent of our North American sales are under long-term contracts and we believe that we are positioned to maintain or grow our current market position.\nAccording to the Association of American Railroads, the level of business activity for the railroad industry is dependent on, to a large extent, trends occurring in other sectors of the economy. In the recent past, the Class I railroads were highly dependent on the oil and gas and coal mining industries. Currently, the railroads are more correlated to trade relations, commodity prices and interest rates. Rail traffic has continued to be relatively positive, with intermodal especially strong due to its close relation to consumer spending. However, there has been weakness in some commodity categories. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total U.S. carload traffic was up 1.8 percent from last year while intermodal units were up 5.5 percent from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, combined U.S. traffic for carloads and intermodal units was 3.7 percent higher than prior year. Although year-over-year rail traffic has steadily increased during the past several years, the amount of heavy-haul loads such as coal and fracking sands have declined significantly from historical levels. As a result, this translates into lighter-weight loads having less wear on tracks and ties.\nOver an economic cycle, the long-term prognosis for the railroad industry and the products and services that we provide to it are generally favorable. However, in the near-term, railroad customers have scaled back and are focusing on reducing their operating costs and working capital. As a result, the demand for treated crossties for 2018 has been relatively flat to lower than the prior year. In 2019, we expect demand to stabilize and modestly improve in the second half of the year, contingent on the availability of lumber for untreated crosstie production.\nIn terms of raw material, there was less available inventory of untreated crossties from the saw mills during 2018 and lumber prices increased dramatically due to a wet spring and summer affecting production. Currently, the RTA reports that the hardwood lumber demand has been softening with sharp declines in hardwood lumber sales volumes due to changing economic conditions in China. In addition, the potential effects from impending tariffs on trade between China and the U.S. may negatively impact the hardwood industry and the availability of lumber. For much of 2018, we experienced a tightness in the supply of untreated crosstie supply which challenged our ability to procure needed inventory. However, that seems to be alleviated somewhat as demand from China has softened. In the early part of 2019, many saw mills are again experiencing challenges related to unfavorable weather conditions hampering the procurement of untreated crossties. To the extent that we can build our untreated tie inventory, we anticipate having higher levels of dry crosstie inventory ready for treatment.\nIn addition, over the last several years, certain Class I railroads have shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. Going forward, we estimate that the remaining potential impact of this transition could be a further increase of working capital by approximately $50 million primarily due to higher inventory, and the associated revenue cycle could be temporarily extended for approximately six to nine months, for approximately $50 million in total. The actual timing of this impact will be dependent on the date, if at all, the remaining customer makes the transition.\nFrom a long-term perspective, there remains a need for sustained investment in infrastructure and capacity expansion. We believe that with our vertical integration capabilities in wood treatment and strong customer relationships, we will ultimately benefit from increased demand.\nPerformance Chemicals\nThe largest geographic market for wood treating chemicals sold by our PC business is in North America, and the largest application for our products is the residential remodeling market. We also have a market presence in Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. We believe that PC is the largest global manufacturer and supplier of water-based wood preservatives and wood specialty additives to treaters who supply pressure treated wood products to large\nretailers and independent lumber dealers. These retailers and dealers, in turn, serve the residential, agricultural and industrial pressure-treated wood market. Our primary products are copper-based wood preservatives, including micronized copper azole ( MicroPro\u00ae\u201d) and micronized pigments ( MicroShades\u00ae\u201d).\nIn North America, we are vertically integrated due to our manufacturing capabilities for copper compounds for our copper-based wood preservatives. We believe our vertical integration is part of our proprietary processes and reflects an important competitive advantage. Applications for these products include decking, fencing, utility poles, construction lumber and other outdoor structures.\nAs most of the products sold by PC are copper-based products, changes in the price and availability of copper can have a significant impact on product pricing and margins. We attempt to moderate the variability in copper pricing over time by entering into hedging transactions for the majority of our copper needs, which primarily range from six months up to 36 months. These hedges typically match expected customer purchases and receive hedge accounting treatment. From time to time, we enter into forward transactions based upon long-term forecasted needs of copper. These forward positions are typically marked to market on a quarterly basis.\nProduct demand for our PC business has historically been closely associated with consumer spending on home repair and remodeling projects, and therefore, trends in existing home sales serve as a leading indicator. Overall, the market for existing homes continues to show mixed signals. According to the National Association of Realtors\u00ae ( NAR\u201d), existing home sales declined in December after two consecutive months of increases. None of the four major U.S. regions saw a gain in sales activity in the month. The NAR reported that total existing-home sales decreased 6.4 percent from November and was down 10.3 percent from a year ago.\nAccording to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d) reported by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the annual growth in the national market for home improvement and repair has been revised lower and is now expected to grow 5.1 percent compared to 7.5 percent previously. Even so, LIRA projects that spending on these areas is still anticipated to expand to more than $350 billion nationally.\nThe Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index\u00ae decreased in December to 128.1, down from 136.4 in November. Consumers' assessment of current conditions has declined, which is attributed to an increasing concern that the pace of economic growth will begin moderating in the first half of 2019.\nFrom a margin perspective, our profitability has been unfavorably impacted by rising raw material costs, primarily due to copper prices which began to trend higher in 2017 and continuing into 2018 but has pulled back from highs reached in the first half of 2018. Our strategy is to hedge a majority of our requirements over a two-to-three year time frame in order to provide short-term certainty and visibility of our cost structure by lessening the impact that may arise in commodity markets. In a rising copper price environment such as in the past eighteen months, our average hedged prices have increased from prior year and we expect that to continue in 2019. We have begun hedging for our input needs in 2020 and as long as copper prices remain at current levels, we anticipate a year-over-year benefit for that time period. We have implemented pricing actions, where possible, to partially offset the impact of higher input costs.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals\nThe primary products produced by CMC are creosote, which is a registered pesticide in the U.S. and used primarily in the pressure treatment of railroad crossties, and carbon pitch, which is sold primarily to the aluminum industry for the production of carbon anodes used in the smelting of aluminum. We have reduced capacity in our CMC plants in North America and Europe over the past several years to levels required to meet creosote demand in North America for the treatment of railroad crossties. We currently supply our North American RUPS business with 100 percent of its creosote requirements. As discussed in the RUPS outlook, there has been a decrease starting in 2017 with respect to spending for railroad infrastructure. This results in a shift in excess distillate production to the commodity carbon black feedstock market until demand stabilizes for creosote and eventually returns to higher levels.\nWhile the sale of carbon pitch remains a significant portion of our sales volume, the reduction of aluminum smelting capacity in the United States, Australia and Western Europe has led to sharply lower demand for carbon pitch over the past several years. Accordingly, we have experienced significantly lower sales volumes due to the reduction in aluminum production in parts of the world where the majority of our production facilities are located. However, beginning in 2018, aluminum production in the U.S. increased to some extent as tariffs are being imposed on certain imported steel and aluminum products that has stimulated restarts of previously idled capacity. This development has resulted in additional demand for carbon pitch in the United States that can likely only be sustained through a continuation of current trade policy.\nThe availability of coal tar, the primary raw material for our CMC business, is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production. As the global steel industry, excluding Asia, has reduced the production of steel using metallurgical coke, the volumes of coal tar have also been reduced. For the past decade, the coal tar distillation industry has operated in an excess capacity mode, which further increased the competition for a limited amount of coal tar in North America. Over the\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\npast three years we have consolidated our operating footprint and significantly lowered production levels at the same time that we added distribution assets to move finished products from Europe to the U.S. more efficiently. As a result, our raw material needs in North America have been significantly less than historically required. In early 2017, we entered into several new long-term supply agreements to further lower our exposure to coal tar availability risk and volatile end markets.\nIn recent quarters, there has been an overall tightening market supply of coal tar and carbon pitch in China and it has put upward pressure on both raw materials and finished product pricing. This is due to an ongoing shutdown of older steel and coking capacity that does not meet environmental and emissions requirements. In turn, the shutdowns have resulted in increased demand for products requiring coal tar pitch, including needle coke used for producing electrodes that go into electric arc steel production, which is the primary market that we serve in China. As a result, our coal-tar distillation facility constructed in 2015 serving those markets has a competitive advantage. During 2018, pricing for coal tar products in the region moderated but remains relatively strong compared to prior year. For the external markets served by our CMC business, we anticipate that while Europe, North America and Australia will benefit from favorable demand levels, the margin will be negatively impacted by higher cost of raw materials in 2019.\nWith respect to our largest customer in China, we believe that the pricing we have received has been understated for a number of quarterly periods. While we continue to engage in discussions with this customer and hope to resolve the disagreement in accordance with certain provisions in our contractual relationship, we have not recognized any incremental revenue associated with the higher price that we believe is accurate. Therefore, our sales and margin in China were negatively impacted in 2018 due to lower volume requirements from this customer.\nGoing forward, the stronger demand has had a positive effect on pricing for the key raw material that we provide to this industry.\nCMC Restructuring Initiatives\nWe embarked on a plan to restructure our CMC operating footprint that reduced our global number of coal tar distillation facilities from the eleven that existed as of January 1, 2014 to four in total. The remaining facilities are located in regions where we believe we hold key competitive advantages that allow us to better serve our global customers: Stickney, Illinois; Nyborg, Denmark; Mayfield, Australia; and Jiangsu Province, China.\nAs a result of the reduction in operating capacity at the seven closed or sold coal tar distillation facilities, we have incurred substantial restructuring and impairment costs over the last four years. As a result of these initiatives, we expect additional restructuring and related charges to earnings of $5.0 million to $7.0 million through 2020. The overall expected future cash requirements for the CMC plant closures are estimated to be approximately $20 million through 2021. There may be additional curtailments or closures at our other CMC facilities as part of our efforts to reduce our cost structure and improve capacity utilization in our business. In October 2018, we completed the sale of our Clairton, Pennsylvania facility and, in doing so, transferred cash along with substantially all assets at the facility to the purchaser in exchange for the purchaser assuming certain historical and future obligations, including full responsibility for facility decommissioning, demolition and site restoration.\nThrough these restructuring initiatives, we are significantly transforming our CMC business model by streamlining the operating footprint and reducing our primary reliance on and exposure to the carbon pitch markets. In addition, the construction of a new naphthalene unit at our Stickney, Illinois, facility, which we completed commissioning in the third quarter of 2018, is anticipated to result in additional production efficiencies and cost savings going forward. All intermediate feedstocks are now being processed in Stickney as the new unit is now fully online. We believe that the extensive and ongoing efforts to reduce our fixed cost structure will result in a sustainable improvement in earnings in addition to lower volatility in cash flow.\nSeasonality and Effects of Weather on Operations\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, including inclement weather conditions, which in the past have affected operating results. Operations at some of our facilities have at times been reduced during the winter months. Moreover, demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather. As a result of the foregoing, we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Historically, our operating results have been significantly lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized by segment in the following table:\n\nRUPS net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $122.2 million or 24 percent compared to the prior year. The sales increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of UIP and KRR in the current year as well as volume increases in the commercial tie and rail joint markets in the current year. These increases were offset by lower treating volumes of Class I crossties. Sales of Class I crossties declined by $61.7 million. This was primarily due to decreased spending in the rail industry, particularly the Class I market as certain Class I railroads have shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. More recently, a lack of dry crosstie inventory has also contributed to reduced treating volumes.\nPC net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $8.8 million or two percent compared to the prior year. The slightly higher sales were due primarily to higher volumes in Australasia for light organic solvent preservatives as well as a favorable mix of pricing and demand in North America. During the year, price volatility in the lumber market limited customer inventory and reduced customer demand for copper-based wood preservatives.\nCMC net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $103.7 million or 19 percent compared to the prior year due mainly to higher sales prices for carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock and naphthalene partially offset by reduced volumes in North America and Europe. In Australia and Europe, higher sales prices for carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock were driven primarily by higher raw material cost and increases in global benchmark oil pricing.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 80 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 78 percent in the prior year. Higher gross margins for CMC were driven by higher sales prices for carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock and naphthalene. These were offset by lower gross margins for PC driven by higher raw material costs and lower gross margins for RUPS due to reduced sales volumes of crossties in the Class I market combined with reduced margins as a result of higher raw material supply costs.\nDepreciation and amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.0 million higher when compared to the prior year period due mainly to assets placed in service over the past year related to our new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois along with depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions in the current year period.\nLoss on sale of assets of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects sales of our coal tar distillation facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania and our specialty chemicals business in the United Kingdom within our CMC segment as well as a sale of assets in the United Kingdom within our PC segment.\nImpairment and restructuring charges were $12.2 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2018 due mainly to prior year charges for restructuring-related storage tank decommissioning costs and accelerated depreciation for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facilities in Clairton, Pennsylvania and Follansbee, West Virginia. Current year charges consist primarily of remaining restructuring-related costs and depreciation at our Follansbee, West Virginia facility.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $29.1 million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to $18.5 million of incremental costs within KRR and UIP, $6.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and $3.3 million from higher compensation expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.8 million higher than the prior year period primarily due to the higher average debt level to fund our acquisitions of UIP and KRR.\nLoss on pension settlement was $10.0 million in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 100 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $3.1 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $1.2 million related to this transaction.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed an irrevocable transaction with an insurance company to annuitize approximately $31 million of retiree pension obligations in its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for a selected\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\ngroup of retirees. The transaction was funded by transferring a similar amount of assets from the pension plan to the insurance company. Subsequent to this transfer, the insurance company has assumed all remaining pension obligations associated with these retirees. The Company recorded a pension settlement loss of $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13.3 million. In 2017, all of our senior notes due 2019 were repurchased at a premium to carrying value and accordingly, we realized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.0 million consisting of $7.3 million for bond premium and bond tender expenses and $2.7 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we repaid our term loan in full and entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility and recorded a loss of $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.0 million lower when compared to the prior year period.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act also requires an income inclusion of foreign corporations' global intangible low-taxed income or GILTI and also introduces a limitation on the amount of interest expense that is deductible.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an estimate of this one-time transition tax and recorded a charge to income tax expense of $13.1 million. As a result of the corporate rate reduction to 21 percent, the Company recorded a charge of $7.4 million to adjust the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the impact of the one-time transition tax and the adjustment to our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and recorded an additional $4.7 million of income tax expense.\nThe Company has included the impact of the GILTI inclusion and the limitation on deductible interest expense in its 2018 tax provision. Although the interest expense deduction that is disallowed in the current year can be carried forward to future years, the Company has concluded that, in the foreseeable future, it will not be able to benefit from the disallowed interest expense deduction. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded against this deferred tax asset. The Company has recorded income tax expense of $15.6 million for the impact of the GILTI inclusion and the limitation on deductible interest expense.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 47.4 percent. The effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to the impact of the Tax Act partially offset with the reversal of a valuation allowance for a subsidiary in China that will be able to realize its net operating losses.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.1 percent. The effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35.0 percent due to the impact of the Tax Act. This increase due to the Tax Act is partially offset by a significant amount of foreign pre-tax earnings that are taxed at income tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized by segment in the following table:\n\nRUPS operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $20.3 million or 77 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 0.9 percent from 5.1 percent. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by reduced treating volumes of crossties to Class I customers. Additionally, we have experienced margin pressure from higher costs of raw materials from saw mills due to increased demand. The segment was also negatively impacted by $6.0 million in the current year period due to inventory purchase price fair value adjustments from the UIP acquisition.\nPC operating profit decreased by $35.2 million or 49 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for PC decreased to 8.6 percent from 17.4 percent in the prior year. Higher raw material prices, selling, general and administrative expenses, and transportation costs along with short-term supply disruptions more than offset our slight increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the current year period was unfavorably impacted by a net amount of $16.0 million due to changes in unrealized gains and losses from our copper swap contracts as compared to the prior year period.\nCMC operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $42.7 million or 153 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for CMC increased to 10.8 percent from 5.1 percent in the prior year period. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively affected by higher sales prices for most products and regions within the segment, primarily attributed to carbon pitch, and a more streamlined and efficient cost structure. These positive results were partially offset by reduced margins in China due to the impact of a temporary plant curtailment of our largest customer, lower sales volumes in North America, Australasia and Europe and higher raw material costs in Australasia and Europe.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized by segment in the following table:\n\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $73.9 million or 13 percent compared to the prior year. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes of crossties and railroad bridge services, partially offset by higher sales volumes of utility products. Sales of crossties and railroad bridge services declined by $72.3 million. The reduction in treated crossties and structure services is attributed to lower spending in the rail industry across both the Class I and commercial markets. In addition, commercial crosstie pricing has been reduced due to an over-supply of crossties in the commercial market. Sales of utility products increased by $4.0 million due to increased demand for structural timber in Australia.\nPerformance Chemicals net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $17.8 million or five percent compared to the prior year. The sales increase was due primarily to higher North American sales volumes for some copper-based wood preservatives and additives. Higher sales volumes were driven primarily by favorable market trends in the repair and remodeling markets and existing home sales as well as treated wood dealers stocking and selling treated wood with higher preservative retention levels. These gains were offset in part by higher customer development costs, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales, compared to the prior year.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $115.4 million or 26 percent compared to the prior year due mainly to higher sales prices for carbon black feedstock, carbon pitch and coal tar chemicals with higher sales volumes for carbon black feedstock and coal tar chemicals, partially offset by lower creosote volumes. Our strategy is to sell as much distillate production to the higher value wood preservative market, however there was a reduction in creosote volume driven by lower demand for treated crossties during 2017. The excess distillate was sold as carbon black feedstock. Sales of coal tar chemicals increased over the prior year period due to increases in sales volumes and pricing of phthalic anhydride and naphthalene. The increases, in part, were driven by the effect of higher orthoxylene prices, which favorably impact phthalic anhydride market prices. Higher sales prices for carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock in Australasia and Europe were driven primarily by reduced supply in those regions.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 78 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 80 percent in the prior year due mainly to higher gross margins for CMC driven by lower raw material and shipping costs and higher sales prices in certain regions. In addition, a sales mix shift for PC improved our results as higher gross margins were driven by increased sales volumes in higher margin product lines. This more than offset lower sales volumes and\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\ngross margins from RUPS due to reduced sales volumes of crossties and railroad services combined with reduced margins in the commercial crosstie market as a result of inventory over-supply.\nDepreciation and amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.1 million lower when compared to the prior year period due mainly to a reduction in assets, excluding assets under construction, related to our shutdown of distillation facilities in the United States and United Kingdom.\nGain on sale of assets of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected the sale of our CMC tar distillation properties and assets in the United Kingdom in July 2016.\nImpairment and restructuring charges were $3.9 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2017 due mainly to a prior year accrual for exited real estate lease obligations, net of estimated sublease revenue, at our closed coal tar distillation facility in Uithoorn, the Netherlands, as well as severance charges related to our closed coal tar distillation CMC facilities in the United Kingdom and impairment charges for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Current year charges consist of restructuring-related storage tank decommissioning costs and accelerated depreciation for the remaining fixed assets at our coal tar distillation facilities in Clairton, Pennsylvania and Follansbee, West Virginia.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.9 million higher when compared to the prior year due mainly to increases in consulting costs and stock-based compensation expense offset by decreases in customer development costs.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.3 million lower when compared to the prior year as a result of reduced average debt levels and reduced interest rates related to our 2025 Notes and our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLoss on pension settlement for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million higher when compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 100 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $3.1 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $1.2 million related to this transaction.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed an irrevocable transaction with an insurance company to annuitize approximately $31 million of retiree pension obligations in its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for a selected group of retirees. The transaction was funded by transferring a similar amount of assets from the pension plan to the insurance company. Subsequent to this transfer, the insurance company has assumed all remaining pension obligations associated with these retirees. The Company recorded a pension settlement loss of $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company offered a cash lump sum or annuity buyout to its terminated deferred vested participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 375 participants elected either a lump sum payout or annuity from a third-party provider. The total dollar amount paid out of our defined benefit plan assets was $13.9 million and the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13.3 million higher when compared to the prior year period. In the current year period, all of our senior notes due 2019 were repurchased at a premium to carrying value and accordingly, we realized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.0 million consisting of $7.3 million for bond premium and bond tender expenses and $2.7 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we repaid our term loan in full and entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility and recorded a loss of $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $17.6 million higher when compared to the prior year period. The increase in tax expense is primarily due to the Tax Act.\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws to deferred taxes are accounted for in the period of legislative enactment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As a result of the corporate rate reduction to 21 percent, the Company recorded a charge of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from reducing the value of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nThe Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 that have not previously been subject to federal tax. The Company recorded an estimate of this one-time transition tax and recorded a charge to income tax expense of $13.1 million.\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.1 percent. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 without the effect of the Tax Act were 14.1 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to an increase in foreign pre-tax earnings that are taxed at more favorable rates. Additionally, in the prior period, we incurred losses in certain foreign subsidiaries that did not generate a tax benefit, which increased our effective tax rate for that prior period.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized by segment in the following table:\n\nRailroad and Utility Products and Services operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $27.9 million or 52 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 5.1 percent from 9.2 percent. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by reduced sales volumes of crossties and railroad services combined with reduced margins in the commercial crosstie market as a result of inventory over-supply in the commercial market. The negative impact from these factors was slightly offset by favorable volumes and sales mix of rail joint products and utility products.\nPerformance Chemicals operating profit increased by $7.9 million or 12 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for PC increased to 17.4 percent from 16.1 percent in the prior year. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted due primarily to higher North American sales volumes for copper-based wood preservatives. Sales volumes have improved due to favorable market trends in the repair and remodeling markets and existing home sales. Higher sales volumes were also driven primarily by changes in treated wood product application standards in 2016 resulting in treated wood dealers stocking and selling more high retention ground contact treated wood, which moderated in 2017 as dealer inventory has been sufficiently restocked with higher retention treated wood. Although we hedge the majority of our copper purchases, higher copper prices partially offset our increases in sales and operating profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCarbon Materials and Chemicals operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $50.6 million or 224 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales for CMC increased to 5.1 percent from a loss of 5.2 percent in the prior year period. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected by lower raw material and shipping costs and higher sales prices in certain regions. In addition to this, in recent quarters there has been an overall tightened market supply of coal tar and carbon pitch in China. This is due to an ongoing shutdown of steel and coking capacity that does not meet environmental and emissions requirements. The pricing for coal tar products in the region has increased significantly and as a result, our recently constructed coal-tar distillation facility serving those markets has a competitive advantage. These positive impacts were partially offset by lower sales volumes in North America and certain costs incurred, such as asset retirement charges, as we continue to consolidate our North American footprint.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net decrease of $23.5 million in cash provided by operations was due primarily to higher working capital usage of $20.3 million compared to the prior year period principally as a result of an increase in inventory of $18.3 million as one of our Class I railroad customers within RUPS has shifted from a treatment-service only model to having suppliers hold untreated inventory until the crossties have been treated. An additional increase in inventory from CMC is due to higher raw material prices.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $119.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease of $17.7 million in cash from operations was due primarily to higher working capital usage compared to the prior year period principally as a result of an increase in accounts receivable in the current year period due to an increase in sales.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used for investing activities of $319.9 million is primarily due to $264.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions as well as incremental current year capital expenditures to expand production capacity at PC in the United States and continued spending on the new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois. Both of these projects were substantially completed by the end of 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net cash used by investing activities of $2.8 million is primarily due to capital expenditures to expand production capacity at PC in the United States and continued spending on the new naphthalene unit construction at our CMC plant in Stickney, Illinois offset by cash proceeds of $9.5 million from the loan repayment by Tangshan Kailuan Koppers Carbon Chemical Company Limited ( TKK\u201d).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $282.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash provided by financing activities in the current period reflected net borrowings of $314.6 million to primarily fund acquisitions and capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock of $31.8 million. The cash provided by financing activities in the prior year period reflected net borrowings of revolving credit of $54.3 million and net repayments of long-term debt of $46.7 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.0 million from the issuance of new debt and repurchases of common stock of $5.2 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities in the current period reflected net borrowings of revolving credit of $54.3 million offset by net repayments of long-term debt of $46.7 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.0 million from the issuance of new debt and repurchases of common stock of $5.2 million. The cash used in financing activities in the prior year period reflected net repayments of revolving credit and long-term debt of $29.7 million and $31.7 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has a $600.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $100.0 million secured term loan (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of April 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is variable and is based on LIBOR.\nRestrictions on Dividends to Koppers Holdings\nKoppers Holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, including the payment of any declared dividend of Koppers Holdings. The Revolving Credit Facility prohibits Koppers Inc. from making dividend payments to Koppers Holdings unless (1) such dividend payments are permitted by the indenture governing Koppers Inc.'s $500 million Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d), (2) no event of default or potential default has occurred or is continuing under our Revolving Credit Facility, and (3) we are in pro forma compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant after giving effect to such dividend. The indenture governing the 2025 Notes restricts Koppers Inc.'s ability to finance our payment of dividends if (1) a default has occurred or would result from such financing, (2) Koppers Inc., or a restricted subsidiary of Koppers Inc. which is not a guarantor under the indenture, is not able to incur additional indebtedness (as defined in the indenture), and (3) the sum of all restricted payments (as defined in the indenture) have exceeded the permitted amount (which we refer to as the basket\u201d) at such point in time.\nThe basket is governed by a formula based on the sum of a beginning amount, plus or minus a percentage of Koppers Inc.'s consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture), plus the net proceeds of Koppers Inc.'s qualified stock issuance or conversions of debt to qualified stock, plus the net proceeds from the sale of or a reduction in an investment (as defined in the indenture) or the value of the assets of an unrestricted subsidiary which is designated a restricted subsidiary. At December 31, 2018, the basket totaled $130.2 million. Notwithstanding such restrictions, the indenture governing the 2025 Notes permits an additional aggregate amount of $0.30 per share each fiscal quarter to finance dividends on the capital stock of Koppers Holdings, whether or not there is any basket availability, provided that at the time of such payment, no default in the indenture has occurred or would result from financing the dividends.\nIn addition, certain required coverage ratios in Koppers Inc.'s Revolving Credit Facility may restrict the ability of Koppers Inc. to pay dividends. Koppers Holdings last declared a dividend in November 2014 and does not expect to declare any dividends for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Koppers Inc., Koppers Holdings and their material domestic subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants for Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries that limit capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, liens, dividends and investments or acquisitions. In addition, such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $179.0 million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments. As of December 31, 2018, $31.9 million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our estimated liquidity as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Cash includes approximately $36.9 million held by foreign subsidiaries. \nOur estimated liquidity was $263.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nOur remaining need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service, purchase commitments and operating leases, as well as working capital, capital maintenance programs, liability transfers of closed facilities and the funding of plant consolidation and rationalizations. We may also use cash to pursue other potential strategic acquisitions or voluntary pension plan contributions. Capital expenditures in 2019, excluding acquisitions, if any, are expected to total approximately $30 million and are expected to be funded by cash from operations.\nSchedule of Certain Contractual Obligations\nThe following table details our projected payments for our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. The table is based upon available information and certain assumptions we believe to be reasonable.\n\n (1) Consists primarily of the maturity of the Senior Notes due 2025 and Revolving Credit Facility that will mature in 2023. \n (2) Relates to the transition tax in accordance with the Tax Act. \n (3) Consists primarily of raw materials purchase contracts. These are typically not fixed price arrangements; the prices are based on the prevailing market prices. As a result, we generally expect to be able to hedge the purchases with sales at those future prices. \nPension and other employee benefit plan funding obligations (for defined benefit plans) are not included in the table above. We expect defined benefit plan contributions to total approximately $3.6 million in 2019. Estimated funding obligations are determined by asset performance, workforce and retiree demographics, tax and employment laws and other actuarial assumptions which may change the annual funding obligations in addition to decisions to fund in excess of statutorily required amounts. The funded status of our defined benefit plans is disclosed in Note 15 in our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was $7.0 million of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 10 in our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nSchedule of Certain Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following table details our projected payments for other significant commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018. The table is based upon available information and certain assumptions we believe to be reasonable.\n\nDebt Covenants at December 31, 2018\nThe covenants that affect availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and which may restrict the ability of Koppers Inc. to pay dividends include the following financial ratios:\n \u25fe The fixed charge coverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended, is not permitted to be less than 1.10. The fixed charge coverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 1.35. \n \u25fe The senior secured leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended, is not permitted to exceed 3.25. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 2.39. \n \u25fe The total leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended, is not permitted to exceed 5.50. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 4.73. \nWe are currently in compliance with all covenants governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Our continued ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, however, excluding possible acquisitions, we currently expect that our net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements over the next twelve months.\nOther Matters\nForeign Operations and Foreign Currency Transactions\nWe are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations due to our foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a decrease to comprehensive income of $25.6 million, an increase of $17.0 million and a decrease of $4.3 million, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency which is different from the currency used by the entity to prepare its financial statements. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were $0.6 million, $(2.3) million and $(1.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nInformation regarding recently issued accounting guidance is contained in Note 3 New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Our management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue upon the completion of performance obligations under contracts with our customers and when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. Substantially all of our contracts with our customers are ship and invoice arrangements where revenue is recognized when we complete our performance obligations and transfer control to the customer. We also have certain arrangements where revenue is recognized under the contract where control of the goods or services had been transferred to the customer prior to shipment. Revenue recognition generally occurs at the point of shipment; however in certain circumstances as shipping terms dictate, we transfer control and revenue is recognized at the point of destination. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.\nWe also recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer. Service revenue, consisting primarily of wood treating services, is recognized at the time the service is provided and the performance obligation is satisfied.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In making this assessment, management relies on various factors, including operating results, estimated future cash flows, and business plans. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Because management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated.\nGoodwill valuations are performed using projected operating results of the relevant reporting units. We have three reporting units for purposes of goodwill evaluation. These units consist of our PC operating segment, our Railroad Products and Services reporting unit and our Utility Products reporting unit. Railroad Products and Services and Utility Products are one level below our RUPS operating segment. The Railroad Products and Services reporting unit primarily serves the rail industry in the United States and the Utility Products reporting unit serves the utility industries in the United States and Australia.\nGoodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 is $296.5 million. We determined that no impairment of goodwill at any of our reporting units was required as of December 31, 2018.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Identifiable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We have identifiable intangible assets of $188.0 million as of December 31, 2018. We annually evaluate the remaining useful life of the intangible asset being amortized to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Identifiable intangible assets are also subject to testing for recoverability whenever events or changes indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable.\nChanges in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in future periods. Additionally, disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods.\nDeferred Tax Assets. At December 31, 2018 our balance sheet included $15.5 million of deferred tax assets, which is net of a $59.9 million valuation allowance. We also had $6.8 million of deferred tax liabilities resulting in net deferred tax assets of $8.7 million, substantially all related to our domestic entities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\nThe realization of a majority of the Company's deferred tax assets is not subject to any expiration and is dependent upon the reversal of the underlying temporary differences. To the extent future taxable income projections are not achieved, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 includes information on deferred tax activity during the past two years.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance, using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks. In the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates, we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations related to facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date and estimate of fair value related to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement can be made, we will record an asset retirement obligation and such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded. In 2018, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations of $0.8 million principally related to the retirement of water containment systems and storage tank and railcar cleaning costs in the United States. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 includes information on expense recognized during the past two years.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:\n \u25fe the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; \n \u25fe the expected long-term return on plan assets; \nKoppers Holdings Inc. 2018 Annual Report\nWe develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our pension plans and our other post-retirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates at December 31, 2018, we use our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical bond portfolio to match expected cash flows under our benefit plans. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included with the exception of those with a make-whole call\u201d feature. The actuary limited the selection to those bonds with a minimum of 100,000 outstanding issues. Outlier bonds whose yields exceeded two standard deviations from the yield curve derived from similar quality bonds were excluded.\nOf the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates by 0.25 percent for our pension plans and 0.25 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $4.4 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $0.3 million.\nThe asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 30 to 40 percent equity securities and 60 to 70 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors, including expected re-allocations of asset mix occurring within a reasonable period of time. Our asset rate of return assumption is 4.83 percent for 2018 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 4.83 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $0.4 million.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets.\nEnvironmental Liabilities. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including, among other things, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, the discharge of effluent into waterways, the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters. We expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations. We may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third-party claims, or otherwise incur costs, relating to cleanup of, or for injuries resulting from, contamination at sites associated with past and present operations. We accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable. Item 8.

report:\n\n- Koppers is a global provider of treated wood products, wood preservation chemicals, and carbon compounds. They operate three main businesses: Railroad and Utility Products and Services (RUPS), Performance Chemicals (PC), and Carbon Materials and Chemicals (CMC).\n\n- In 2018, RUPS sales increased due to acquisitions but profitability declined due to reduced demand and higher costs. PC sales rose slightly but profitability declined due to higher raw material costs. CMC sales and profitability increased due to higher sales prices and a more streamlined cost structure. \n\n- Net income was $46.7 million in 2018 compared to $62.5 million in 2017. The decline was primarily due to acquisition costs, higher interest expense, and the impact of tax reform in 2017.\n\n- Cash from operations was $78.3 million in 2018 versus $101.8 million in 2017. Higher working capital usage drove the decrease.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $376.4 million in 2018 compared to $56.5 million in 2017, mainly due to acquisitions and expansion projects. \n\n- At December 31, 2018, estimated liquidity was $219.6 million. Debt covenants were in compliance.\n\n- Key factors affecting future results include economic conditions, raw material availability and pricing, competitive pressures, foreign exchange rates, and execution of restructuring initiatives."}
