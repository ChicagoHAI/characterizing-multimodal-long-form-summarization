MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations - Overview\nQNB Corp. ( QNB\u201d or the Company\u201d) earns its net income primarily through its subsidiary, QNB Bank (the Bank\u201d). Net interest income, or the spread between the interest, dividends and fees earned on loans and investment securities and the expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, is the primary source of operating income for QNB. QNB seeks to achieve sustainable and consistent earnings growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk levels approved by the Board of Directors. Due to its limited geographic area, comprised principally of Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, growth is pursued through expansion of existing customer relationships and building new relationships by stressing a consistent high level of service at all points of contact.\nTabular information presented throughout management's discussion and analysis, other than share and per share data, is presented in thousands of dollars.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,335,000, or $3.25 per share on a diluted basis. This compares to 2017 net income of $8,289,000, or $2.41 per share on a diluted basis and 2016 net income of $8,924,000, or $2.63 per share on a diluted basis. Two important measures of profitability in the banking industry are an institution's return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity. Return on average assets was 0.96%, 0.74% and 0.87% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and return on average shareholders' equity was 10.47%, 8.17% and 9.45%, respectively, during those same periods.\n2018 versus 2017\nThe results for 2018 include the following significant components:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net interest income increased $2,593,000, or 8.0%, to $35,015,000 for 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased one basis points to 3.13% for 2018 from 3.14% for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Provision for loan losses totaled $1,130,000 for 2018, compared with $1,400,000 for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-interest income for 2018 was $4,892,000, a decrease of $1,995,000, or 29.0%, compared with 2017.

Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed). Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing deposits.\nFor purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the table that appears above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared.\nThe net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.\n2018 versus 2017\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2018 increased $1,829,000, or 5.4%, to $35,833,000. The net interest margin, which decreased slightly to 3.13% was unfavorably impacted by increased rates on deposits and borrowings and less favorable tax-equivalent yields on tax-exempt municipal investments and loans as the Federal tax rate decreased from 34% to 21%. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 18 basis points from 3.67% for 2017 to 3.85% for 2018 with the yield on loans increasing 16 basis points, favorably impacted by a $38,565,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and an 11 basis point increase in the related yield and a $26,117,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 46 basis point increase in the related yield, while the yield on investment securities declined slightly to 2.32%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points from 0.64% for 2017 to 0.88% for 2018 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.65% to 0.86% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $31,842,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.\nMarket disruption caused by local bank consolidation positively impacted both loan and deposit growth which was partially offset by the competitive local interest rate market for quality loans and deposits. Net interest spread decreased six basis points to 2.97% for 2018 compared to 3.03% for 2017. Average earning assets increased by $61,070,000, or 5.6%, to $1,143,506,000 for 2018, with average loans increasing $84,262,000, or 12.3%, to $766,744,000, while average investment securities decreased $17,699,000, or 4.5%, to $372,803,000. With the growth in earning assets occurring primarily in the loan portfolio, the mix of earning assets changed, which also contributed to relative stability of the net interest margin, as investment securities generally earn a lower yield than loans. The growth in earning assets was funded by a $40,656,000, or 4.2%, increase in average total deposits to $1,003,154,000, and the increase in average short-term borrowing, comprising sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings, of $12,267,000, or 25.2%.\n- 21 -\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law, reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This reduction in the tax rate had an impact on the tax-equivalent yield on certain interest-earning assets. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the 2017 interest margin of approximately seven basis points.\n2017 versus 2016\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2017 increased $3,859,000, or 12.8%, to $34,004,000. The net interest margin, which increased to 3.14% was favorably impacted by a $59,846,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and a 12-basis point increase in the related yield and a $17,451,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 38-basis point increase in the related yield. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 17 basis points from 3.50% for 2016 to 3.67% for 2017 with the yield on loans increasing 13 basis points while the yield on investment securities declined slightly to 2.39%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased seven basis points from 0.57% for 2016 to 0.64% for 2017 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.58% to 0.65% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $55,717,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.\n- 22 -\nAverage Balances, Rates, and Interest Income

Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased $4,334,000 to $44,018,000 for 2018, while total interest expense increased $2,505,000 to $8,185,000. Volume growth in earning assets contributed an additional $3,223,000 of interest income and interest rate increases contributed to additional interest income of $1,111,000. Rate-related interest expense increased $2,332,000, while volume-related interest expense increased $173,000.\nInvestments\n2018 versus 2017\nInterest income on available-for-sale and equity investment securities decreased $650,000 when comparing the two years. The decrease in average balances contributed to $400,000 of the decrease, while rates contributed the remaining $250,000 decrease. The average yield on the available-for-sale and equity investment portfolio declined slightly to 2.32% for 2018 compared to 2.38% for 2017. The decrease in the investment portfolio is due to funding needs to support loan growth.\n- 24 -\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities decreased $24,000, due to a decrease in average balances totaling $1,888,000, which was partially offset by an increase in the yield on the portfolio of one basis points from 1.78% for 2017 to 1.79% for 2018. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2018 as a result of the rising rates during the year.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities decreased $631,000. The decline in yield of 62 basis points from 3.91% in 2017 to 3.29% in 2018 contributed to a $441,000 reduction in interest income. Average balances, which decreased $4,858,000, contributed $190,000 to the interest income decline. QNB had purchased many municipal securities when rates were significantly higher. Many of these bonds have either reached maturity or their call dates and are being replaced with municipal bonds with lower yields. Typically, QNB purchased municipal bonds with 10- to 15-year maturities with call dates between 2 and 5 years. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the yield on municipal bonds of approximately 65 basis points to 3.26%. Future demand for tax-exempt municipal securities is uncertain, as the tax-equivalent yield is less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics. This portfolio is expected to continue to decline as there are $21,857,000 in municipal bonds with a 2018 tax-equivalent yield of 3.51% that are expected to be called or mature in 2019. The current yield on replacement bonds is below this threshold.\nAll the mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMO\u201d) securities owned by QNB are issued by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises ( GSE\u201d) and carry the implicit backing of the U.S. Government, but they are not direct obligations of the U.S. Government. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased $18,000 primarily due to a decrease of $10,359,000, or 4.6%, in average balances. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by nine basis points from 2.05% for 2017 to 2.14% for 2018. This portfolio generally provides higher yields relative to agency bonds and provides monthly cash flow which can be used for liquidity purposes or can be reinvested as interest rates increase.\n2017 versus 2016\nInterest income on trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity investment securities increased $691,000 when comparing the two years. The increase in average balances contributed to $613,000 of the increase, while better rates contributed the remaining $78,000 increase. The average yield on the investment portfolio declined slightly to 2.39% for 2017 compared to 2.42% for 2016. The increase in the investment portfolio is due to investment opportunities at a yield comparable to the overall portfolio yield in late 2016 compared with previous periods, as well as continuing increase in deposits.\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities increased $193,000, due to an increase in average balances totaling $12,767,000, which was offset by a decline in the yield on the portfolio of five basis points from 1.83% for 2016 to 1.78% for 2017. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2017 as a result of the rising rates during the year.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities increased $12,000. Average balances, which increased $2,785,000, contributed $113,000 to interest income. This was partially offset by a 13-basis point decline in yield from 4.04% in 2016 to 3.91% in 2017 contributing to a $101,000 reduction in interest income.\nInterest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs increased $578,000 primarily due to an increase of $21,436,000, or 10.6%, in average balances. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by seven basis points from 1.98% for 2016 to 2.05% for 2017.\nLoans\n2018 versus 2017\nThe largest category of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans. This category of loans includes commercial purpose loans secured by either commercial properties such as office buildings, hotels, factories, warehouses, medical facilities and retail establishments, or residential real estate, usually the residence of the business owner or investment properties. The category also includes construction and land development loans. Income on commercial real estate loans increased $2,226,000. The increase in average balances of $38,565,000, or 9.8%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,755,000. The 11-basis point increase in yield, from 4.55% in 2017 to 4.66% in 2018 resulted in an increase of interest income of $471,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans, the second largest category, increased $1,917,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $26,117,000, or 20.3%, to $154,958,000 for 2018, resulting in a $1,214,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 46 basis points to 5.10% providing an additional $703,000 in interest income. Many of the loans in this category are indexed to the prime interest rate, which increased by one quarter of one percent four times since December 2017.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $26,000 from 2017. When comparing the same periods, average balances increased $7,270,000 to $43,012,000, which contributed a $287,000 increase in interest income. This increase was offset by a decrease in the average yield on\n- 25 -\nthe tax-exempt loan portfolio from 3.95% for 2017 to 3.22% for 2018, resulting in a decline in interest income of $313,000. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the yield on municipal bonds of approximately 66 basis points to 3.29%.\nQNB strives to become the local consumer lender of choice\u201d, and to affect this goal, QNB has refocused its retail lending efforts by strengthening the management of the area, adding new product offerings and by increasing marketing and promotion. The positive impact of this renewed focus has been year-over-year growth in balances in all three categories of retail lending: residential mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. Overall, interest income for retail lending increased $893,000 in 2018 compared with 2017, driven by the increase in average balances and average rate increases on home equity and consumer loans. 2017 tax reform legislation changed the tax deductibility of home equity interest for borrowers.\nIncome on home equity loans increased by $422,000 when comparing 2018 and 2017. During 2018 and 2017, QNB offered attractive rates on both variable rate and fixed rate home equity loans, which contributed to an increase in average balances totaling $798,000, or 1.2%, to $67,3762,000 when comparing 2018 and 2017. The yield on the home equity portfolio increased 58 basis points to 4.44% when comparing the two years, primarily due to prime rate increases. The demand for home equity loans has improved along with the recovery in home values. We expect that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nGiven the low yields on alternative investment securities, QNB retained certain hybrid adjustable rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios. As a result, average residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $11,070,000, or 21.6%, to $62,312,000 for 2018. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio remained fairly level at 3.86% for 2018 compared to 3.89% for 2017. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $406,000 in 2018.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $65,000. As with all other categories of retail loans, consumer loans at QNB experienced growth in average balances in 2018, which increased $442,000, or 6.7%, led by student loan growth. Growth in volume contributed $23,000 to the increase in income, and the 60-basis point increase in the average yield from 5.39% in 2017 to 5.99% in 2018 contributed to an increase in interest income of $42,000.\n2017 versus 2016\nIncome on commercial real estate loans increased $3,142,000. The increase in average balances of $59,846,000, or 17.9%, contributed an increase in interest income of $2,650,000. The 12-basis point increase in yield, from 4.43% in 2016 to 4.55% in 2017 resulted in an increase of interest income of $492,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans increased $1,235,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $17,451,000, or 15.7%, to $128,841,000 for 2017, resulting in a $744,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 38 basis points to 4.64% providing an additional $491,000 in interest income.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $58,000 from 2016. When comparing the same periods, average balances decreased $2,896,000 to $35,742,000, which contributed a $111,000 decrease in interest income. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio from 3.80% for 2016 to 3.95% for 2017, resulting in additional interest income of $53,000.\nIndirect lease financing receivables represent loans to small businesses that are collateralized by equipment. In October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts. Interest income in 2016 included $702,000 from these contracts.\nInterest income for retail lending increased $577,000 in 2017 compared with 2016, driven by both the increase in average balances and rising rates in 2017.\nAverage residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $6,009,000, or 13.3%, to $51,242,000 for 2017. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio remained level at 3.89% for 2017 and 2016. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $237,000 in 2017.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $110,000. Average balances in this segment increased $1,663,000. This growth in volume contributed $98,000 to the increase in income, and the 19-basis point increase in the average yield from 5.20% in 2016 to 5.39% in 2017 contributed to an increase in interest income of $12,000.\n- 26 -\nDeposits and Borrowings\n2018 versus 2017\nEarning assets are funded primarily by deposits, which increased on average by $40,656,000, or 4.2%, to $1,003,154,000, when comparing 2018 and 2017. Total interest expense for 2018 was $8,185,000 compared with $5,680,000 for 2017, an increase of $2,505,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $2,086,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $419,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 21 basis points; the rate paid on borrowings increased 58 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as the competition for deposits increases.\nConsistent with the past several years, the growth in deposits during 2018 was centered in accounts with greater liquidity. Average non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $8,814,000, or 7.2%, to $130,633,000 for 2018; QNB has been successful in increasing both personal and business checking accounts. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $24,432,000, or 14.4%, to $194,372,000 for 2018 compared with 2017, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $336,000 to $689,000 for 2018. The average rate paid increased 14 basis points to 0.35% for 2018 compared to 0.21% for 2017. Interest-bearing business checking account average balances increased by $14,265,000, or 72.8%, and related interest expense increased $276,000, or 77 basis points in yield, when comparing the two years. This was primarily due to one large commercial customer consolidating both existing and external accounts. Also included in this category is QNB-Rewards checking, a tiered-rate checking account product. In order to receive the high rate a customer must receive an electronic statement, have one direct deposit or other ACH transaction and have at least 12 check card purchase transactions post and clear per statement cycle. If these qualifications are not met, the rate paid for 2017 was 0.20% increasing during 2018 to 0.25%. For 2018, the average balance in this product was $54,188,000 and the related interest expense was $338,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.62%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2017 was $50,907,000, yielding 0.55%. The rates paid on the QNB-Rewards product, assuming qualifications are met, is attractive relative to competitors' offerings as well as other QNB products. This product also generates fee income through the use of the check card. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $99,451,000 for 2017 to $106,337,000 for 2018. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.05% for both years.\nAverage money market accounts decreased $6,490,000, or 7.7%, to $77,713,000 for 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to higher yielding certificates of deposits. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $80,000 to $329,000 for 2018 compared with 2017. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.42% for 2018, an increase of 12 basis points compared with 2017. The balances in this category primarily comprise Select money market accounts, a product that pays a tiered rate based on account balances. The balances remaining in these accounts for 2018 were primarily at higher-yielding tiers.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $753,000 to $1,537,000 for 2018. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $3,641,000, or 3.3%, to $106,411,000 while the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased 73 basis points to 1.44% for 2018 from 0.71% for 2017. Most of these accounts are indexed to the Federal funds rate with negotiated rate floors between 0.25% and 0.50%. Many of these deposits are seasonal in nature and are received during the third quarter as tax receipts are collected and are withdrawn over the course of the next year.\nQNB's online e-Savings product is the largest category of savings deposits and was created to compete with other online savings accounts. Average balances grew $13,395,000, or 7.4%, to $195,258,000 in 2018 compared with $181,863,000 in 2017. The rate on this product increased from 0.65% at the end of 2017 to 0.85% in December 2018. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.58% for 2017 and 0.79% for 2018. The yield on this account may rise along with market rates and as competition for savings balances increases. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $3,657,000, or 5.4%, to $71,688,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.62% for 2018, a 16-basis point increase from 2017 while interest expense increased $501,000, from $1,156,000 to $1,657,000 over the same period. The growth in balances appears to reflect the desire for liquidity and a better rate than short-term time deposits.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $416,000, to $3,301,000 in 2018, due to a 22-basis point increase in yield, from 1.27% in 2017 to 1.45% in 2018. The increase in average balances was $489,000 in 2018, to $227,079,000. Similar to fixed-rate loans and investment securities, time deposits reprice over time and, therefore, have less of an immediate impact on costs in either a rising or falling rate environment. However, the maturity and repricing characteristics of time deposits tend to be shorter.\nApproximately $78,931,000, or 35.3%, in time deposits will reprice or mature over the next 12 months compared with 42.7% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017. The average rate paid on these time deposits is approximately 1.06%. QNB has extended the maturity of the time deposit portfolio by offering attractive rates at terms greater than 12 months. Interest expense is expected to increase along with competition for deposits.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2018 of $38,172,000 and $22,767,000, respectively. Interest\n- 27 -\nexpense on short-term borrowings increased by $419,000 to $672,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances of borrowings from correspondent banks increased $13,396,000. The increase in these borrowings was the primary contributor to the increase in the average rate paid from 0.52% to 1.10%.\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal interest expense for 2017 was $5,680,000 compared with $4,733,000 for 2016, an increase of $947,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $848,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $99,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on both interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearings liabilities increased seven basis points; the rate paid on borrowings increased 14 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as short-term interest rates begin to rise and the competition for deposits increases.\nAverage non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $14,240,000, or 13.2%, to $121,819,000 for 2017. Business checking account average balances increased by $11,707,000, or 13.5%, when comparing the two years. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $16,342,000, or 10.6%, to $169,940,000 for 2017 compared with 2016, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $38,000 to $353,000 for 2017. The average rate paid remained unchanged at 0.21% for 2016 and 2017. The average balance in QNB-Rewards checking was $50,907,000 and the related interest expense was $281,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.55%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2016 was $44,918,000, yielding 0.56%. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $108,680,000 for 2016 to $119,033,000 for 2017. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.06% for both years. Average money market accounts increased $12,947,000, or 18.2%, to $84,203,000 for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to more liquid accounts. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $57,000 to $249,000 for 2017 compared with 2016. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.30% for 2017, an increase of three basis points compared with 2016.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $433,000 to $784,000 for 2017. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $7,992,000, or 7.8%, to $110,052,000 and the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased 37 basis points to 0.71% for 2017 from 0.34% for 2016.\nOnline eSavings account average balances grew $13,503,000, or 8.0%, to $181,863,000 in 2017 compared with $168,360,000 in 2016. The rate on this product was changed from 0.55% at the end of 2016 to 0.65% in late December 2017. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.50% for 2016 and 0.58% for 2017. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $6,612,000, or 10.8%, to $68,031,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.46% for 2017, a six-basis point increase from 2016 while interest expense increased $233,000, from $923,000 to $1,156,000 over the same period.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $87,000, to $2,885,000 in 2017, due to a four-basis point increase in yield, from 1.23% in 2016 to 1.27% in 2017. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average balances of $1,679,000 in 2017, to $226,590,000.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2017 of $39,301,000 and $9,371,000, respectively. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $99,000 to $253,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances increased $8,472,000 to $48,672,000, and the average rate paid increased 14 basis points, from 0.38% to 0.52%.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents management's determination of the amount necessary to be charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. QNB recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,130,000, $1,400,000 and $30,000 for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the $220,000 reversal in allowance for loan losses associated with the sale of the indirect lease finance portfolio, the 2016 provision would have been $250,000. Net loan charge-offs were $137,000, or 0.02% of total average loans for 2018 compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of total average loans in 2017 and $190,000, or 0.03%, in 2016. The majority of the loans charged off during 2018 and 2017 had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loans. Deterioration in credit quality or significant growth in the loan portfolio may result in a higher provision for loan losses in 2019.\n- 28 -\nNon-Interest Income\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>

fees and service charges. Total non-interest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and check card income, retail brokerage and advisory income, income on bank-owned life insurance, merchant income and gains and losses on investment securities and residential mortgage loans. Total non-interest income was $4,892,000 in 2018 compared with $6,887,000 in 2017, a decrease of $1,995,000.\nFees for services to customers are primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts. These fees were $1,699,000 for 2018, an increase of $31,000, or 1.9%, from 2017. Overdraft income, which represented approximately 78% and 76% of total fees for services to customers in 2018 and 2017, respectively, increased by $50,000, or 3.9%, when comparing 2018 to 2017. The increase in overdraft income primarily reflects an increase in the number of overdraft occurrences.\nATM and debit card income is primarily comprised of transaction income on debit cards and ATM cards and ATM surcharge income for the use of QNB's ATM machines by non-QNB customers. ATM and debit card income was $1,895,000 in 2018, an increase of $146,000, or 8.3%, from the amount recorded in 2017. Debit card interchange income increased $147,000, or 8.7%, to $1,841,000 in 2018, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $1,000 to $54,000. The growth in checking accounts and card usage contributed to the increase in debit card income, including the QNB Rewards checking product, a tiered-rate checking account which requires, among other terms, the posting of a minimum of twelve debit card purchase transactions per statement cycle to receive the high interest rate.\nQNB provides securities and advisory services under the name QNB Financial Services through an independent third-party registered Broker/Dealer and Registered Investment Advisor. QNB terminated its contract with its third-party broker-dealer effective August 1, 2018 and entered into a similar arrangement with another third-party provider. QNB Financial Services staff are in the process of transferring accounts to the new provider's platform and expect the transfer to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019. QNB receives a percentage of the revenue generated but is responsible for salaries and expenses of advisors who are QNB employees. Retail brokerage and advisory revenue was $370,000 for 2018 compared with $436,000 in 2017, a decline of $66,000, or 15.1%. There were less sales in front-loaded products, such as annuities and alternative investments (which include private equity, hedge funds, managed futures, real estate REITs\u201d, commodities and derivatives contracts) in 2018 than in 2017, resulting in a $103,000 reduction of revenues. In 2017 and throughout 2018, there was a transition to move toward advanced advisory fees based on assets under management in lieu of fees per transaction; advisory fees increased $87,000 comparing 2018 to 2017. In 2018, the net income provided by QNB Financial Services was $22,000, compared with $13,000 in net income for 2017.\nIncome on bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) represents the earnings and death benefits on life insurance policies in which the Bank is the beneficiary. The insurance carriers reset the rates on these policies annually taking into consideration the interest rate environment as well as mortality costs. The existing policies have rate floors which minimize how low the earnings rate can go. Some of these policies are currently at their floor. Income on these policies during 2017 was $345,000, including a death benefit of $52,000, compared to $291,000 for 2018.\n- 29 -\nMerchant income represents fees charged to merchants for the Bank's handling of credit card or charge sales. Merchant income was $326,000 for 2018, a decrease of $19,000, or 5.5%, from the amount reported in 2017. The decrease in merchant income is primarily a result of competitive pricing and a loss of customers.\nThe fixed-income securities portfolio represents a significant portion of QNB's earning assets and is also a primary tool in liquidity and asset/liability management. QNB actively manages its fixed-income portfolio to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve, changes in spread relationships in different sectors, and for liquidity purposes. Management continually reviews strategies that will result in an increase in the yield or improvement in the structure of the investment portfolio, including monitoring credit and concentration risk in the portfolio. In addition, the Corporation owns a small portfolio of equity securities for the purpose of generating both dividend income and capital appreciation.\nNet gains on investment securities decreased $1,576,000 to a net loss of $76,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with a gain of $1,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in greater opportunities for profitable sales in 2017 compared with 2018. QNB sold equity investment securities during 2018 to minimize potential future losses on certain securities. The prolonged decline in market value of one equity security in 2017 resulted in recording other than temporary impairment charges of $80,000. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $1,477,000 in 2017. Strong performance in the U.S. equity markets during 2017, enabled QNB to sell some equity holdings and recognize gains. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $5,000 and $23,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the following two years. The adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) effective January 1, 2018 requires the Company to record unrealized gains or losses on equity securities through earnings, rather than in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders' equity. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $336,000 during 2018. There was no corresponding unrealized gain or loss recognized on equity securities for 2017, which preceded the effective date for ASU 2016-01.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio, as lack of market volatility and the interest rate environment resulted in declining performance of the portfolio. The net realized gains recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $27,000.\nThe net gain on residential mortgage sales is directly related to the volume of mortgages sold and the timing of the sales relative to the interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loans to be sold are identified at origination. The net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $105,000 and $276,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Mortgage refinance activity decreased in 2018, as rate volatility prompted borrowers to delay borrowing. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $4,478,000 and $9,041,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2018 and 2017 are $33,000 and $66,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets. The remaining $99,000 gain on sale of loans in 2017 is attributed to QNB's portion of a purchased participation loan with no carrying balance that was sold.\nQNB retains servicing rights for residential mortgages sold in the secondary market. A servicing fee is retained on all mortgage loans sold and serviced. QNB recognizes its obligation to service financial assets that are retained in a transfer of assets in the form of a servicing asset. The servicing asset is amortized in proportion to, and over, the period of net servicing income or loss. On a quarterly basis, servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on their fair value. Mortgage servicing income of $126,000 for 2018 and $114,000 for 2017 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income, excluding mortgage servicing income, was $492,000 for 2018, an increase of $164,000 from the amount recorded in 2017. Other non-interest income for 2018 included $48,000 in broker-dealer conversion costs reimbursement and a $57,000 sales tax refund. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, and check sale commissions of $55,000, $15,000, and $18,000, respectively, were partially offset by a reduction in title company income of $10,000, when comparing 2018 to 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal non-interest income was $6,887,000 in 2017 compared with $5,667,000 in 2016, an increase of $1,220,000. Excluding the loss on sale of indirect finance leasing portfolio of $223,000 in 2016, the increase in non-interest income was $997,000, comparing 2017 to 2016.\nFees for services to customers were $1,668,000 for 2017, an increase of $47,000, or 2.9%, from 2016. Overdraft income increased by $44,000, or 3.6%, when comparing 2017 to 2016. ATM and debit card income was $1,749,000 in 2017, an increase of $98,000, or 5.9%, from the amount recorded in 2016. Debit card interchange income increased $103,000, or 6.5%, to $1,694,000 in 2017, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $5,000, to $55,000.\n- 30 -\nRetail brokerage and advisory revenue was $436,000 for 2017 compared with $603,000 in 2016, a decline of $167,000, or 27.7%. There were less sales in front-loaded products in 2017 than in 2016, resulting in a $260,000 reduction of revenues. In 2017 there was a transition to move toward advanced advisory fees based on assets under management in lieu of fees per transaction; advisory fees increased $106,000 comparing 2017 to 2016.\nIncome on BOLI policies during 2017 was $345,000, including a death benefit of $52,000, compared to $308,000 for 2016. Merchant income was $345,000 for 2017, an increase of $11,000, or 3.3%, from the amount reported in 2016.\nNet gains on investment securities increased $826,000 to $1,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $674,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in greater opportunities for profitable sales in 2017 compared with 2016. The prolonged decline in market value of one equity security in 2017 and two equity securities in 2016 resulted in recording other than temporary impairment charges of $80,000 and $192,000, respectively. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $1,477,000 and $566,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $23,000 and $108,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Both the 2017 and 2016 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the next two years. In June 2017, QNB Bank sold five non-performing pooled trust preferred securities ( PreTSL\u201d), with a $2,235,000 carrying value, recording a loss on sale of $15,000, included in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Several years ago, QNB had recorded $1,152,000 in OTTI for four of these five PreTSLs, and subsequently applied any cashflow received to the balance of these non-performing, nonaccrual assets. Improvement in market prices for these PreTSLs during the second quarter 2017 reduced realized losses, and the reduction of approximately $19,000,000 in risk-based assets required for these bonds drove the decision to redeem these debt securities.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio; the net realized gains recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $27,000. The net realized and unrealized losses recorded at December 31, 2016 were $40,000 and fair value was $3,596,000. Unrealized gains on trading activity related to trading securities held at December 31, 2016 totaled $69,000.\nIn October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts and recorded a loss of $223,000.\nThe net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $276,000 and $320,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $9,041,000 and $9,204,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2017 and 2016 are $66,000 and $69,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets. The remaining $99,000 gain on sale of loans in 2017 is attributed to QNB's portion of a purchased participation loan with no carrying balance that was sold. Mortgage servicing income of $114,000 for 2017 and $125,000 for 2016 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income was $328,000 for 2017, an increase of $34,000 from the amount recorded in 2016. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, check sale commissions, and merchant loss recoveries of $50,000, $8,000, $7,000, and $6,000, respectively, were partially offset by a reduction in sales tax refunds of $36,000, when comparing 2017 to 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> Non-interest expense comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy, furniture and equipment, marketing, third party services, FDIC insurance premiums, regulatory assessments and taxes and various other operating expenses. Total non-interest expense was $25,885,000 in 2018, an increase of $2,165,000, or 9.1%, from the $23,720,000 recorded in 2017. QNB's overhead efficiency ratio, which represents the percentage of each dollar of revenue that is used for non-interest expense, is calculated by taking non-interest expense divided by net operating revenue (tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income). QNB's efficiency ratios for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 63.6%, 58.0%, and 61.9%, respectively. The increase in the 2018 efficiency ratio is primarily due to security net gains in 2017 of $1,500,000 versus net losses in 2018 of $412,000 and partially due to tax rate changes under the 2017 Tax Reform Act impacting the tax-equivalence of interest income.\nSalaries and benefits expense is the largest component of non-interest expense. QNB monitors, using various surveys, the competitive salary and benefit information in its markets and makes adjustments when appropriate. Salaries and benefits expense for 2018 was $14,411,000, an increase of $1,290,000 compared with $13,121,000 reported in 2017. Salary expense for 2018 was $11,444,000, an increase of $848,000 compared with $10,596,000 reported in 2017. Included in salary expense in 2018 was incentive compensation plus related payroll taxes of $910,000, a $293,000 increase over incentive compensation in 2017. Benefit expense for 2018 was $2,967,000, an increase of $442,000, or 17.5%, from the amount recorded in 2017 with payroll taxes increasing $13,000 as salary expense increased. Medical premiums increased $336,000. Retirement plan matching and safe harbor increased $75,000 compared to 2017. QNB utilized unvested forfeited 401(k) contributions to offset retirement plan matching in 2018 and 2017.\nNet occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased $389,000, to $4,037,000 when comparing 2018 to 2017, due primarily to increased software, higher depreciation resulting from 2018 renovations and a branch relocation, building and equipment maintenance and branch rent.\nMarketing expense was $927,000 for 2018, a $13,000 increase from the expense recorded in 2017. Marketing expenses related to public relations increased $23,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 2017. QNB's contributions and sponsorships for not-for-profit organizations, events and clubs in the communities it serves are included in public relations expense.\nThird party services are comprised of professional services, including legal, accounting, auditing and consulting services, as well as fees paid to outside vendors for support services of day-to-day operations. These support services include correspondent banking services, statement printing and mailing, investment security safekeeping and supply management services. Third party services increased $281,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to increased legal services of $62,000, information technology third party services of $69,000, tax preparation fees of $36,000 related to method changes implemented for the 2017 returns, and other third-party services.\nTelephone, postage and supplies expense decreased $119,000, or 14.8%, to $685,000 in 2018, compared with 2017. Supplies expense decreased $21,000 in 2018, as additional supplies related to EMV chip debit card production were purchased in 2017. Telecommunications expense decreased $74,000 due cost savings related to the consolidation of services. Postage expense decreased $24,000; additional expense was incurred in 2017 due to the issuance to EMV chip debit cards.\nFDIC insurance premium expense increased $47,000, or 8.1%, in 2018. The premium assessment formula for small institutions was changed by the FDIC and implemented in late 2016 and is based on asset growth and related risk assumptions determined by the FDIC as well as capital. Small institutions, for FDIC premium assessments purposes, are defined as those with total consolidated assets less than $10 billion. On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36%. Because the reserve ratio has exceeded 1.35%, a change impacting QNB's deposit insurance assessment occurred under the FDIC regulations: Small institutions were awarded assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. On January 24, 2019, QNB was notified by the FDIC that its preliminary estimated credit was approximately $234,000, which would be recognized in future periods.\nState tax expense represents the payment of the Pennsylvania Shares Tax and Pennsylvania sales and use tax. State tax expense was $727,000 and $687,000 for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $3,000 of the expense in this category. The increase in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of growth of the Bank's capital.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $224,000, or 9.5%, primarily due to check card expense, employee training and business development costs.\n- 32 -\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal non-interest expense was $23,720,000 in 2017, an increase of $1,557,000, or 7.0%, from the $22,163,000 recorded in 2016. Salaries and benefits expense for 2017 was $13,121,000, an increase of $1,110,000 compared with $12,011,000 reported in 2016. Salary expense for 2017 was $10,596,000, an increase of $1,078,000 compared with $9,518,000 reported in 2016. Included in salary expense in 2017 was incentive compensation plus related payroll taxes of $617,000, a $418,000 increase over incentive compensation in 2016. Benefit expense for 2017 was $2,525,000, an increase of $32,000, or 1.3%, from the amount recorded in 2016 with payroll taxes increasing $52,000 as salary expense increased. Retirement plan matching and safe harbor increased $56,000 compared to 2016; QNB utilized unvested forfeited 401(k) contributions to offset retirement plan matching in 2017. Post-retirement life insurance expense decreased $71,000 due to a death claim which reduced the post-retirement liability.\nNet occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased $145,000, to $3,648,000 when comparing 2017 to 2016, due primarily to increased software, building and equipment maintenance and branch rent, offset in part by lower depreciation.\nMarketing expense was $914,000 for 2017, a $108,000 increase from the expense recorded in 2016. Marketing expenses related to public relations increased $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016. QNB contributions and sponsorships for not-for-profit organizations, events and clubs in the communities it serves is included in public relations expense.\nThird party services decreased $83,000 when comparing the two periods, due to decreased legal services and other third-party services.\nTelephone, postage and supplies expense increased $52,000, or 6.9%, to $804,000 in 2017, compared with 2016. Supplies expense decreased $11,000 in 2017, as additional supplies related to EMV chip debit card production, anticipated throughout 2017, were purchased in 2016. Telecommunications expense increased $41,000 due increased data line capacity. Postage expense increased $22,000.\nFDIC insurance premium expense increased $9,000, or 1.6%, in 2017, due to a change in the premium assessment formula announced by the FDIC in 2016, establishing reduced premium assessment formulas for small institutions.\nState tax expense was $687,000 and $666,000 for the years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $2,000 of the expense in this category. The increase in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of growth of the Bank's capital.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $195,000, or 9.0%, primarily due to check card expense, offset in part by a reduction in foreclosure expense.\nIncome Taxes\nApplicable income tax expense and effective tax rates were $1,557,000, or 12.1%, for 2018 compared with $5,900,000, or 41.6%, for 2017. Under the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21%; therefore, QNB recorded a charge reflecting the revaluation of its net deferred tax assets from 34% to 21% at December 31, 2017 resulting in additional tax expense of $2,054,000. In 2018, QNB elected to change its tax methods for bad debt conformity and for loan originations costs effective with the filing of the 2017 tax return which resulted in a tax benefit of $415,000. These discrete tax items were recorded in 2018.\n- 33 -\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> Summary Impact of 2017 Tax Reform Act and Discrete Tax Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted net income excluding impact\nof discrete items and tax legislation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax provision, discrete items and revaluation of\nnet deferred tax asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,054\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported Net Income (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding impact\nof discrete items and tax legislation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of discrete items and tax legislation on\ndiluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported Diluted Earnings per Share (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the event of disclosure or release of non-GAAP financial measures, the SEC Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate excluding the discrete items was 15.3% primarily due to the decrease in the tax rate from 34% to 21%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate excluding the Tax Reform charge was 27.1%. The higher effective tax rate year over year is predominately a result of tax-exempt income from loans and securities comprising a smaller proportional share of pre-tax income than the prior year and greater state tax expense. QNB expects the effective tax rate in 2019 to be similar to the 15.3%, less than the 21% corporate rate, due to its holdings of tax-free assets, including municipal bonds, municipal loans, and life insurance contracts.

As of December 31, 2018, QNB held no securities of any one issue or any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government and its agencies) that were in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity.\nThe QNB investment portfolio represents a significant portion of earning assets and interest income. QNB actively manages the investment portfolio in an attempt to maximize earnings, while considering liquidity needs, interest rate risk and credit risk. The decrease of the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets in 2018 is due to loan growth. Proceeds from the sale of investments were $9,061,000 in 2018 compared with $42,509,000 during 2017.\nIn addition to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities, proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments of securities were $48,074,000 in 2018 compared with $52,994,000 in 2017. During 2018, $36,236,000 of investment securities were purchased compared with $85,265,000 during 2017.\nThe balance of U.S. Government agency securities decreased $2,115,000 to $68,409,000 at December 31, 2018 and represents 19.3% of the investment portfolio compared with 18.6% at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of two securities. U.S. Government agency issued CMO and MBS balances decreased $17,601,000 to $201,404,000 and represents 57.0% of the portfolio compared with 57.7% at December 31, 2017. These bonds provide monthly cash flow to be reinvested in either loans or other securities, potentially at higher yields as rates increase.\nThe balance of municipal securities decreased $10,491,000 to $66,313,000 at December 31, 2018, representing 18.8% of the investment portfolio compared with 20.2% at December 31, 2017. QNB focuses on the financial performance of the underlying issuer for municipal bond purchases in addition to the bond rating of the issuer or the rating of bond insurer, if present. Nineteen bonds with a book value of $8,150,000 were called or matured in 2018 and three bonds were sold for $1,964,000. The demand for tax-exempt municipal securities has declined as the tax-equivalent yield is becoming less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics.\n- 35 -\nQNB owns one collateralized debt obligations ( CDO\u201d) in the form of a pooled trust preferred security. The security is mainly comprised of securities issued by banks or bank holding companies. QNB owns the mezzanine tranche of this security. The security is structured so that the senior and mezzanine tranches are protected from defaults by over-collateralization and cash flow default protection provided by subordinated tranches. The trust preferred security the Bank continues to hold has a carrying balance of $116,000 at December 31, 2018 and represents the senior-most obligation of the trust. There was no credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charge during 2018, 2017 or 2016. Future estimates of fair value of the remaining security could require recording additional OTTI charges through earnings. For additional detail on these securities see Notes 4 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity securities increased $4,446,000 to $9,421,000 at December 31, 2018 from $4,975,000 at December 31, 2017. QNB sold $4,902,000 in equity securities for a net loss of $79,000; QNB purchased $9,763,000 in equities during 2018.\nQNB accounts for its investments by classifying securities into four categories. Debt securities that QNB has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.\nInvestment Portfolio Maturities and Weighted Average Yields\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> December 31,

are based on anticipated payment periods and state and municipal securities which are based on pre-refunded date, if applicable. Tax-exempt securities were adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis and are based on the marginal Federal corporate tax rate of 21% and a Tax Equity and Financial Responsibility Act ( TEFRA\u201d) adjustment for the cost of funds. Weighted average yields on investment securities available-for-sale are based on amortized cost.\n- 36 -\nInvestment Securities - Trading\nIn 2014, QNB established a small percentage of its investment portfolio as trading in an effort to boost yields and income. During the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio, as lack of market volatility and the interest rate environment resulted in declining performance of the portfolio, since its inception in 2014. QNB recorded a net gain of $27,000 for 2017 in non-interest income.\nInvestments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities include securities that management intends to use as part of its liquidity and asset/liability management strategy. These securities may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the securities prepayment or credit risk, the need for liquidity, or growth in loan demand. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of investment debt securities available-for-sale was $344,221,000, or $9,028,000 below the amortized cost of $353,249,000. This compares to a fair value of $374,570,000, or $5,870,000 below the amortized cost of $380,440,000, at December 31, 2017. The available-for-sale portfolio, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, had a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.8 years at December 31, 2018 and 4.3 years at December 31, 2017. The weighted average tax-equivalent yield, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, was 2.38% and 2.36% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe weighted average maturity is based on the stated contractual maturity or likely call date of all securities except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on estimated average life. The maturity of the portfolio could become shorter if interest rates declined and prepayments on MBS and CMOs increased or securities are called. However, the estimated average life could lengthen if interest rates were to increase and principal payments on MBS and CMOs slowed or securities anticipated to be called extend past their call date.\nInvestments Held-To-Maturity Debt Securities\nQNB did not hold any held-to-maturity security during 2018 or 2017.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nQNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. This ASU was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on January 5, 2016 to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The FASB issued ASU 2018-03 in February 2018 which provides technical corrections and improvements to ASU 2016-01. QNB used the modified retrospective method for transition in which the cumulative effect will be recognized at the date of adoption with no restatement of comparative periods presented. QNB reclassified a loss, net of taxes, of $254,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of the equity securities was $4,975,000, or $321,000 below the cost of $5,296,000. Increases and decreases in the fair value were recognized in net income during 2018. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of the equity securities was $9,421,000, or $658,000 below the cost of $10,079,000.\nLoans\nQNB's primary business is to accept deposits and to make loans to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves. Loans are the most significant component of earning assets, and growth in loans to small businesses and residents of these communities has been a primary focus of QNB. Inherent within the lending function is the evaluation and acceptance of credit risk and interest rate risk. QNB manages credit risk associated with its lending activities through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices.\nQNB has comprehensive policies and procedures that define and govern commercial and retail loan originations and the management of risk. All loans are underwritten in a manner that emphasizes the borrowers' capacity to pay. The measurement of capacity to pay delineates the potential risk of non-payment or default. The higher potential for default determines the need for and amount of collateral required. QNB makes unsecured commercial loans when the capacity to pay is considered substantial. As capacity lessens, collateral is required to provide a secondary source of repayment and to mitigate the risk of loss. Various policies and procedures provide guidance to the lenders on such factors as amount, terms, price, maturity and appropriate collateral levels. Each risk factor is considered critical to ensuring that QNB receives an adequate return for the risk undertaken, and that the risk of loss is minimized.\nQNB manages the risk associated with commercial loans by having lenders work in tandem with credit analysts while maintaining independence between personnel. In addition, a Bank loan committee and a committee of the Board of Directors review and approve certain loan requests on a weekly basis. Other than disclosed in the forthcoming Loan Portfolio Table, at December 31, 2018, there was a concentration of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings of 15.8% of total loans and to lessors of nonresidential buildings of 18.1% of total loans, compared with 15.7% and of 17.3% of total loans, respectively, at December 31, 2017. These concentrations were primarily within the commercial real estate categories.\n- 37 -\nQNB moved from an eight-grade risk rating system to a ten-grade system in 2018, further disaggregating the credit quality of the loan portfolio to enhance credit risk strategies.\nQNB's commercial lending activity is focused on small businesses within the local community. Commercial purpose loans are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay these loans depends on the successful operation of the borrower's business. The assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these types of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, to cash. Commercial and industrial loans represent commercial purpose loans that are either secured by collateral other than real estate or unsecured.\nCommercial loans secured by commercial real estate include commercial purpose loans collateralized at least in part by commercial real estate. Some of these loans may not be for the express purpose of conducting commercial real estate transactions. Commercial loans secured by residential real estate are commercial purpose loans generally secured by the business owner's residence or residential investment properties owned by the borrower and rented to tenants. Commercial loans secured by either commercial real estate or residential real estate are originated primarily within the Eastern Pennsylvania market area, are within the Bank's underwriting criteria, and generally include the guarantee of the borrowers. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions are tax-exempt or taxable loans to municipalities, school districts and housing and industrial development authorities. These loans can be general obligations of the municipality or school district repaid through their taxing authority, revenue obligations repaid through the income generated by the operations of the authority, such as a water or sewer authority, or loans issued to a housing and industrial development agency, for which a private corporation is responsible for payments on the loans.\nThe Company originates fixed rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. To reduce interest rate risk, qualifying originations of fixed-rate loans to individuals for 1-4 family residential mortgages with maturities of 15 years or greater are generally sold in the secondary market. Mortgage loan origination activity declined in 2018 with $4,373,000 in residential mortgages originated for sale during 2018, compared with $7,976,000 for 2017. There were no residential mortgage loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nThe home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. These loans are often in a junior lien position and therefore carry a higher risk than first lien 1-4 family residential loans. Risks associated with loans secured by residential properties, either first lien residential mortgages or home equity loans and lines, are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market. Since most loans are secured by a primary or secondary residence, the borrower's continued employment is the greatest risk to repayment.\nThe Company offers a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than loans secured by residential real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess or more likely to decrease in value than real estate. Credit risk in this portfolio is controlled by conservative underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower, and, if secured, the value of the collateral.\nTotal loan receivables at December 31, 2018 were $785,448,000, an increase of $52,165,000, or 7.1%, from December 31, 2017. This follows a 15.8% increase in outstanding loans in 2017. A key financial ratio, loans to deposits, improved slightly to 77.3% at December 31, 2018, compared with 73.8% at December 31, 2017. QNB continues to be committed to make loans available to credit worthy consumers and businesses.\n- 38 -\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> Loan Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Table details final maturity.\nThe following shows the amount of loans due after one year that have fixed interest rates and variable or adjustable interest rates at December 31, 2018:\nLoans with fixed predetermined interest rates: $97,309,000\nLoans with variable or adjustable interest rates: $546,702,000\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation table on Page 42 shows the percentage composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years. There was very little change in the composition of the portfolio between the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Loans secured by commercial real estate represent the largest sector of the portfolio, increasing slightly from 39.1% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 39.3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018, as the balances in this sector grew by $21,723,000, or 7.6%, from $286,867,000 at December 31, 2017 to $308,590,000 at December 31, 2018. While loans secured by commercial real estate represent a significant portion of the total portfolio, the collateral is diversified, including investment properties, manufacturing facilities, office buildings, hospitals, retirement and nursing home facilities, warehouses and owner-occupied facilities. Commercial real estate loans have drawn the attention of the regulators in recent years as a potential source of risk. QNB monitors these types of loans closely, obtaining updated appraisals on loans classified substandard or worse. As detailed in the Allowance for Loan Losses table, QNB had no charge-offs in this category in 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nCommercial loans secured by residential real estate decreased by $3,122,000, or 4.4%, to $68,581,000 at December 31, 2018 and at 8.7% represent a slightly smaller share of the overall portfolio than the 9.8% at December 31, 2017. Some of the properties that serve as collateral for these loans are located outside the Bank's market area and have experienced vacancies and significant declines in market value. Charge-offs in this category have significantly decreased over the past three years. Non-accrual commercial loans secured by residential real estate were $1,102,000, $1,458,000, and $1,866,000 at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and loan charge-offs were $77,000, $23,000, and $120,000, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, approximately $77,000 of the charge-offs were out-of-market investment properties, compared with all of the $23,000 in charge-offs in 2017 and approximately $96,000 of the $120,000 charge-offs in 2016.\n- 39 -\nCommercial and industrial loans, the second largest sector of the portfolio, experienced growth in balances of $15,262,000, or 10.4%, to $162,452,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed a growth in this category of $36,957,000, or 33.5%, in 2017. Commercial and industrial loans represented 20.7% of the portfolio at year-end 2018 compared with 20.1% at December 31, 2017. This category of loans generally presents a greater risk than loans secured by real estate since these loans are either secured by accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, or are unsecured. During 2017, nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan balances decreased $1,431,000 to $3,367,000, the majority of which is due to the partial charge-off of one credit of $896,000 which was downgraded in 2017. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, charge-offs were $0, $960,000, and $140,000, respectively.\nConstruction loans decreased 2.0% from $51,157,000, or 7.0% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017, to $50,135,000, or 6.4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018. These loans are primarily to developers and builders for the construction of residential units or commercial buildings or to businesses for the construction of owner-occupied facilities. This portfolio is diversified among different types of collateral including: 1-4 family residential construction, medical and retirement home facilities, office buildings, hotels and land for development loans. Construction loans are generally made only on projects that have municipal approval. These loans are usually originated to include a short construction period followed by permanent financing provided through a commercial mortgage after construction is complete. Once construction is complete, the balance is moved to the secured by commercial real estate category if the permanent financing is provided by the Bank. There were no charge-offs in the construction loan portfolio since 2011, and no construction loans on non-accrual since 2014.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions increased $5,650,000, or 14.8%, from $38,087,000 at December 31, 2017 to $43,737,000 at December 31, 2018. This sector increased from 5.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 5.6% at December 31, 2018. Many municipalities, counties and school districts refinanced their existing bonds or bank debt and, as a result, QNB had an opportunity to successfully bid on many of these local issues. The increase in 2018 was due to some of the commitments for large projects won during 2016 that started to fund during the first quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act made the tax effective yield on loans to state and political subdivisions less favorable than experienced historically.\nResidential mortgage loans secured by first lien balances increased by $11,635,000, or 20.8%, to $67,453,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed an increase of $8,694,000, or 18.4%, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. In 2018 and 2017, QNB retained some adjustable and fixed rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios.\nBalances in home equity loans and lines increased $1,899,000, or 2.5%, to $77,475,000 at December 31, 2018. During 2018, QNB continued to offer very attractive rates on both variable and fixed rate home equity loans and lines. These attractive rates, along with excellent customer service, including quick turnaround time, contributed to the growth in home equity balances. With continued improvement in home values as well as the local economy, it is expected that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nConsumer loan balances increased $105,000 to $6,785,000 at December 31, 2018. In 2013, QNB reentered the private student loan market through a relationship with iHelp. These student loans are either fixed or variable rate with the rate dependent on the credit scores of the student and/or the cosigner. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of student loans was $3,822,000, an increase of $86,000 compared with December 31, 2017. Student loan balances will decline, as their balances are no longer insured, and QNB ceased funding originations through iHelp.\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans, OREO and repossessed assets and non-performing trust preferred securities. Non-performing assets totaled $9,638,000, or 0.82% of total assets at December 31, 2018, a $396,000 increase over the $9,242,000, or 0.80% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Included in non-performing assets in 2016 is $2,281,000, of pooled trust preferred securities. In June 2017, QNB Bank sold five non-performing pooled trust preferred securities with a $2,235,000 carrying value. The Bank's remaining trust preferred security was returned to accruing status in June 2017.\nTotal non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and troubled debt restructured loans were $9,638,000, or 1.23% of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared with $9,242,000, or 1.26% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Loans on non-accrual status were $7,478,000 at December 31, 2018 compared with $7,921,000 at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns of $1,683,000, charge-offs of $118,000, and loans returned to accruing status of $1,237,000, of which $1,045,000 were performing under troubled debt restructurings; this was partially offset by $2,595,000 being placed on nonaccrual of which $1,747,000 was one commercial relationship. In cases where there is a collateral shortfall on non-accrual loans, specific impairment reserves have been established based on updated collateral values even if the borrower continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Of the total amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018, $3,072,000, or approximately 41% of the loans classified as non-accrual, are current or past due less than 30 days.\n- 40 -\nQNB had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2018 or at December 31, 2017. Total loans that are 30 days or more past due increased $1,722,000 to $5,941,000, representing 0.76% of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared with 0.58% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Restructured loans, as defined in accounting guidance for troubled debt restructuring in ASC 310-40, that have not already been included in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing or in non-accrual loans, totaled $2,160,000 and $1,321,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nQNB held no OREO at December 31, 2018 or 2017. There were no repossessed assets as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> Non-Performing Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management's view is that loans classified as substandard or doubtful that are not included in the past due, non-accrual or restructured categories are potential problem loans. For some of these loans, management may have knowledge of possible credit problems that will cause management to question the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Commercial loans classified as substandard or doubtful, which includes non-performing loans, continue to show improvement. At December 31, 2018, substandard or doubtful loans totaled $18,339,000, an increase of $1,692,000, or 10.2%, from the $16,647,000, reported as of December 31, 2017.\n- 41 -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The determination of an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an analysis of the risks inherent in QNB's loan portfolio. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, makes significant estimates and assumptions. Since the allowance for loan losses is dependent on conditions that may be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for losses on loans. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance.\nManagement closely monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and performs a quarterly analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the level of unallocated reserves. This analysis considers a number of relevant factors including: specific impairment reserves, historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions, levels of and trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, levels of classified loans, trends in the growth rate of loans and concentrations of credit.\nEconomic conditions, nationally and in QNB's market, continued to improve in 2018, and asset quality remained strong. The allowance level stated as a percent of loans receivable increased from 1.07% at December 31, 2017 to 1.12% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses increased to $8,834,000 at year-end 2018 from $7,841,000 at year-end 2017, primarily due to the increase in loans receivable over the same period.\nTable 83: <table> <tr>

Percent gross loans lists the percentage of each loan type to total loans.\nA loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that QNB will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls may not be classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been identified totaled $16,482,000 and $13,584,000, respectively, of which $11,763,000 and $11,125,000, respectively, required no specific allowance for loan loss. The recorded investment in impaired loans requiring an allowance for loan losses was $4,719,000 and $2,459,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related allowance for loan losses associated with these loans was $1,664,000 and $1,392,000, respectively.

loan charge-offs of $137,000, or 0.02% of average loans for 2018 compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of average loans for 2017 and $190,000, or 0.03% of average loans for 2016. The majority of charge-offs recorded during these periods had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loan. The increase in commercial and industrial charge-offs in 2017 is primarily related to a single credit.\n- 43 -\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses of $8,834,000 is adequate as of December 31, 2018, in relation to the estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio.\nPremises and equipment\nPremises and equipment, net of depreciation increased $1,423,000 to $9,918,000 at December 31, 2018, Building improvement and other purchases more than offset depreciation during 2018.\nOther assets\nOther assets, as presented in the table on Page 34, increased $395,000 from $6,584,000 at December 31, 2017 to $6,979,000 at December 31, 2018. Most of the increase in other assets relates to a $405,000 increase to the deferred tax asset resulting from the fair value adjustment on investment securities available-for-sale of $641,000 partially offset by the deferred tax liability on deferred loan costs of $361,000. The detail of the net deferred tax asset can be found in Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIABILITIES\nThe following table presents total liabilities at the dates indicated:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,015,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 993,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,884\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,071,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,053,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nQNB primarily attracts deposits from within its market area by offering various deposit products. These deposits are in the form of time deposits, which include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts ( IRA\u201ds) which have a stated maturity, and non-maturity deposit accounts, which include: non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts.\nTotal deposits increased $21,650,000, or 2.2%, to $1,015,598,000 at December 31, 2018. This follows an increase of $80,593,000, or 8.8%, between 2016 and 2017. QNB has experienced growth in part due to market disruption created by bank mergers in its footprint throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. The growth in deposits as well as the mix of deposits continues to be impacted by customers' reactions to the competition, regulations and the interest rate environment. Many customers are looking for transaction accounts that provide liquidity and pay a reasonable amount of interest. Time deposit balances declined slightly. Customers appear to be looking for the safety of FDIC insured deposits and the stability of a strong local community bank.\nNon-interest-bearing demand accounts decreased slightly by $597,000 to $128,615,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed growth of $10,202,000, or 8.6%, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. These deposits are primarily comprised of business checking accounts and are volatile depending on the timing of deposits and withdrawals. QNB has been successful in attracting new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers, which provides an opportunity for fee income.\nInterest-bearing demand accounts, retail and business interest checking and municipal accounts increased $7,182,000, or 2.4%, to $304,652,000 at December 31, 2018. All segments experienced growth in 2018 except municipal accounts, which decreased $24,463,000. While QNB has been successful in developing relationships with several school districts and municipalities as well as expanding existing relationships, the balances in these accounts are seasonal in nature and can be volatile on a daily basis. Most of the school district taxes are collected during the third quarter of the year and are disbursed over a nine-month period. Business checking increased from $19,937,000 at December 31, 2017 to $41,991,000 at December 31, 2018. Rewards checking balances increased from $55,071,000 at December 31, 2017 to $57,621,000 at December 31, 2018, and Select 50 balances increased from $81,877,000 to $87,598,000 over this same period. Personal interest-bearing balances also increased from $22,421,000 at December 31, 2017 to $23,741,000 at December 31, 2018. QNB continues to open a significant number of new checking accounts.\nMoney Market accounts decreased from $84,562,000 at December 31, 2017 to $78,781,000 at December 31, 2018 due to decreases in both personal and business accounts.\n- 44 -\nTotal savings account balances increased $22,240,000, or 8.6%, to $279,762,000 at December 31, 2018. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the online eSavings account of $22,797,000, or 12.2%, to $208,993,000 at December 31, 2018. The rate on eSavings accounts was changed from 0.65% at the end of 2017 to 0.70% in March 2018, 0.75% in June 2018, 0.80% in September 2018 and to 0.85% in December 2018.\nTotal time deposit account balances were $223,788,000 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,394,000, or 0.6%, from the amount reported at December 31, 2017. As time deposits matured during the past two years, they were frequently reinvested in the high yielding and liquid Rewards or Select 50 checking, money market or eSavings accounts which, in many instances, paid a rate higher than what was offered on short-term time deposits.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> Maturity of Time Deposits of $100,000 or More\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo continue to attract and retain deposits, QNB plans to remain competitive with respect to rates and to continue to deliver products with terms and features that appeal to customers.

Overnight FHLB borrowings declined $10,046,000, to $3,865,000 at December 31, 2018. Commercial sweeps increased $5,162,000, or 12.3%, to $47,007,000 at December 31, 2018.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities comprise accrued expenses including salaries, post-retirement life insurance benefits and income taxes, deferred revenue, and ATM/debit card processing clearing. This category increased $506,000 to $4,185,000 at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity represents an institution's ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. QNB attempts to manage its mix of cash and interest-bearing balances, Federal funds sold and investment securities to match the volatility, seasonality, interest sensitivity and growth trends of its loans and deposits. The Company manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. Liquidity is provided from asset sources through repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities. The portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale and QNB's policy of selling certain residential mortgage originations in the secondary market also provide sources of liquidity. Core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding source for QNB. These deposits and repurchase agreements are generated from a base of consumers, businesses and public funds primarily located in the Company's market area.\n- 45 -\nAn additional source of liquidity is provided by the Bank's membership in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $311,119,000, net of the $3,865,000 outstanding at year-end 2018 and $350,000 FHLB-issued letter of credit. The maximum borrowing capacity changes depending upon the Bank's level of qualifying collateral assets. QNB had $3,865,000 and $13,911,000 in FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Bank maintains four unsecured Federal funds lines with four correspondent banks totaling $46,000,000. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines. Future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn. As part of its contingency funding plan, QNB successfully tested its ability to borrow from these sources during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, equity and available-for-sale securities and loans held-for-sale totaled $367,100,000 at December 31, 2018 and $395,876,000 at December 31, 2017, of which $194,573,000 and $202,887,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and public deposits. This decrease in liquid sources is primarily the result of a $30,349,000 decrease in available-for-sale securities. Management anticipates that these liquid sources are adequate to meet normal fluctuations in loan demand or deposit withdrawals. It is anticipated that the investment portfolio will continue to provide sufficient liquidity as municipal bonds are called and as principal and interest payments on mortgage-backed and CMO securities provide steady cash flow. Increases in interest rates, however, result in decreased cash flow available from the investment portfolio.\nQNB is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services ( CDARS\u201d) program offered by the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. It enables financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on time deposits over $250,000 that are placed in the program. QNB also has available Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d), another program through Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC, which is a product similar to CDARS, but one that provides liquidity like a money market or savings account. QNB had $151,000 in CDARS time deposits at December 31, 2018.\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe following table presents total shareholders' equity at the dates indicated:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surplus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retained earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net\nof tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,046\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $5,778,000, or 5.9%, to $104,348,000 at December 31, 2018 with retained earnings -- net income less dividends paid -- contributing $6,901,000 and the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan contributing $1,372,000.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $3,046,000; $2,495,000, resulting from the decrease in fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio due to increased interest rates at the end of 2018. QNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 202), in the first quarter of 2018 as discussed in Note 1. The implementation of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-02 resulted in reclasses within Shareholders Equity from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax\u201d to Retained earnings\u201d of a $254,000 net loss and a $805,000 net gain, respectively.\nQNB remains well capitalized\u201d based on FDIC requirements.\nCapital Adequacy\nA strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and profitability and to serve the needs of depositors. QNB's shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 was $104,348,000, or 8.88% of total assets, compared with shareholders' equity of $98,570,000, or 8.55% of total assets, at December 31, 2017. Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 included a negative adjustment of $7,132,000 related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available for sale. At December 31, 2017, shareholders' equity included a negative adjustment of $4,086,000, related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available-for-sale. Excluding these adjustments, shareholders' equity to total assets would have been 9.43% and 8.88% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n- 46 -\nAverage shareholders' equity and average total assets were $108,241,000 and $1,176,910,000 for 2018, an increase of 6.7% and 5.4%, respectively, from 2017 average equity and average total assets of $101,496,000 and $1,117,163,000, respectively. The ratio of average total equity to total average assets was 9.20% for 2018, compared with 9.09% for 2017.\nQNB is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to its shareholders pursuant to the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 as amended (the BCL). The BCL operates generally to preclude dividend payments, if the effect thereof would render QNB insolvent, as defined. As a practical matter, QNB's payment of dividends is contingent upon its ability to obtain funding in the form of dividends from the Bank. Under Pennsylvania banking law, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2018, the retained earnings of the Bank totaling $99,009,000 was available for dividends without prior Pennsylvania Department of Banking approval, subject to the regulatory capital requirements discussed below. The approval of the Federal Reserve is required for a state bank member in the Federal Reserve system to pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the Bank's net profits (as defined) for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the Bank can declare dividends in 2019 without approval of the Federal Reserve of approximately $17,365,000 plus an additional amount equal to the Bank's net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. QNB paid dividends to its shareholders of $1.28 per share, $1.24 per share, and $1.20 per share, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nQNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various weights to all assets and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and loan commitments, based on associated risk. QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III\u201d) became effective for QNB on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all the of final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nUnder the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banks. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented. The final rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. QNB and the Bank have enough capital to meet the buffer if it were fully phased in at December 31, 2018.\nQNB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan\u201d) to provide participants a convenient and economical method for investing cash dividends paid on the Company's common stock in additional shares at a discount. The Plan also allows participants to make additional cash purchases of stock at a discount. Stock purchases under the Plan contributed $979,000 and $973,000 to capital during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100,000 shares of QNB's common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not bear a termination date. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 57,883 shares were repurchased under this authorization at an average price of $16.97 and a total cost of $982,000. There were no shares repurchased under the plan since the first quarter of 2009.\n- 47 -\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 established five capital level designations ranging from well capitalized\u201d to critically undercapitalized.\u201d At December 31, 2018 and 2017, management believes that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and have met the well capitalized\u201d criteria.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Capital Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net unrealized securities losses, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale equity securities, net\nof tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (212\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disallowed goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity tier I capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowable portion: Allowance for loan losses and reserve for\nunfunded commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total regulatory capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 911,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 881,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarterly average assets for leverage capital purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,186,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,153,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> Capital Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity tier I capital / risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital / risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total regulatory capital / risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital / average assets (leverage ratio)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nQNB has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, which may require future cash payments.\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2018, significant contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments.

QNB's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and liquidity risk. QNB's liquidity position was discussed in a prior section.\nQNB's largest source of revenue is net interest income, which is subject to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins and interest rate spreads and to provide growth in net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. QNB's Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is responsible for managing interest rate risk and for evaluating the impact of changing interest rate conditions on net interest income.\nQNB uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation considers current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates assumptions for growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when its liabilities (deposits and borrowings) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its earning assets (loans and securities). A liability sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively less net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when they decline. Based on our simulation analysis, management believes QNB's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2018 is liability sensitive. Management expects that market interest rates may gradually increase in the next 12 months, based on the economic environment and policy of the Federal Reserve.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 assuming instantaneous rate shocks, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the subsequent twelve months is projected to decrease when interest rates are higher than current rates.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> Estimated change in net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComputations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect QNB's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nQNB is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. At December 31, 2018, QNB did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\n- 49 -\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nDisclosure of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the most sensitive of these issues. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of QNB, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires QNB to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. QNB evaluates estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the determination of the valuation of other real estate owned, other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities, the determination of impairment of restricted bank stock, the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. QNB bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment\nSecurities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. For equity securities, once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the equity security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320-10 as it relates to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). This accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not, the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held to maturity debt securities, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the non-credit portion of a previous other-than-temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nQNB considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable known and inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio. The allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses. The provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered necessary by management.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on management's continual review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance is determined by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves to all other loans. The portion of the allowance that is allocated to impaired loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral. The general reserves are based on the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the loan portfolio, credit concentration trends, delinquency and loss experience, as well as other qualitative factors such as current economic trends.\nManagement emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits. Credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio. QNB's lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower's circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral. A loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of collection. Each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower's financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan. An independent loan review group tests risk assessments and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management meets monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and quarterly to review the allowance for loan losses.\n- 50 -\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. If circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, increases to the allowance may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.\nForeclosed Assets\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2018, QNB sponsored stock-based compensation plans, administered by a Board committee, under which both qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted periodically to certain employees. QNB accounts for all awards granted under stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date. QNB estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature.\nIncome Taxes\nQNB accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method in accordance with income tax accounting guidance, ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available. Because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may, at least in part, be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations - Overview\nQNB Corp. ( QNB\u201d or the Company\u201d) earns its net income primarily through its subsidiary, QNB Bank (the Bank\u201d). Net interest income, or the spread between the interest, dividends and fees earned on loans and investment securities and the expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, is the primary source of operating income for QNB. QNB seeks to achieve sustainable and consistent earnings growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk levels approved by the Board of Directors. Due to its limited geographic area, comprised principally of Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, growth is pursued through expansion of existing customer relationships and building new relationships by stressing a consistent high level of service at all points of contact.\nTabular information presented throughout management's discussion and analysis, other than share and per share data, is presented in thousands of dollars.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,335,000, or $3.25 per share on a diluted basis. This compares to 2017 net income of $8,289,000, or $2.41 per share on a diluted basis and 2016 net income of $8,924,000, or $2.63 per share on a diluted basis. Two important measures of profitability in the banking industry are an institution's return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity. Return on average assets was 0.96%, 0.74% and 0.87% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and return on average shareholders' equity was 10.47%, 8.17% and 9.45%, respectively, during those same periods.\n2018 versus 2017\nThe results for 2018 include the following significant components:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $2,593,000, or 8.0%, to $35,015,000 for 2018. \n \u2022 The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased one basis points to 3.13% for 2018 from 3.14% for 2017. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses totaled $1,130,000 for 2018, compared with $1,400,000 for 2017. \n \u2022 Non-interest income for 2018 was $4,892,000, a decrease of $1,995,000, or 29.0%, compared with 2017.

Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed). Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing deposits.\nFor purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the table that appears above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared.\nThe net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.\n2018 versus 2017\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2018 increased $1,829,000, or 5.4%, to $35,833,000. The net interest margin, which decreased slightly to 3.13% was unfavorably impacted by increased rates on deposits and borrowings and less favorable tax-equivalent yields on tax-exempt municipal investments and loans as the Federal tax rate decreased from 34% to 21%. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 18 basis points from 3.67% for 2017 to 3.85% for 2018 with the yield on loans increasing 16 basis points, favorably impacted by a $38,565,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and an 11 basis point increase in the related yield and a $26,117,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 46 basis point increase in the related yield, while the yield on investment securities declined slightly to 2.32%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points from 0.64% for 2017 to 0.88% for 2018 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.65% to 0.86% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $31,842,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.\nMarket disruption caused by local bank consolidation positively impacted both loan and deposit growth which was partially offset by the competitive local interest rate market for quality loans and deposits. Net interest spread decreased six basis points to 2.97% for 2018 compared to 3.03% for 2017. Average earning assets increased by $61,070,000, or 5.6%, to $1,143,506,000 for 2018, with average loans increasing $84,262,000, or 12.3%, to $766,744,000, while average investment securities decreased $17,699,000, or 4.5%, to $372,803,000. With the growth in earning assets occurring primarily in the loan portfolio, the mix of earning assets changed, which also contributed to relative stability of the net interest margin, as investment securities generally earn a lower yield than loans. The growth in earning assets was funded by a $40,656,000, or 4.2%, increase in average total deposits to $1,003,154,000, and the increase in average short-term borrowing, comprising sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings, of $12,267,000, or 25.2%.\n- 21 -\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law, reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This reduction in the tax rate had an impact on the tax-equivalent yield on certain interest-earning assets. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the 2017 interest margin of approximately seven basis points.\n2017 versus 2016\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2017 increased $3,859,000, or 12.8%, to $34,004,000. The net interest margin, which increased to 3.14% was favorably impacted by a $59,846,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and a 12-basis point increase in the related yield and a $17,451,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 38-basis point increase in the related yield. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 17 basis points from 3.50% for 2016 to 3.67% for 2017 with the yield on loans increasing 13 basis points while the yield on investment securities declined slightly to 2.39%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased seven basis points from 0.57% for 2016 to 0.64% for 2017 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.58% to 0.65% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $55,717,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.\n- 22 -\nAverage Balances, Rates, and Interest Income

</tr>\n</table>\n (1) Loan fees have been included in the change in interest income totals presented. Non-accrual loans and investment securities have been included in average balances. \n (2) Changes due to both volume and rates have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amount change in each. \n (3) Interest income on loans and securities is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. \nThe Rate-Volume Analysis tables, as presented on a tax-equivalent basis, highlight the impact of changing rates and volumes on interest income and interest expense. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased $4,334,000 to $44,018,000 for 2018, while total interest expense increased $2,505,000 to $8,185,000. Volume growth in earning assets contributed an additional $3,223,000 of interest income and interest rate increases contributed to additional interest income of $1,111,000. Rate-related interest expense increased $2,332,000, while volume-related interest expense increased $173,000.\nInvestments\n2018 versus 2017\nInterest income on available-for-sale and equity investment securities decreased $650,000 when comparing the two years. The decrease in average balances contributed to $400,000 of the decrease, while rates contributed the remaining $250,000 decrease. The average yield on the available-for-sale and equity investment portfolio declined slightly to 2.32% for 2018 compared to 2.38% for 2017. The decrease in the investment portfolio is due to funding needs to support loan growth.\n- 24 -\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities decreased $24,000, due to a decrease in average balances totaling $1,888,000, which was partially offset by an increase in the yield on the portfolio of one basis points from 1.78% for 2017 to 1.79% for 2018. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2018 as a result of the rising rates during the year.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities decreased $631,000. The decline in yield of 62 basis points from 3.91% in 2017 to 3.29% in 2018 contributed to a $441,000 reduction in interest income. Average balances, which decreased $4,858,000, contributed $190,000 to the interest income decline. QNB had purchased many municipal securities when rates were significantly higher. Many of these bonds have either reached maturity or their call dates and are being replaced with municipal bonds with lower yields. Typically, QNB purchased municipal bonds with 10- to 15-year maturities with call dates between 2 and 5 years. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the yield on municipal bonds of approximately 65 basis points to 3.26%. Future demand for tax-exempt municipal securities is uncertain, as the tax-equivalent yield is less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics. This portfolio is expected to continue to decline as there are $21,857,000 in municipal bonds with a 2018 tax-equivalent yield of 3.51% that are expected to be called or mature in 2019. The current yield on replacement bonds is below this threshold.\nAll the mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMO\u201d) securities owned by QNB are issued by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises ( GSE\u201d) and carry the implicit backing of the U.S. Government, but they are not direct obligations of the U.S. Government. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased $18,000 primarily due to a decrease of $10,359,000, or 4.6%, in average balances. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by nine basis points from 2.05% for 2017 to 2.14% for 2018. This portfolio generally provides higher yields relative to agency bonds and provides monthly cash flow which can be used for liquidity purposes or can be reinvested as interest rates increase.\n2017 versus 2016\nInterest income on trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity investment securities increased $691,000 when comparing the two years. The increase in average balances contributed to $613,000 of the increase, while better rates contributed the remaining $78,000 increase. The average yield on the investment portfolio declined slightly to 2.39% for 2017 compared to 2.42% for 2016. The increase in the investment portfolio is due to investment opportunities at a yield comparable to the overall portfolio yield in late 2016 compared with previous periods, as well as continuing increase in deposits.\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities increased $193,000, due to an increase in average balances totaling $12,767,000, which was offset by a decline in the yield on the portfolio of five basis points from 1.83% for 2016 to 1.78% for 2017. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2017 as a result of the rising rates during the year.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities increased $12,000. Average balances, which increased $2,785,000, contributed $113,000 to interest income. This was partially offset by a 13-basis point decline in yield from 4.04% in 2016 to 3.91% in 2017 contributing to a $101,000 reduction in interest income.\nInterest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs increased $578,000 primarily due to an increase of $21,436,000, or 10.6%, in average balances. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by seven basis points from 1.98% for 2016 to 2.05% for 2017.\nLoans\n2018 versus 2017\nThe largest category of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans. This category of loans includes commercial purpose loans secured by either commercial properties such as office buildings, hotels, factories, warehouses, medical facilities and retail establishments, or residential real estate, usually the residence of the business owner or investment properties. The category also includes construction and land development loans. Income on commercial real estate loans increased $2,226,000. The increase in average balances of $38,565,000, or 9.8%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,755,000. The 11-basis point increase in yield, from 4.55% in 2017 to 4.66% in 2018 resulted in an increase of interest income of $471,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans, the second largest category, increased $1,917,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $26,117,000, or 20.3%, to $154,958,000 for 2018, resulting in a $1,214,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 46 basis points to 5.10% providing an additional $703,000 in interest income. Many of the loans in this category are indexed to the prime interest rate, which increased by one quarter of one percent four times since December 2017.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $26,000 from 2017. When comparing the same periods, average balances increased $7,270,000 to $43,012,000, which contributed a $287,000 increase in interest income. This increase was offset by a decrease in the average yield on\n- 25 -\nthe tax-exempt loan portfolio from 3.95% for 2017 to 3.22% for 2018, resulting in a decline in interest income of $313,000. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the yield on municipal bonds of approximately 66 basis points to 3.29%.\nQNB strives to become the local consumer lender of choice\u201d, and to affect this goal, QNB has refocused its retail lending efforts by strengthening the management of the area, adding new product offerings and by increasing marketing and promotion. The positive impact of this renewed focus has been year-over-year growth in balances in all three categories of retail lending: residential mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. Overall, interest income for retail lending increased $893,000 in 2018 compared with 2017, driven by the increase in average balances and average rate increases on home equity and consumer loans. 2017 tax reform legislation changed the tax deductibility of home equity interest for borrowers.\nIncome on home equity loans increased by $422,000 when comparing 2018 and 2017. During 2018 and 2017, QNB offered attractive rates on both variable rate and fixed rate home equity loans, which contributed to an increase in average balances totaling $798,000, or 1.2%, to $67,3762,000 when comparing 2018 and 2017. The yield on the home equity portfolio increased 58 basis points to 4.44% when comparing the two years, primarily due to prime rate increases. The demand for home equity loans has improved along with the recovery in home values. We expect that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nGiven the low yields on alternative investment securities, QNB retained certain hybrid adjustable rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios. As a result, average residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $11,070,000, or 21.6%, to $62,312,000 for 2018. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio remained fairly level at 3.86% for 2018 compared to 3.89% for 2017. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $406,000 in 2018.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $65,000. As with all other categories of retail loans, consumer loans at QNB experienced growth in average balances in 2018, which increased $442,000, or 6.7%, led by student loan growth. Growth in volume contributed $23,000 to the increase in income, and the 60-basis point increase in the average yield from 5.39% in 2017 to 5.99% in 2018 contributed to an increase in interest income of $42,000.\n2017 versus 2016\nIncome on commercial real estate loans increased $3,142,000. The increase in average balances of $59,846,000, or 17.9%, contributed an increase in interest income of $2,650,000. The 12-basis point increase in yield, from 4.43% in 2016 to 4.55% in 2017 resulted in an increase of interest income of $492,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans increased $1,235,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $17,451,000, or 15.7%, to $128,841,000 for 2017, resulting in a $744,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 38 basis points to 4.64% providing an additional $491,000 in interest income.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $58,000 from 2016. When comparing the same periods, average balances decreased $2,896,000 to $35,742,000, which contributed a $111,000 decrease in interest income. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio from 3.80% for 2016 to 3.95% for 2017, resulting in additional interest income of $53,000.\nIndirect lease financing receivables represent loans to small businesses that are collateralized by equipment. In October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts. Interest income in 2016 included $702,000 from these contracts.\nInterest income for retail lending increased $577,000 in 2017 compared with 2016, driven by both the increase in average balances and rising rates in 2017.\nAverage residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $6,009,000, or 13.3%, to $51,242,000 for 2017. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio remained level at 3.89% for 2017 and 2016. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $237,000 in 2017.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $110,000. Average balances in this segment increased $1,663,000. This growth in volume contributed $98,000 to the increase in income, and the 19-basis point increase in the average yield from 5.20% in 2016 to 5.39% in 2017 contributed to an increase in interest income of $12,000.\n- 26 -\nDeposits and Borrowings\n2018 versus 2017\nEarning assets are funded primarily by deposits, which increased on average by $40,656,000, or 4.2%, to $1,003,154,000, when comparing 2018 and 2017. Total interest expense for 2018 was $8,185,000 compared with $5,680,000 for 2017, an increase of $2,505,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $2,086,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $419,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 21 basis points; the rate paid on borrowings increased 58 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as the competition for deposits increases.\nConsistent with the past several years, the growth in deposits during 2018 was centered in accounts with greater liquidity. Average non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $8,814,000, or 7.2%, to $130,633,000 for 2018; QNB has been successful in increasing both personal and business checking accounts. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $24,432,000, or 14.4%, to $194,372,000 for 2018 compared with 2017, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $336,000 to $689,000 for 2018. The average rate paid increased 14 basis points to 0.35% for 2018 compared to 0.21% for 2017. Interest-bearing business checking account average balances increased by $14,265,000, or 72.8%, and related interest expense increased $276,000, or 77 basis points in yield, when comparing the two years. This was primarily due to one large commercial customer consolidating both existing and external accounts. Also included in this category is QNB-Rewards checking, a tiered-rate checking account product. In order to receive the high rate a customer must receive an electronic statement, have one direct deposit or other ACH transaction and have at least 12 check card purchase transactions post and clear per statement cycle. If these qualifications are not met, the rate paid for 2017 was 0.20% increasing during 2018 to 0.25%. For 2018, the average balance in this product was $54,188,000 and the related interest expense was $338,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.62%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2017 was $50,907,000, yielding 0.55%. The rates paid on the QNB-Rewards product, assuming qualifications are met, is attractive relative to competitors' offerings as well as other QNB products. This product also generates fee income through the use of the check card. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $99,451,000 for 2017 to $106,337,000 for 2018. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.05% for both years.\nAverage money market accounts decreased $6,490,000, or 7.7%, to $77,713,000 for 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to higher yielding certificates of deposits. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $80,000 to $329,000 for 2018 compared with 2017. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.42% for 2018, an increase of 12 basis points compared with 2017. The balances in this category primarily comprise Select money market accounts, a product that pays a tiered rate based on account balances. The balances remaining in these accounts for 2018 were primarily at higher-yielding tiers.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $753,000 to $1,537,000 for 2018. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $3,641,000, or 3.3%, to $106,411,000 while the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased 73 basis points to 1.44% for 2018 from 0.71% for 2017. Most of these accounts are indexed to the Federal funds rate with negotiated rate floors between 0.25% and 0.50%. Many of these deposits are seasonal in nature and are received during the third quarter as tax receipts are collected and are withdrawn over the course of the next year.\nQNB's online e-Savings product is the largest category of savings deposits and was created to compete with other online savings accounts. Average balances grew $13,395,000, or 7.4%, to $195,258,000 in 2018 compared with $181,863,000 in 2017. The rate on this product increased from 0.65% at the end of 2017 to 0.85% in December 2018. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.58% for 2017 and 0.79% for 2018. The yield on this account may rise along with market rates and as competition for savings balances increases. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $3,657,000, or 5.4%, to $71,688,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.62% for 2018, a 16-basis point increase from 2017 while interest expense increased $501,000, from $1,156,000 to $1,657,000 over the same period. The growth in balances appears to reflect the desire for liquidity and a better rate than short-term time deposits.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $416,000, to $3,301,000 in 2018, due to a 22-basis point increase in yield, from 1.27% in 2017 to 1.45% in 2018. The increase in average balances was $489,000 in 2018, to $227,079,000. Similar to fixed-rate loans and investment securities, time deposits reprice over time and, therefore, have less of an immediate impact on costs in either a rising or falling rate environment. However, the maturity and repricing characteristics of time deposits tend to be shorter.\nApproximately $78,931,000, or 35.3%, in time deposits will reprice or mature over the next 12 months compared with 42.7% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017. The average rate paid on these time deposits is approximately 1.06%. QNB has extended the maturity of the time deposit portfolio by offering attractive rates at terms greater than 12 months. Interest expense is expected to increase along with competition for deposits.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2018 of $38,172,000 and $22,767,000, respectively. Interest\n- 27 -\nexpense on short-term borrowings increased by $419,000 to $672,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances of borrowings from correspondent banks increased $13,396,000. The increase in these borrowings was the primary contributor to the increase in the average rate paid from 0.52% to 1.10%.\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal interest expense for 2017 was $5,680,000 compared with $4,733,000 for 2016, an increase of $947,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $848,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $99,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on both interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearings liabilities increased seven basis points; the rate paid on borrowings increased 14 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as short-term interest rates begin to rise and the competition for deposits increases.\nAverage non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $14,240,000, or 13.2%, to $121,819,000 for 2017. Business checking account average balances increased by $11,707,000, or 13.5%, when comparing the two years. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $16,342,000, or 10.6%, to $169,940,000 for 2017 compared with 2016, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $38,000 to $353,000 for 2017. The average rate paid remained unchanged at 0.21% for 2016 and 2017. The average balance in QNB-Rewards checking was $50,907,000 and the related interest expense was $281,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.55%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2016 was $44,918,000, yielding 0.56%. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $108,680,000 for 2016 to $119,033,000 for 2017. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.06% for both years. Average money market accounts increased $12,947,000, or 18.2%, to $84,203,000 for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to more liquid accounts. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $57,000 to $249,000 for 2017 compared with 2016. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.30% for 2017, an increase of three basis points compared with 2016.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $433,000 to $784,000 for 2017. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $7,992,000, or 7.8%, to $110,052,000 and the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased 37 basis points to 0.71% for 2017 from 0.34% for 2016.\nOnline eSavings account average balances grew $13,503,000, or 8.0%, to $181,863,000 in 2017 compared with $168,360,000 in 2016. The rate on this product was changed from 0.55% at the end of 2016 to 0.65% in late December 2017. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.50% for 2016 and 0.58% for 2017. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $6,612,000, or 10.8%, to $68,031,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.46% for 2017, a six-basis point increase from 2016 while interest expense increased $233,000, from $923,000 to $1,156,000 over the same period.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $87,000, to $2,885,000 in 2017, due to a four-basis point increase in yield, from 1.23% in 2016 to 1.27% in 2017. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average balances of $1,679,000 in 2017, to $226,590,000.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2017 of $39,301,000 and $9,371,000, respectively. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $99,000 to $253,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances increased $8,472,000 to $48,672,000, and the average rate paid increased 14 basis points, from 0.38% to 0.52%.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents management's determination of the amount necessary to be charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. QNB recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,130,000, $1,400,000 and $30,000 for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the $220,000 reversal in allowance for loan losses associated with the sale of the indirect lease finance portfolio, the 2016 provision would have been $250,000. Net loan charge-offs were $137,000, or 0.02% of total average loans for 2018 compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of total average loans in 2017 and $190,000, or 0.03%, in 2016. The majority of the loans charged off during 2018 and 2017 had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loans. Deterioration in credit quality or significant growth in the loan portfolio may result in a higher provision for loan losses in 2019.\n- 28 -\nNon-Interest Income\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>

fees and service charges. Total non-interest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and check card income, retail brokerage and advisory income, income on bank-owned life insurance, merchant income and gains and losses on investment securities and residential mortgage loans. Total non-interest income was $4,892,000 in 2018 compared with $6,887,000 in 2017, a decrease of $1,995,000.\nFees for services to customers are primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts. These fees were $1,699,000 for 2018, an increase of $31,000, or 1.9%, from 2017. Overdraft income, which represented approximately 78% and 76% of total fees for services to customers in 2018 and 2017, respectively, increased by $50,000, or 3.9%, when comparing 2018 to 2017. The increase in overdraft income primarily reflects an increase in the number of overdraft occurrences.\nATM and debit card income is primarily comprised of transaction income on debit cards and ATM cards and ATM surcharge income for the use of QNB's ATM machines by non-QNB customers. ATM and debit card income was $1,895,000 in 2018, an increase of $146,000, or 8.3%, from the amount recorded in 2017. Debit card interchange income increased $147,000, or 8.7%, to $1,841,000 in 2018, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $1,000 to $54,000. The growth in checking accounts and card usage contributed to the increase in debit card income, including the QNB Rewards checking product, a tiered-rate checking account which requires, among other terms, the posting of a minimum of twelve debit card purchase transactions per statement cycle to receive the high interest rate.\nQNB provides securities and advisory services under the name QNB Financial Services through an independent third-party registered Broker/Dealer and Registered Investment Advisor. QNB terminated its contract with its third-party broker-dealer effective August 1, 2018 and entered into a similar arrangement with another third-party provider. QNB Financial Services staff are in the process of transferring accounts to the new provider's platform and expect the transfer to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019. QNB receives a percentage of the revenue generated but is responsible for salaries and expenses of advisors who are QNB employees. Retail brokerage and advisory revenue was $370,000 for 2018 compared with $436,000 in 2017, a decline of $66,000, or 15.1%. There were less sales in front-loaded products, such as annuities and alternative investments (which include private equity, hedge funds, managed futures, real estate REITs\u201d, commodities and derivatives contracts) in 2018 than in 2017, resulting in a $103,000 reduction of revenues. In 2017 and throughout 2018, there was a transition to move toward advanced advisory fees based on assets under management in lieu of fees per transaction; advisory fees increased $87,000 comparing 2018 to 2017. In 2018, the net income provided by QNB Financial Services was $22,000, compared with $13,000 in net income for 2017.\nIncome on bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) represents the earnings and death benefits on life insurance policies in which the Bank is the beneficiary. The insurance carriers reset the rates on these policies annually taking into consideration the interest rate environment as well as mortality costs. The existing policies have rate floors which minimize how low the earnings rate can go. Some of these policies are currently at their floor. Income on these policies during 2017 was $345,000, including a death benefit of $52,000, compared to $291,000 for 2018.\n- 29 -\nMerchant income represents fees charged to merchants for the Bank's handling of credit card or charge sales. Merchant income was $326,000 for 2018, a decrease of $19,000, or 5.5%, from the amount reported in 2017. The decrease in merchant income is primarily a result of competitive pricing and a loss of customers.\nThe fixed-income securities portfolio represents a significant portion of QNB's earning assets and is also a primary tool in liquidity and asset/liability management. QNB actively manages its fixed-income portfolio to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve, changes in spread relationships in different sectors, and for liquidity purposes. Management continually reviews strategies that will result in an increase in the yield or improvement in the structure of the investment portfolio, including monitoring credit and concentration risk in the portfolio. In addition, the Corporation owns a small portfolio of equity securities for the purpose of generating both dividend income and capital appreciation.\nNet gains on investment securities decreased $1,576,000 to a net loss of $76,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with a gain of $1,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in greater opportunities for profitable sales in 2017 compared with 2018. QNB sold equity investment securities during 2018 to minimize potential future losses on certain securities. The prolonged decline in market value of one equity security in 2017 resulted in recording other than temporary impairment charges of $80,000. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $1,477,000 in 2017. Strong performance in the U.S. equity markets during 2017, enabled QNB to sell some equity holdings and recognize gains. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $5,000 and $23,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the following two years. The adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) effective January 1, 2018 requires the Company to record unrealized gains or losses on equity securities through earnings, rather than in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders' equity. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $336,000 during 2018. There was no corresponding unrealized gain or loss recognized on equity securities for 2017, which preceded the effective date for ASU 2016-01.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio, as lack of market volatility and the interest rate environment resulted in declining performance of the portfolio. The net realized gains recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $27,000.\nThe net gain on residential mortgage sales is directly related to the volume of mortgages sold and the timing of the sales relative to the interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loans to be sold are identified at origination. The net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $105,000 and $276,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Mortgage refinance activity decreased in 2018, as rate volatility prompted borrowers to delay borrowing. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $4,478,000 and $9,041,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2018 and 2017 are $33,000 and $66,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets. The remaining $99,000 gain on sale of loans in 2017 is attributed to QNB's portion of a purchased participation loan with no carrying balance that was sold.\nQNB retains servicing rights for residential mortgages sold in the secondary market. A servicing fee is retained on all mortgage loans sold and serviced. QNB recognizes its obligation to service financial assets that are retained in a transfer of assets in the form of a servicing asset. The servicing asset is amortized in proportion to, and over, the period of net servicing income or loss. On a quarterly basis, servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on their fair value. Mortgage servicing income of $126,000 for 2018 and $114,000 for 2017 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income, excluding mortgage servicing income, was $492,000 for 2018, an increase of $164,000 from the amount recorded in 2017. Other non-interest income for 2018 included $48,000 in broker-dealer conversion costs reimbursement and a $57,000 sales tax refund. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, and check sale commissions of $55,000, $15,000, and $18,000, respectively, were partially offset by a reduction in title company income of $10,000, when comparing 2018 to 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal non-interest income was $6,887,000 in 2017 compared with $5,667,000 in 2016, an increase of $1,220,000. Excluding the loss on sale of indirect finance leasing portfolio of $223,000 in 2016, the increase in non-interest income was $997,000, comparing 2017 to 2016.\nFees for services to customers were $1,668,000 for 2017, an increase of $47,000, or 2.9%, from 2016. Overdraft income increased by $44,000, or 3.6%, when comparing 2017 to 2016. ATM and debit card income was $1,749,000 in 2017, an increase of $98,000, or 5.9%, from the amount recorded in 2016. Debit card interchange income increased $103,000, or 6.5%, to $1,694,000 in 2017, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $5,000, to $55,000.\n- 30 -\nRetail brokerage and advisory revenue was $436,000 for 2017 compared with $603,000 in 2016, a decline of $167,000, or 27.7%. There were less sales in front-loaded products in 2017 than in 2016, resulting in a $260,000 reduction of revenues. In 2017 there was a transition to move toward advanced advisory fees based on assets under management in lieu of fees per transaction; advisory fees increased $106,000 comparing 2017 to 2016.\nIncome on BOLI policies during 2017 was $345,000, including a death benefit of $52,000, compared to $308,000 for 2016. Merchant income was $345,000 for 2017, an increase of $11,000, or 3.3%, from the amount reported in 2016.\nNet gains on investment securities increased $826,000 to $1,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $674,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in greater opportunities for profitable sales in 2017 compared with 2016. The prolonged decline in market value of one equity security in 2017 and two equity securities in 2016 resulted in recording other than temporary impairment charges of $80,000 and $192,000, respectively. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $1,477,000 and $566,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $23,000 and $108,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Both the 2017 and 2016 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the next two years. In June 2017, QNB Bank sold five non-performing pooled trust preferred securities ( PreTSL\u201d), with a $2,235,000 carrying value, recording a loss on sale of $15,000, included in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Several years ago, QNB had recorded $1,152,000 in OTTI for four of these five PreTSLs, and subsequently applied any cashflow received to the balance of these non-performing, nonaccrual assets. Improvement in market prices for these PreTSLs during the second quarter 2017 reduced realized losses, and the reduction of approximately $19,000,000 in risk-based assets required for these bonds drove the decision to redeem these debt securities.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio; the net realized gains recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $27,000. The net realized and unrealized losses recorded at December 31, 2016 were $40,000 and fair value was $3,596,000. Unrealized gains on trading activity related to trading securities held at December 31, 2016 totaled $69,000.\nIn October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts and recorded a loss of $223,000.\nThe net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $276,000 and $320,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $9,041,000 and $9,204,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2017 and 2016 are $66,000 and $69,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets. The remaining $99,000 gain on sale of loans in 2017 is attributed to QNB's portion of a purchased participation loan with no carrying balance that was sold. Mortgage servicing income of $114,000 for 2017 and $125,000 for 2016 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income was $328,000 for 2017, an increase of $34,000 from the amount recorded in 2016. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, check sale commissions, and merchant loss recoveries of $50,000, $8,000, $7,000, and $6,000, respectively, were partially offset by a reduction in sales tax refunds of $36,000, when comparing 2017 to 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> Non-interest expense comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy, furniture and equipment, marketing, third party services, FDIC insurance premiums, regulatory assessments and taxes and various other operating expenses. Total non-interest expense was $25,885,000 in 2018, an increase of $2,165,000, or 9.1%, from the $23,720,000 recorded in 2017. QNB's overhead efficiency ratio, which represents the percentage of each dollar of revenue that is used for non-interest expense, is calculated by taking non-interest expense divided by net operating revenue (tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income). QNB's efficiency ratios for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 63.6%, 58.0%, and 61.9%, respectively. The increase in the 2018 efficiency ratio is primarily due to security net gains in 2017 of $1,500,000 versus net losses in 2018 of $412,000 and partially due to tax rate changes under the 2017 Tax Reform Act impacting the tax-equivalence of interest income.\nSalaries and benefits expense is the largest component of non-interest expense. QNB monitors, using various surveys, the competitive salary and benefit information in its markets and makes adjustments when appropriate. Salaries and benefits expense for 2018 was $14,411,000, an increase of $1,290,000 compared with $13,121,000 reported in 2017. Salary expense for 2018 was $11,444,000, an increase of $848,000 compared with $10,596,000 reported in 2017. Included in salary expense in 2018 was incentive compensation plus related payroll taxes of $910,000, a $293,000 increase over incentive compensation in 2017. Benefit expense for 2018 was $2,967,000, an increase of $442,000, or 17.5%, from the amount recorded in 2017 with payroll taxes increasing $13,000 as salary expense increased. Medical premiums increased $336,000. Retirement plan matching and safe harbor increased $75,000 compared to 2017. QNB utilized unvested forfeited 401(k) contributions to offset retirement plan matching in 2018 and 2017.\nNet occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased $389,000, to $4,037,000 when comparing 2018 to 2017, due primarily to increased software, higher depreciation resulting from 2018 renovations and a branch relocation, building and equipment maintenance and branch rent.\nMarketing expense was $927,000 for 2018, a $13,000 increase from the expense recorded in 2017. Marketing expenses related to public relations increased $23,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 2017. QNB's contributions and sponsorships for not-for-profit organizations, events and clubs in the communities it serves are included in public relations expense.\nThird party services are comprised of professional services, including legal, accounting, auditing and consulting services, as well as fees paid to outside vendors for support services of day-to-day operations. These support services include correspondent banking services, statement printing and mailing, investment security safekeeping and supply management services. Third party services increased $281,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to increased legal services of $62,000, information technology third party services of $69,000, tax preparation fees of $36,000 related to method changes implemented for the 2017 returns, and other third-party services.\nTelephone, postage and supplies expense decreased $119,000, or 14.8%, to $685,000 in 2018, compared with 2017. Supplies expense decreased $21,000 in 2018, as additional supplies related to EMV chip debit card production were purchased in 2017. Telecommunications expense decreased $74,000 due cost savings related to the consolidation of services. Postage expense decreased $24,000; additional expense was incurred in 2017 due to the issuance to EMV chip debit cards.\nFDIC insurance premium expense increased $47,000, or 8.1%, in 2018. The premium assessment formula for small institutions was changed by the FDIC and implemented in late 2016 and is based on asset growth and related risk assumptions determined by the FDIC as well as capital. Small institutions, for FDIC premium assessments purposes, are defined as those with total consolidated assets less than $10 billion. On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36%. Because the reserve ratio has exceeded 1.35%, a change impacting QNB's deposit insurance assessment occurred under the FDIC regulations: Small institutions were awarded assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. On January 24, 2019, QNB was notified by the FDIC that its preliminary estimated credit was approximately $234,000, which would be recognized in future periods.\nState tax expense represents the payment of the Pennsylvania Shares Tax and Pennsylvania sales and use tax. State tax expense was $727,000 and $687,000 for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $3,000 of the expense in this category. The increase in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of growth of the Bank's capital.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $224,000, or 9.5%, primarily due to check card expense, employee training and business development costs.\n- 32 -\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal non-interest expense was $23,720,000 in 2017, an increase of $1,557,000, or 7.0%, from the $22,163,000 recorded in 2016. Salaries and benefits expense for 2017 was $13,121,000, an increase of $1,110,000 compared with $12,011,000 reported in 2016. Salary expense for 2017 was $10,596,000, an increase of $1,078,000 compared with $9,518,000 reported in 2016. Included in salary expense in 2017 was incentive compensation plus related payroll taxes of $617,000, a $418,000 increase over incentive compensation in 2016. Benefit expense for 2017 was $2,525,000, an increase of $32,000, or 1.3%, from the amount recorded in 2016 with payroll taxes increasing $52,000 as salary expense increased. Retirement plan matching and safe harbor increased $56,000 compared to 2016; QNB utilized unvested forfeited 401(k) contributions to offset retirement plan matching in 2017. Post-retirement life insurance expense decreased $71,000 due to a death claim which reduced the post-retirement liability.\nNet occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased $145,000, to $3,648,000 when comparing 2017 to 2016, due primarily to increased software, building and equipment maintenance and branch rent, offset in part by lower depreciation.\nMarketing expense was $914,000 for 2017, a $108,000 increase from the expense recorded in 2016. Marketing expenses related to public relations increased $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016. QNB contributions and sponsorships for not-for-profit organizations, events and clubs in the communities it serves is included in public relations expense.\nThird party services decreased $83,000 when comparing the two periods, due to decreased legal services and other third-party services.\nTelephone, postage and supplies expense increased $52,000, or 6.9%, to $804,000 in 2017, compared with 2016. Supplies expense decreased $11,000 in 2017, as additional supplies related to EMV chip debit card production, anticipated throughout 2017, were purchased in 2016. Telecommunications expense increased $41,000 due increased data line capacity. Postage expense increased $22,000.\nFDIC insurance premium expense increased $9,000, or 1.6%, in 2017, due to a change in the premium assessment formula announced by the FDIC in 2016, establishing reduced premium assessment formulas for small institutions.\nState tax expense was $687,000 and $666,000 for the years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $2,000 of the expense in this category. The increase in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of growth of the Bank's capital.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $195,000, or 9.0%, primarily due to check card expense, offset in part by a reduction in foreclosure expense.\nIncome Taxes\nApplicable income tax expense and effective tax rates were $1,557,000, or 12.1%, for 2018 compared with $5,900,000, or 41.6%, for 2017. Under the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21%; therefore, QNB recorded a charge reflecting the revaluation of its net deferred tax assets from 34% to 21% at December 31, 2017 resulting in additional tax expense of $2,054,000. In 2018, QNB elected to change its tax methods for bad debt conformity and for loan originations costs effective with the filing of the 2017 tax return which resulted in a tax benefit of $415,000. These discrete tax items were recorded in 2018.\n- 33 -\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> Summary Impact of 2017 Tax Reform Act and Discrete Tax Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted net income excluding impact\nof discrete items and tax legislation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax provision, discrete items and revaluation of\nnet deferred tax asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,054\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported Net Income (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding impact\nof discrete items and tax legislation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of discrete items and tax legislation on\ndiluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported Diluted Earnings per Share (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the event of disclosure or release of non-GAAP financial measures, the SEC Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate excluding the discrete items was 15.3% primarily due to the decrease in the tax rate from 34% to 21%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate excluding the Tax Reform charge was 27.1%. The higher effective tax rate year over year is predominately a result of tax-exempt income from loans and securities comprising a smaller proportional share of pre-tax income than the prior year and greater state tax expense. QNB expects the effective tax rate in 2019 to be similar to the 15.3%, less than the 21% corporate rate, due to its holdings of tax-free assets, including municipal bonds, municipal loans, and life insurance contracts.

With the Federal funds rate between 1.50% and 2.50%, excess funds for liquidity purposes are kept at the Federal Reserve, which was paying 1.50% until the Federal Open Market Committee raised the targeted Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points four times in 2018 in mid-March 2018, mid-June 2018, mid-September 2018 and in mid-December 2018. These funds carry a 0% risk weighting for risk-based capital calculation purposes.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> Investment Portfolio History\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trading Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Securities Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises (GSEs):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pooled trust preferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 344,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 374,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 381,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 353,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 394,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, approximately 76% of QNB's investment securities were either U.S. Government agency debt securities, U.S. Government agency issued mortgage-backed securities or CMOs. As of December 31, 2018, QNB held no securities of any one issue or any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government and its agencies) that were in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity.\nThe QNB investment portfolio represents a significant portion of earning assets and interest income. QNB actively manages the investment portfolio in an attempt to maximize earnings, while considering liquidity needs, interest rate risk and credit risk. The decrease of the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets in 2018 is due to loan growth. Proceeds from the sale of investments were $9,061,000 in 2018 compared with $42,509,000 during 2017.\nIn addition to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities, proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments of securities were $48,074,000 in 2018 compared with $52,994,000 in 2017. During 2018, $36,236,000 of investment securities were purchased compared with $85,265,000 during 2017.\nThe balance of U.S. Government agency securities decreased $2,115,000 to $68,409,000 at December 31, 2018 and represents 19.3% of the investment portfolio compared with 18.6% at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of two securities. U.S. Government agency issued CMO and MBS balances decreased $17,601,000 to $201,404,000 and represents 57.0% of the portfolio compared with 57.7% at December 31, 2017. These bonds provide monthly cash flow to be reinvested in either loans or other securities, potentially at higher yields as rates increase.\nThe balance of municipal securities decreased $10,491,000 to $66,313,000 at December 31, 2018, representing 18.8% of the investment portfolio compared with 20.2% at December 31, 2017. QNB focuses on the financial performance of the underlying issuer for municipal bond purchases in addition to the bond rating of the issuer or the rating of bond insurer, if present. Nineteen bonds with a book value of $8,150,000 were called or matured in 2018 and three bonds were sold for $1,964,000. The demand for tax-exempt municipal securities has declined as the tax-equivalent yield is becoming less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics.\n- 35 -\nQNB owns one collateralized debt obligations ( CDO\u201d) in the form of a pooled trust preferred security. The security is mainly comprised of securities issued by banks or bank holding companies. QNB owns the mezzanine tranche of this security. The security is structured so that the senior and mezzanine tranches are protected from defaults by over-collateralization and cash flow default protection provided by subordinated tranches. The trust preferred security the Bank continues to hold has a carrying balance of $116,000 at December 31, 2018 and represents the senior-most obligation of the trust. There was no credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charge during 2018, 2017 or 2016. Future estimates of fair value of the remaining security could require recording additional OTTI charges through earnings. For additional detail on these securities see Notes 4 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity securities increased $4,446,000 to $9,421,000 at December 31, 2018 from $4,975,000 at December 31, 2017. QNB sold $4,902,000 in equity securities for a net loss of $79,000; QNB purchased $9,763,000 in equities during 2018.\nQNB accounts for its investments by classifying securities into four categories. Debt securities that QNB has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.\nInvestment Portfolio Maturities and Weighted Average Yields\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> December 31,

are based on anticipated payment periods and state and municipal securities which are based on pre-refunded date, if applicable. Tax-exempt securities were adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis and are based on the marginal Federal corporate tax rate of 21% and a Tax Equity and Financial Responsibility Act ( TEFRA\u201d) adjustment for the cost of funds. Weighted average yields on investment securities available-for-sale are based on amortized cost.\n- 36 -\nInvestment Securities - Trading\nIn 2014, QNB established a small percentage of its investment portfolio as trading in an effort to boost yields and income. During the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio, as lack of market volatility and the interest rate environment resulted in declining performance of the portfolio, since its inception in 2014. QNB recorded a net gain of $27,000 for 2017 in non-interest income.\nInvestments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities include securities that management intends to use as part of its liquidity and asset/liability management strategy. These securities may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the securities prepayment or credit risk, the need for liquidity, or growth in loan demand. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of investment debt securities available-for-sale was $344,221,000, or $9,028,000 below the amortized cost of $353,249,000. This compares to a fair value of $374,570,000, or $5,870,000 below the amortized cost of $380,440,000, at December 31, 2017. The available-for-sale portfolio, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, had a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.8 years at December 31, 2018 and 4.3 years at December 31, 2017. The weighted average tax-equivalent yield, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, was 2.38% and 2.36% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe weighted average maturity is based on the stated contractual maturity or likely call date of all securities except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on estimated average life. The maturity of the portfolio could become shorter if interest rates declined and prepayments on MBS and CMOs increased or securities are called. However, the estimated average life could lengthen if interest rates were to increase and principal payments on MBS and CMOs slowed or securities anticipated to be called extend past their call date.\nInvestments Held-To-Maturity Debt Securities\nQNB did not hold any held-to-maturity security during 2018 or 2017.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nQNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. This ASU was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on January 5, 2016 to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The FASB issued ASU 2018-03 in February 2018 which provides technical corrections and improvements to ASU 2016-01. QNB used the modified retrospective method for transition in which the cumulative effect will be recognized at the date of adoption with no restatement of comparative periods presented. QNB reclassified a loss, net of taxes, of $254,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of the equity securities was $4,975,000, or $321,000 below the cost of $5,296,000. Increases and decreases in the fair value were recognized in net income during 2018. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of the equity securities was $9,421,000, or $658,000 below the cost of $10,079,000.\nLoans\nQNB's primary business is to accept deposits and to make loans to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves. Loans are the most significant component of earning assets, and growth in loans to small businesses and residents of these communities has been a primary focus of QNB. Inherent within the lending function is the evaluation and acceptance of credit risk and interest rate risk. QNB manages credit risk associated with its lending activities through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices.\nQNB has comprehensive policies and procedures that define and govern commercial and retail loan originations and the management of risk. All loans are underwritten in a manner that emphasizes the borrowers' capacity to pay. The measurement of capacity to pay delineates the potential risk of non-payment or default. The higher potential for default determines the need for and amount of collateral required. QNB makes unsecured commercial loans when the capacity to pay is considered substantial. As capacity lessens, collateral is required to provide a secondary source of repayment and to mitigate the risk of loss. Various policies and procedures provide guidance to the lenders on such factors as amount, terms, price, maturity and appropriate collateral levels. Each risk factor is considered critical to ensuring that QNB receives an adequate return for the risk undertaken, and that the risk of loss is minimized.\nQNB manages the risk associated with commercial loans by having lenders work in tandem with credit analysts while maintaining independence between personnel. In addition, a Bank loan committee and a committee of the Board of Directors review and approve certain loan requests on a weekly basis. Other than disclosed in the forthcoming Loan Portfolio Table, at December 31, 2018, there was a concentration of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings of 15.8% of total loans and to lessors of nonresidential buildings of 18.1% of total loans, compared with 15.7% and of 17.3% of total loans, respectively, at December 31, 2017. These concentrations were primarily within the commercial real estate categories.\n- 37 -\nQNB moved from an eight-grade risk rating system to a ten-grade system in 2018, further disaggregating the credit quality of the loan portfolio to enhance credit risk strategies.\nQNB's commercial lending activity is focused on small businesses within the local community. Commercial purpose loans are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay these loans depends on the successful operation of the borrower's business. The assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these types of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, to cash. Commercial and industrial loans represent commercial purpose loans that are either secured by collateral other than real estate or unsecured.\nCommercial loans secured by commercial real estate include commercial purpose loans collateralized at least in part by commercial real estate. Some of these loans may not be for the express purpose of conducting commercial real estate transactions. Commercial loans secured by residential real estate are commercial purpose loans generally secured by the business owner's residence or residential investment properties owned by the borrower and rented to tenants. Commercial loans secured by either commercial real estate or residential real estate are originated primarily within the Eastern Pennsylvania market area, are within the Bank's underwriting criteria, and generally include the guarantee of the borrowers. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions are tax-exempt or taxable loans to municipalities, school districts and housing and industrial development authorities. These loans can be general obligations of the municipality or school district repaid through their taxing authority, revenue obligations repaid through the income generated by the operations of the authority, such as a water or sewer authority, or loans issued to a housing and industrial development agency, for which a private corporation is responsible for payments on the loans.\nThe Company originates fixed rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. To reduce interest rate risk, qualifying originations of fixed-rate loans to individuals for 1-4 family residential mortgages with maturities of 15 years or greater are generally sold in the secondary market. Mortgage loan origination activity declined in 2018 with $4,373,000 in residential mortgages originated for sale during 2018, compared with $7,976,000 for 2017. There were no residential mortgage loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nThe home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. These loans are often in a junior lien position and therefore carry a higher risk than first lien 1-4 family residential loans. Risks associated with loans secured by residential properties, either first lien residential mortgages or home equity loans and lines, are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market. Since most loans are secured by a primary or secondary residence, the borrower's continued employment is the greatest risk to repayment.\nThe Company offers a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than loans secured by residential real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess or more likely to decrease in value than real estate. Credit risk in this portfolio is controlled by conservative underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower, and, if secured, the value of the collateral.\nTotal loan receivables at December 31, 2018 were $785,448,000, an increase of $52,165,000, or 7.1%, from December 31, 2017. This follows a 15.8% increase in outstanding loans in 2017. A key financial ratio, loans to deposits, improved slightly to 77.3% at December 31, 2018, compared with 73.8% at December 31, 2017. QNB continues to be committed to make loans available to credit worthy consumers and businesses.\n- 38 -\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> Loan Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Table details final maturity.\nThe following shows the amount of loans due after one year that have fixed interest rates and variable or adjustable interest rates at December 31, 2018:\nLoans with fixed predetermined interest rates: $97,309,000\nLoans with variable or adjustable interest rates: $546,702,000\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation table on Page 42 shows the percentage composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years. There was very little change in the composition of the portfolio between the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Loans secured by commercial real estate represent the largest sector of the portfolio, increasing slightly from 39.1% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 39.3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018, as the balances in this sector grew by $21,723,000, or 7.6%, from $286,867,000 at December 31, 2017 to $308,590,000 at December 31, 2018. While loans secured by commercial real estate represent a significant portion of the total portfolio, the collateral is diversified, including investment properties, manufacturing facilities, office buildings, hospitals, retirement and nursing home facilities, warehouses and owner-occupied facilities. Commercial real estate loans have drawn the attention of the regulators in recent years as a potential source of risk. QNB monitors these types of loans closely, obtaining updated appraisals on loans classified substandard or worse. As detailed in the Allowance for Loan Losses table, QNB had no charge-offs in this category in 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nCommercial loans secured by residential real estate decreased by $3,122,000, or 4.4%, to $68,581,000 at December 31, 2018 and at 8.7% represent a slightly smaller share of the overall portfolio than the 9.8% at December 31, 2017. Some of the properties that serve as collateral for these loans are located outside the Bank's market area and have experienced vacancies and significant declines in market value. Charge-offs in this category have significantly decreased over the past three years. Non-accrual commercial loans secured by residential real estate were $1,102,000, $1,458,000, and $1,866,000 at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and loan charge-offs were $77,000, $23,000, and $120,000, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, approximately $77,000 of the charge-offs were out-of-market investment properties, compared with all of the $23,000 in charge-offs in 2017 and approximately $96,000 of the $120,000 charge-offs in 2016.\n- 39 -\nCommercial and industrial loans, the second largest sector of the portfolio, experienced growth in balances of $15,262,000, or 10.4%, to $162,452,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed a growth in this category of $36,957,000, or 33.5%, in 2017. Commercial and industrial loans represented 20.7% of the portfolio at year-end 2018 compared with 20.1% at December 31, 2017. This category of loans generally presents a greater risk than loans secured by real estate since these loans are either secured by accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, or are unsecured. During 2017, nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan balances decreased $1,431,000 to $3,367,000, the majority of which is due to the partial charge-off of one credit of $896,000 which was downgraded in 2017. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, charge-offs were $0, $960,000, and $140,000, respectively.\nConstruction loans decreased 2.0% from $51,157,000, or 7.0% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017, to $50,135,000, or 6.4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018. These loans are primarily to developers and builders for the construction of residential units or commercial buildings or to businesses for the construction of owner-occupied facilities. This portfolio is diversified among different types of collateral including: 1-4 family residential construction, medical and retirement home facilities, office buildings, hotels and land for development loans. Construction loans are generally made only on projects that have municipal approval. These loans are usually originated to include a short construction period followed by permanent financing provided through a commercial mortgage after construction is complete. Once construction is complete, the balance is moved to the secured by commercial real estate category if the permanent financing is provided by the Bank. There were no charge-offs in the construction loan portfolio since 2011, and no construction loans on non-accrual since 2014.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions increased $5,650,000, or 14.8%, from $38,087,000 at December 31, 2017 to $43,737,000 at December 31, 2018. This sector increased from 5.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 5.6% at December 31, 2018. Many municipalities, counties and school districts refinanced their existing bonds or bank debt and, as a result, QNB had an opportunity to successfully bid on many of these local issues. The increase in 2018 was due to some of the commitments for large projects won during 2016 that started to fund during the first quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act made the tax effective yield on loans to state and political subdivisions less favorable than experienced historically.\nResidential mortgage loans secured by first lien balances increased by $11,635,000, or 20.8%, to $67,453,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed an increase of $8,694,000, or 18.4%, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. In 2018 and 2017, QNB retained some adjustable and fixed rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios.\nBalances in home equity loans and lines increased $1,899,000, or 2.5%, to $77,475,000 at December 31, 2018. During 2018, QNB continued to offer very attractive rates on both variable and fixed rate home equity loans and lines. These attractive rates, along with excellent customer service, including quick turnaround time, contributed to the growth in home equity balances. With continued improvement in home values as well as the local economy, it is expected that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nConsumer loan balances increased $105,000 to $6,785,000 at December 31, 2018. In 2013, QNB reentered the private student loan market through a relationship with iHelp. These student loans are either fixed or variable rate with the rate dependent on the credit scores of the student and/or the cosigner. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of student loans was $3,822,000, an increase of $86,000 compared with December 31, 2017. Student loan balances will decline, as their balances are no longer insured, and QNB ceased funding originations through iHelp.\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans, OREO and repossessed assets and non-performing trust preferred securities. Non-performing assets totaled $9,638,000, or 0.82% of total assets at December 31, 2018, a $396,000 increase over the $9,242,000, or 0.80% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Included in non-performing assets in 2016 is $2,281,000, of pooled trust preferred securities. In June 2017, QNB Bank sold five non-performing pooled trust preferred securities with a $2,235,000 carrying value. The Bank's remaining trust preferred security was returned to accruing status in June 2017.\nTotal non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and troubled debt restructured loans were $9,638,000, or 1.23% of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared with $9,242,000, or 1.26% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Loans on non-accrual status were $7,478,000 at December 31, 2018 compared with $7,921,000 at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns of $1,683,000, charge-offs of $118,000, and loans returned to accruing status of $1,237,000, of which $1,045,000 were performing under troubled debt restructurings; this was partially offset by $2,595,000 being placed on nonaccrual of which $1,747,000 was one commercial relationship. In cases where there is a collateral shortfall on non-accrual loans, specific impairment reserves have been established based on updated collateral values even if the borrower continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Of the total amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018, $3,072,000, or approximately 41% of the loans classified as non-accrual, are current or past due less than 30 days.\n- 40 -\nQNB had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2018 or at December 31, 2017. Total loans that are 30 days or more past due increased $1,722,000 to $5,941,000, representing 0.76% of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared with 0.58% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Restructured loans, as defined in accounting guidance for troubled debt restructuring in ASC 310-40, that have not already been included in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing or in non-accrual loans, totaled $2,160,000 and $1,321,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nQNB held no OREO at December 31, 2018 or 2017. There were no repossessed assets as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> Non-Performing Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management's view is that loans classified as substandard or doubtful that are not included in the past due, non-accrual or restructured categories are potential problem loans. For some of these loans, management may have knowledge of possible credit problems that will cause management to question the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Commercial loans classified as substandard or doubtful, which includes non-performing loans, continue to show improvement. At December 31, 2018, substandard or doubtful loans totaled $18,339,000, an increase of $1,692,000, or 10.2%, from the $16,647,000, reported as of December 31, 2017.\n- 41 -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The determination of an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an analysis of the risks inherent in QNB's loan portfolio. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, makes significant estimates and assumptions. Since the allowance for loan losses is dependent on conditions that may be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for losses on loans. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance.\nManagement closely monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and performs a quarterly analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the level of unallocated reserves. This analysis considers a number of relevant factors including: specific impairment reserves, historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions, levels of and trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, levels of classified loans, trends in the growth rate of loans and concentrations of credit.\nEconomic conditions, nationally and in QNB's market, continued to improve in 2018, and asset quality remained strong. The allowance level stated as a percent of loans receivable increased from 1.07% at December 31, 2017 to 1.12% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses increased to $8,834,000 at year-end 2018 from $7,841,000 at year-end 2017, primarily due to the increase in loans receivable over the same period.\nTable 83: <table> <tr>

Percent gross loans lists the percentage of each loan type to total loans.\nA loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that QNB will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls may not be classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been identified totaled $16,482,000 and $13,584,000, respectively, of which $11,763,000 and $11,125,000, respectively, required no specific allowance for loan loss. The recorded investment in impaired loans requiring an allowance for loan losses was $4,719,000 and $2,459,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related allowance for loan losses associated with these loans was $1,664,000 and $1,392,000, respectively. See Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional detail of impaired loans.\n- 42 -\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> Allowance for Loan

loan charge-offs of $137,000, or 0.02% of average loans for 2018 compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of average loans for 2017 and $190,000, or 0.03% of average loans for 2016. The majority of charge-offs recorded during these periods had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loan. The increase in commercial and industrial charge-offs in 2017 is primarily related to a single credit.\n- 43 -\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses of $8,834,000 is adequate as of December 31, 2018, in relation to the estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio.\nPremises and equipment\nPremises and equipment, net of depreciation increased $1,423,000 to $9,918,000 at December 31, 2018, Building improvement and other purchases more than offset depreciation during 2018.\nOther assets\nOther assets, as presented in the table on Page 34, increased $395,000 from $6,584,000 at December 31, 2017 to $6,979,000 at December 31, 2018. Most of the increase in other assets relates to a $405,000 increase to the deferred tax asset resulting from the fair value adjustment on investment securities available-for-sale of $641,000 partially offset by the deferred tax liability on deferred loan costs of $361,000. The detail of the net deferred tax asset can be found in Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIABILITIES\nThe following table presents total liabilities at the dates indicated:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,015,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 993,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,884\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,071,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,053,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nQNB primarily attracts deposits from within its market area by offering various deposit products. These deposits are in the form of time deposits, which include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts ( IRA\u201ds) which have a stated maturity, and non-maturity deposit accounts, which include: non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts.\nTotal deposits increased $21,650,000, or 2.2%, to $1,015,598,000 at December 31, 2018. This follows an increase of $80,593,000, or 8.8%, between 2016 and 2017. QNB has experienced growth in part due to market disruption created by bank mergers in its footprint throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. The growth in deposits as well as the mix of deposits continues to be impacted by customers' reactions to the competition, regulations and the interest rate environment. Many customers are looking for transaction accounts that provide liquidity and pay a reasonable amount of interest. Time deposit balances declined slightly. Customers appear to be looking for the safety of FDIC insured deposits and the stability of a strong local community bank.\nNon-interest-bearing demand accounts decreased slightly by $597,000 to $128,615,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed growth of $10,202,000, or 8.6%, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. These deposits are primarily comprised of business checking accounts and are volatile depending on the timing of deposits and withdrawals. QNB has been successful in attracting new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers, which provides an opportunity for fee income.\nInterest-bearing demand accounts, retail and business interest checking and municipal accounts increased $7,182,000, or 2.4%, to $304,652,000 at December 31, 2018. All segments experienced growth in 2018 except municipal accounts, which decreased $24,463,000. While QNB has been successful in developing relationships with several school districts and municipalities as well as expanding existing relationships, the balances in these accounts are seasonal in nature and can be volatile on a daily basis. Most of the school district taxes are collected during the third quarter of the year and are disbursed over a nine-month period. Business checking increased from $19,937,000 at December 31, 2017 to $41,991,000 at December 31, 2018. Rewards checking balances increased from $55,071,000 at December 31, 2017 to $57,621,000 at December 31, 2018, and Select 50 balances increased from $81,877,000 to $87,598,000 over this same period. Personal interest-bearing balances also increased from $22,421,000 at December 31, 2017 to $23,741,000 at December 31, 2018. QNB continues to open a significant number of new checking accounts.\nMoney Market accounts decreased from $84,562,000 at December 31, 2017 to $78,781,000 at December 31, 2018 due to decreases in both personal and business accounts.\n- 44 -\nTotal savings account balances increased $22,240,000, or 8.6%, to $279,762,000 at December 31, 2018. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the online eSavings account of $22,797,000, or 12.2%, to $208,993,000 at December 31, 2018. The rate on eSavings accounts was changed from 0.65% at the end of 2017 to 0.70% in March 2018, 0.75% in June 2018, 0.80% in September 2018 and to 0.85% in December 2018.\nTotal time deposit account balances were $223,788,000 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,394,000, or 0.6%, from the amount reported at December 31, 2017. As time deposits matured during the past two years, they were frequently reinvested in the high yielding and liquid Rewards or Select 50 checking, money market or eSavings accounts which, in many instances, paid a rate higher than what was offered on short-term time deposits.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> Maturity of Time Deposits of $100,000 or More\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo continue to attract and retain deposits, QNB plans to remain competitive with respect to rates and to continue to deliver products with terms and features that appeal to customers.

Overnight FHLB borrowings declined $10,046,000, to $3,865,000 at December 31, 2018. Commercial sweeps increased $5,162,000, or 12.3%, to $47,007,000 at December 31, 2018.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities comprise accrued expenses including salaries, post-retirement life insurance benefits and income taxes, deferred revenue, and ATM/debit card processing clearing. This category increased $506,000 to $4,185,000 at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity represents an institution's ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. QNB attempts to manage its mix of cash and interest-bearing balances, Federal funds sold and investment securities to match the volatility, seasonality, interest sensitivity and growth trends of its loans and deposits. The Company manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. Liquidity is provided from asset sources through repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities. The portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale and QNB's policy of selling certain residential mortgage originations in the secondary market also provide sources of liquidity. Core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding source for QNB. These deposits and repurchase agreements are generated from a base of consumers, businesses and public funds primarily located in the Company's market area.\n- 45 -\nAn additional source of liquidity is provided by the Bank's membership in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $311,119,000, net of the $3,865,000 outstanding at year-end 2018 and $350,000 FHLB-issued letter of credit. The maximum borrowing capacity changes depending upon the Bank's level of qualifying collateral assets. QNB had $3,865,000 and $13,911,000 in FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Bank maintains four unsecured Federal funds lines with four correspondent banks totaling $46,000,000. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines. Future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn. As part of its contingency funding plan, QNB successfully tested its ability to borrow from these sources during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, equity and available-for-sale securities and loans held-for-sale totaled $367,100,000 at December 31, 2018 and $395,876,000 at December 31, 2017, of which $194,573,000 and $202,887,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and public deposits. This decrease in liquid sources is primarily the result of a $30,349,000 decrease in available-for-sale securities. Management anticipates that these liquid sources are adequate to meet normal fluctuations in loan demand or deposit withdrawals. It is anticipated that the investment portfolio will continue to provide sufficient liquidity as municipal bonds are called and as principal and interest payments on mortgage-backed and CMO securities provide steady cash flow. Increases in interest rates, however, result in decreased cash flow available from the investment portfolio.\nQNB is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services ( CDARS\u201d) program offered by the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. It enables financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on time deposits over $250,000 that are placed in the program. QNB also has available Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d), another program through Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC, which is a product similar to CDARS, but one that provides liquidity like a money market or savings account. QNB had $151,000 in CDARS time deposits at December 31, 2018.\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe following table presents total shareholders' equity at the dates indicated:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surplus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retained earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net\nof tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,046\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $5,778,000, or 5.9%, to $104,348,000 at December 31, 2018 with retained earnings -- net income less dividends paid -- contributing $6,901,000 and the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan contributing $1,372,000.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $3,046,000; $2,495,000, resulting from the decrease in fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio due to increased interest rates at the end of 2018. QNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 202), in the first quarter of 2018 as discussed in Note 1. The implementation of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-02 resulted in reclasses within Shareholders Equity from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax\u201d to Retained earnings\u201d of a $254,000 net loss and a $805,000 net gain, respectively.\nQNB remains well capitalized\u201d based on FDIC requirements.\nCapital Adequacy\nA strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and profitability and to serve the needs of depositors. QNB's shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 was $104,348,000, or 8.88% of total assets, compared with shareholders' equity of $98,570,000, or 8.55% of total assets, at December 31, 2017. Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 included a negative adjustment of $7,132,000 related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available for sale. At December 31, 2017, shareholders' equity included a negative adjustment of $4,086,000, related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available-for-sale. Excluding these adjustments, shareholders' equity to total assets would have been 9.43% and 8.88% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n- 46 -\nAverage shareholders' equity and average total assets were $108,241,000 and $1,176,910,000 for 2018, an increase of 6.7% and 5.4%, respectively, from 2017 average equity and average total assets of $101,496,000 and $1,117,163,000, respectively. The ratio of average total equity to total average assets was 9.20% for 2018, compared with 9.09% for 2017.\nQNB is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to its shareholders pursuant to the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 as amended (the BCL). The BCL operates generally to preclude dividend payments, if the effect thereof would render QNB insolvent, as defined. As a practical matter, QNB's payment of dividends is contingent upon its ability to obtain funding in the form of dividends from the Bank. Under Pennsylvania banking law, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2018, the retained earnings of the Bank totaling $99,009,000 was available for dividends without prior Pennsylvania Department of Banking approval, subject to the regulatory capital requirements discussed below. The approval of the Federal Reserve is required for a state bank member in the Federal Reserve system to pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the Bank's net profits (as defined) for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the Bank can declare dividends in 2019 without approval of the Federal Reserve of approximately $17,365,000 plus an additional amount equal to the Bank's net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. QNB paid dividends to its shareholders of $1.28 per share, $1.24 per share, and $1.20 per share, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nQNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various weights to all assets and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and loan commitments, based on associated risk. QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III\u201d) became effective for QNB on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all the of final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nUnder the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banks. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented. The final rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. QNB and the Bank have enough capital to meet the buffer if it were fully phased in at December 31, 2018.\nQNB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan\u201d) to provide participants a convenient and economical method for investing cash dividends paid on the Company's common stock in additional shares at a discount. The Plan also allows participants to make additional cash purchases of stock at a discount. Stock purchases under the Plan contributed $979,000 and $973,000 to capital during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100,000 shares of QNB's common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

QNB's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and liquidity risk. QNB's liquidity position was discussed in a prior section.\nQNB's largest source of revenue is net interest income, which is subject to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins and interest rate spreads and to provide growth in net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. QNB's Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is responsible for managing interest rate risk and for evaluating the impact of changing interest rate conditions on net interest income.\nQNB uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation considers current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates assumptions for growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when its liabilities (deposits and borrowings) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its earning assets (loans and securities). A liability sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively less net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when they decline. Based on our simulation analysis, management believes QNB's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2018 is liability sensitive. Management expects that market interest rates may gradually increase in the next 12 months, based on the economic environment and policy of the Federal Reserve.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 assuming instantaneous rate shocks, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the subsequent twelve months is projected to decrease when interest rates are higher than current rates.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> Estimated change in net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComputations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect QNB's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nQNB is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. At December 31, 2018, QNB did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\n- 49 -\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nDisclosure of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the most sensitive of these issues. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of QNB, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires QNB to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. QNB evaluates estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the determination of the valuation of other real estate owned, other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities, the determination of impairment of restricted bank stock, the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. QNB bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment\nSecurities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. For equity securities, once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the equity security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320-10 as it relates to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). This accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not, the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held to maturity debt securities, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the non-credit portion of a previous other-than-temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nQNB considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable known and inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio. The allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses. The provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered necessary by management.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on management's continual review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance is determined by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves to all other loans. The portion of the allowance that is allocated to impaired loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral. The general reserves are based on the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the loan portfolio, credit concentration trends, delinquency and loss experience, as well as other qualitative factors such as current economic trends.\nManagement emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits. Credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio. QNB's lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower's circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral. A loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of collection. Each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower's financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan. An independent loan review group tests risk assessments and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management meets monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and quarterly to review the allowance for loan losses.\n- 50 -\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. If circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, increases to the allowance may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.\nForeclosed Assets\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2018, QNB sponsored stock-based compensation plans, administered by a Board committee, under which both qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted periodically to certain employees. QNB accounts for all awards granted under stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date. QNB estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature.\nIncome Taxes\nQNB accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method in accordance with income tax accounting guidance, ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available. Because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may, at least in part, be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations - Overview\nQNB Corp. ( QNB\u201d or the Company\u201d) earns its net income primarily through its subsidiary, QNB Bank (the Bank\u201d). Net interest income, or the spread between the interest, dividends and fees earned on loans and investment securities and the expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, is the primary source of operating income for QNB. QNB seeks to achieve sustainable and consistent earnings growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk levels approved by the Board of Directors. Due to its limited geographic area, comprised principally of Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, growth is pursued through expansion of existing customer relationships and building new relationships by stressing a consistent high level of service at all points of contact.\nTabular information presented throughout management's discussion and analysis, other than share and per share data, is presented in thousands of dollars.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,335,000, or $3.25 per share on a diluted basis. This compares to 2017 net income of $8,289,000, or $2.41 per share on a diluted basis and 2016 net income of $8,924,000, or $2.63 per share on a diluted basis. Two important measures of profitability in the banking industry are an institution's return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity. Return on average assets was 0.96%, 0.74% and 0.87% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and return on average shareholders' equity was 10.47%, 8.17% and 9.45%, respectively, during those same periods.\n2018 versus 2017\nThe results for 2018 include the following significant components:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $2,593,000, or 8.0%, to $35,015,000 for 2018. \n \u2022 The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased one basis points to 3.13% for 2018 from 3.14% for 2017. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses totaled $1,130,000 for 2018, compared with $1,400,000 for 2017. \n \u2022 Non-interest income for 2018 was $4,892,000, a decrease of $1,995,000, or 29.0%, compared with 2017. Non-interest expense for 2018 was $25,885,000, an increase of $2,165,000, or 9.1%, compared with 2017. \n \u2022 Provision for income taxes included a $415,000 benefit resulting from method changes to the bad debt conformity election and for deferred loan origination costs on the 2017 returns, realizing the benefit at the higher Federal corporate tax of 34%. \n \u2022 Loans receivable grew $52,165,000, or 7.1%, from December 31, 2017. Deposits increased $21,650,000, or 2.2%, from December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Total non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, and restructured loans, were $9,638,000, or 1.23% of total loans at December 31, 2018, compared with $9,242,000, or 1.26% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Loans on non-accrual status were $7,478,000 at December 31, 2018 compared with $7,921,000 at December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for 2018 were $137,000, or 0.02% of average total loans, as compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of average total loans for 2017. \n2017 versus 2016\nThe results for 2017 include the following significant components:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $3,918,000, or 13.8%, to $32,422,000 for 2017. \n \u2022 The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis increased 11 basis points to 3.14% for 2017 from 3.03% for 2016. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses totaled $1,400,000 for 2017, compared with $30,000 for 2016. \n \u2022 Non-interest income for 2017 was $6,887,000, an increase of $1,220,000, or 21.5%, compared with 2016.

Deposits increased $80,593,000, or 8.8%, from December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Total non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, and restructured loans, were $9,242,000, or 1.26% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared with $11,938,000, or 1.89% of total loans at December 31, 2016. Loans on non-accrual status were $7,921,000 at December 31, 2017 compared with $10,119,000 at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for 2017 were $953,000, or 0.14% of average total loans, as compared with $190,000, or 0.03% of average total loans for 2016. \nThese items, as well as others, will be explained more thoroughly in the next sections.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents the adjustment to convert net interest income to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nNet interest income is the primary source of operating income for QNB. Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed). Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing deposits.\nFor purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the table that appears above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared.\nThe net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.\n2018 versus 2017\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2018 increased $1,829,000, or 5.4%, to $35,833,000. The net interest margin, which decreased slightly to 3.13% was unfavorably impacted by increased rates on deposits and borrowings and less favorable tax-equivalent yields on tax-exempt municipal investments and loans as the Federal tax rate decreased from 34% to 21%. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 18 basis points from 3.67% for 2017 to 3.85% for 2018 with the yield on loans increasing 16 basis points, favorably impacted by a $38,565,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and an 11 basis point increase in the related yield and a $26,117,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 46 basis point increase in the related yield, while the yield on investment securities declined slightly to 2.32%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points from 0.64% for 2017 to 0.88% for 2018 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.65% to 0.86% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $31,842,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.\nMarket disruption caused by local bank consolidation positively impacted both loan and deposit growth which was partially offset by the competitive local interest rate market for quality loans and deposits. Net interest spread decreased six basis points to 2.97% for 2018 compared to 3.03% for 2017. Average earning assets increased by $61,070,000, or 5.6%, to $1,143,506,000 for 2018, with average loans increasing $84,262,000, or 12.3%, to $766,744,000, while average investment securities decreased $17,699,000, or 4.5%, to $372,803,000. With the growth in earning assets occurring primarily in the loan portfolio, the mix of earning assets changed, which also contributed to relative stability of the net interest margin, as investment securities generally earn a lower yield than loans. The growth in earning assets was funded by a $40,656,000, or 4.2%, increase in average total deposits to $1,003,154,000, and the increase in average short-term borrowing, comprising sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings, of $12,267,000, or 25.2%.\n- 21 -\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law, reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This reduction in the tax rate had an impact on the tax-equivalent yield on certain interest-earning assets. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the 2017 interest margin of approximately seven basis points.\n2017 versus 2016\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2017 increased $3,859,000, or 12.8%, to $34,004,000. The net interest margin, which increased to 3.14% was favorably impacted by a $59,846,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and a 12-basis point increase in the related yield and a $17,451,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 38-basis point increase in the related yield. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 17 basis points from 3.50% for 2016 to 3.67% for 2017 with the yield on loans increasing 13 basis points while the yield on investment securities declined slightly to 2.39%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased seven basis points from 0.57% for 2016 to 0.64% for 2017 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.58% to 0.65% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $55,717,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.\n- 22 -\nAverage Balances, Rates, and Interest Income and Expense Summary (Tax-Equivalent Basis)\n\nTax-exempt securities and loans were adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis and are based on the marginal Federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent for 2018 and 34 percent for 2017 and 2016. Non-accrual loans and investment securities are included in earning assets.\n* Includes loans held-for-sale\n- 23 -\nRate-Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income (1) (2) (3)\n\n (1) Loan fees have been included in the change in interest income totals presented. Non-accrual loans and investment securities have been included in average balances. \n (2) Changes due to both volume and rates have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amount change in each. \n (3) Interest income on loans and securities is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. \nThe Rate-Volume Analysis tables, as presented on a tax-equivalent basis, highlight the impact of changing rates and volumes on interest income and interest expense. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased $4,334,000 to $44,018,000 for 2018, while total interest expense increased $2,505,000 to $8,185,000. Volume growth in earning assets contributed an additional $3,223,000 of interest income and interest rate increases contributed to additional interest income of $1,111,000. Rate-related interest expense increased $2,332,000, while volume-related interest expense increased $173,000.\nInvestments\n2018 versus 2017\nInterest income on available-for-sale and equity investment securities decreased $650,000 when comparing the two years. The decrease in average balances contributed to $400,000 of the decrease, while rates contributed the remaining $250,000 decrease. The average yield on the available-for-sale and equity investment portfolio declined slightly to 2.32% for 2018 compared to 2.38% for 2017. The decrease in the investment portfolio is due to funding needs to support loan growth.\n- 24 -\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities decreased $24,000, due to a decrease in average balances totaling $1,888,000, which was partially offset by an increase in the yield on the portfolio of one basis points from 1.78% for 2017 to 1.79% for 2018. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2018 as a result of the rising rates during the year.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities decreased $631,000. The decline in yield of 62 basis points from 3.91% in 2017 to 3.29% in 2018 contributed to a $441,000 reduction in interest income. Average balances, which decreased $4,858,000, contributed $190,000 to the interest income decline. QNB had purchased many municipal securities when rates were significantly higher. Many of these bonds have either reached maturity or their call dates and are being replaced with municipal bonds with lower yields. Typically, QNB purchased municipal bonds with 10- to 15-year maturities with call dates between 2 and 5 years. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the yield on municipal bonds of approximately 65 basis points to 3.26%. Future demand for tax-exempt municipal securities is uncertain, as the tax-equivalent yield is less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics. This portfolio is expected to continue to decline as there are $21,857,000 in municipal bonds with a 2018 tax-equivalent yield of 3.51% that are expected to be called or mature in 2019. The current yield on replacement bonds is below this threshold.\nAll the mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMO\u201d) securities owned by QNB are issued by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises ( GSE\u201d) and carry the implicit backing of the U.S. Government, but they are not direct obligations of the U.S. Government. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased $18,000 primarily due to a decrease of $10,359,000, or 4.6%, in average balances. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by nine basis points from 2.05% for 2017 to 2.14% for 2018. This portfolio generally provides higher yields relative to agency bonds and provides monthly cash flow which can be used for liquidity purposes or can be reinvested as interest rates increase.\n2017 versus 2016\nInterest income on trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity investment securities increased $691,000 when comparing the two years. The increase in average balances contributed to $613,000 of the increase, while better rates contributed the remaining $78,000 increase. The average yield on the investment portfolio declined slightly to 2.39% for 2017 compared to 2.42% for 2016. The increase in the investment portfolio is due to investment opportunities at a yield comparable to the overall portfolio yield in late 2016 compared with previous periods, as well as continuing increase in deposits.\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities increased $193,000, due to an increase in average balances totaling $12,767,000, which was offset by a decline in the yield on the portfolio of five basis points from 1.83% for 2016 to 1.78% for 2017. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2017 as a result of the rising rates during the year.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities increased $12,000. Average balances, which increased $2,785,000, contributed $113,000 to interest income. This was partially offset by a 13-basis point decline in yield from 4.04% in 2016 to 3.91% in 2017 contributing to a $101,000 reduction in interest income.\nInterest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs increased $578,000 primarily due to an increase of $21,436,000, or 10.6%, in average balances. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by seven basis points from 1.98% for 2016 to 2.05% for 2017.\nLoans\n2018 versus 2017\nThe largest category of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans. This category of loans includes commercial purpose loans secured by either commercial properties such as office buildings, hotels, factories, warehouses, medical facilities and retail establishments, or residential real estate, usually the residence of the business owner or investment properties. The category also includes construction and land development loans. Income on commercial real estate loans increased $2,226,000. The increase in average balances of $38,565,000, or 9.8%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,755,000. The 11-basis point increase in yield, from 4.55% in 2017 to 4.66% in 2018 resulted in an increase of interest income of $471,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans, the second largest category, increased $1,917,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $26,117,000, or 20.3%, to $154,958,000 for 2018, resulting in a $1,214,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 46 basis points to 5.10% providing an additional $703,000 in interest income. Many of the loans in this category are indexed to the prime interest rate, which increased by one quarter of one percent four times since December 2017.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $26,000 from 2017. When comparing the same periods, average balances increased $7,270,000 to $43,012,000, which contributed a $287,000 increase in interest income. This increase was offset by a decrease in the average yield on\n- 25 -\nthe tax-exempt loan portfolio from 3.95% for 2017 to 3.22% for 2018, resulting in a decline in interest income of $313,000. Had the 2017 Tax Reform Act been in effect in 2017, the impact would have resulted in a reduction to the yield on municipal bonds of approximately 66 basis points to 3.29%.\nQNB strives to become the local consumer lender of choice\u201d, and to affect this goal, QNB has refocused its retail lending efforts by strengthening the management of the area, adding new product offerings and by increasing marketing and promotion. The positive impact of this renewed focus has been year-over-year growth in balances in all three categories of retail lending: residential mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. Overall, interest income for retail lending increased $893,000 in 2018 compared with 2017, driven by the increase in average balances and average rate increases on home equity and consumer loans. 2017 tax reform legislation changed the tax deductibility of home equity interest for borrowers.\nIncome on home equity loans increased by $422,000 when comparing 2018 and 2017. During 2018 and 2017, QNB offered attractive rates on both variable rate and fixed rate home equity loans, which contributed to an increase in average balances totaling $798,000, or 1.2%, to $67,3762,000 when comparing 2018 and 2017. The yield on the home equity portfolio increased 58 basis points to 4.44% when comparing the two years, primarily due to prime rate increases. The demand for home equity loans has improved along with the recovery in home values. We expect that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nGiven the low yields on alternative investment securities, QNB retained certain hybrid adjustable rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios. As a result, average residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $11,070,000, or 21.6%, to $62,312,000 for 2018. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio remained fairly level at 3.86% for 2018 compared to 3.89% for 2017. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $406,000 in 2018.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $65,000. As with all other categories of retail loans, consumer loans at QNB experienced growth in average balances in 2018, which increased $442,000, or 6.7%, led by student loan growth. Growth in volume contributed $23,000 to the increase in income, and the 60-basis point increase in the average yield from 5.39% in 2017 to 5.99% in 2018 contributed to an increase in interest income of $42,000.\n2017 versus 2016\nIncome on commercial real estate loans increased $3,142,000. The increase in average balances of $59,846,000, or 17.9%, contributed an increase in interest income of $2,650,000. The 12-basis point increase in yield, from 4.43% in 2016 to 4.55% in 2017 resulted in an increase of interest income of $492,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans increased $1,235,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $17,451,000, or 15.7%, to $128,841,000 for 2017, resulting in a $744,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 38 basis points to 4.64% providing an additional $491,000 in interest income.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $58,000 from 2016. When comparing the same periods, average balances decreased $2,896,000 to $35,742,000, which contributed a $111,000 decrease in interest income. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio from 3.80% for 2016 to 3.95% for 2017, resulting in additional interest income of $53,000.\nIndirect lease financing receivables represent loans to small businesses that are collateralized by equipment. In October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts. Interest income in 2016 included $702,000 from these contracts.\nInterest income for retail lending increased $577,000 in 2017 compared with 2016, driven by both the increase in average balances and rising rates in 2017.\nAverage residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $6,009,000, or 13.3%, to $51,242,000 for 2017. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio remained level at 3.89% for 2017 and 2016. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $237,000 in 2017.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $110,000. Average balances in this segment increased $1,663,000. This growth in volume contributed $98,000 to the increase in income, and the 19-basis point increase in the average yield from 5.20% in 2016 to 5.39% in 2017 contributed to an increase in interest income of $12,000.\n- 26 -\nDeposits and Borrowings\n2018 versus 2017\nEarning assets are funded primarily by deposits, which increased on average by $40,656,000, or 4.2%, to $1,003,154,000, when comparing 2018 and 2017. Total interest expense for 2018 was $8,185,000 compared with $5,680,000 for 2017, an increase of $2,505,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $2,086,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $419,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 21 basis points; the rate paid on borrowings increased 58 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as the competition for deposits increases.\nConsistent with the past several years, the growth in deposits during 2018 was centered in accounts with greater liquidity. Average non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $8,814,000, or 7.2%, to $130,633,000 for 2018; QNB has been successful in increasing both personal and business checking accounts. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $24,432,000, or 14.4%, to $194,372,000 for 2018 compared with 2017, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $336,000 to $689,000 for 2018. The average rate paid increased 14 basis points to 0.35% for 2018 compared to 0.21% for 2017. Interest-bearing business checking account average balances increased by $14,265,000, or 72.8%, and related interest expense increased $276,000, or 77 basis points in yield, when comparing the two years. This was primarily due to one large commercial customer consolidating both existing and external accounts. Also included in this category is QNB-Rewards checking, a tiered-rate checking account product. In order to receive the high rate a customer must receive an electronic statement, have one direct deposit or other ACH transaction and have at least 12 check card purchase transactions post and clear per statement cycle. If these qualifications are not met, the rate paid for 2017 was 0.20% increasing during 2018 to 0.25%. For 2018, the average balance in this product was $54,188,000 and the related interest expense was $338,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.62%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2017 was $50,907,000, yielding 0.55%. The rates paid on the QNB-Rewards product, assuming qualifications are met, is attractive relative to competitors' offerings as well as other QNB products. This product also generates fee income through the use of the check card. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $99,451,000 for 2017 to $106,337,000 for 2018. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.05% for both years.\nAverage money market accounts decreased $6,490,000, or 7.7%, to $77,713,000 for 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to higher yielding certificates of deposits. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $80,000 to $329,000 for 2018 compared with 2017. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.42% for 2018, an increase of 12 basis points compared with 2017. The balances in this category primarily comprise Select money market accounts, a product that pays a tiered rate based on account balances. The balances remaining in these accounts for 2018 were primarily at higher-yielding tiers.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $753,000 to $1,537,000 for 2018. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $3,641,000, or 3.3%, to $106,411,000 while the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased 73 basis points to 1.44% for 2018 from 0.71% for 2017. Most of these accounts are indexed to the Federal funds rate with negotiated rate floors between 0.25% and 0.50%. Many of these deposits are seasonal in nature and are received during the third quarter as tax receipts are collected and are withdrawn over the course of the next year.\nQNB's online e-Savings product is the largest category of savings deposits and was created to compete with other online savings accounts. Average balances grew $13,395,000, or 7.4%, to $195,258,000 in 2018 compared with $181,863,000 in 2017. The rate on this product increased from 0.65% at the end of 2017 to 0.85% in December 2018. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.58% for 2017 and 0.79% for 2018. The yield on this account may rise along with market rates and as competition for savings balances increases. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $3,657,000, or 5.4%, to $71,688,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.62% for 2018, a 16-basis point increase from 2017 while interest expense increased $501,000, from $1,156,000 to $1,657,000 over the same period. The growth in balances appears to reflect the desire for liquidity and a better rate than short-term time deposits.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $416,000, to $3,301,000 in 2018, due to a 22-basis point increase in yield, from 1.27% in 2017 to 1.45% in 2018. The increase in average balances was $489,000 in 2018, to $227,079,000. Similar to fixed-rate loans and investment securities, time deposits reprice over time and, therefore, have less of an immediate impact on costs in either a rising or falling rate environment. However, the maturity and repricing characteristics of time deposits tend to be shorter.\nApproximately $78,931,000, or 35.3%, in time deposits will reprice or mature over the next 12 months compared with 42.7% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017. The average rate paid on these time deposits is approximately 1.06%. QNB has extended the maturity of the time deposit portfolio by offering attractive rates at terms greater than 12 months. Interest expense is expected to increase along with competition for deposits.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2018 of $38,172,000 and $22,767,000, respectively. Interest\n- 27 -\nexpense on short-term borrowings increased by $419,000 to $672,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances of borrowings from correspondent banks increased $13,396,000. The increase in these borrowings was the primary contributor to the increase in the average rate paid from 0.52% to 1.10%.\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal interest expense for 2017 was $5,680,000 compared with $4,733,000 for 2016, an increase of $947,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $848,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $99,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on both interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearings liabilities increased seven basis points; the rate paid on borrowings increased 14 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as short-term interest rates begin to rise and the competition for deposits increases.\nAverage non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $14,240,000, or 13.2%, to $121,819,000 for 2017. Business checking account average balances increased by $11,707,000, or 13.5%, when comparing the two years. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $16,342,000, or 10.6%, to $169,940,000 for 2017 compared with 2016, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $38,000 to $353,000 for 2017. The average rate paid remained unchanged at 0.21% for 2016 and 2017. The average balance in QNB-Rewards checking was $50,907,000 and the related interest expense was $281,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.55%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2016 was $44,918,000, yielding 0.56%. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $108,680,000 for 2016 to $119,033,000 for 2017. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.06% for both years. Average money market accounts increased $12,947,000, or 18.2%, to $84,203,000 for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to more liquid accounts. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $57,000 to $249,000 for 2017 compared with 2016. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.30% for 2017, an increase of three basis points compared with 2016.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $433,000 to $784,000 for 2017. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $7,992,000, or 7.8%, to $110,052,000 and the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased 37 basis points to 0.71% for 2017 from 0.34% for 2016.\nOnline eSavings account average balances grew $13,503,000, or 8.0%, to $181,863,000 in 2017 compared with $168,360,000 in 2016. The rate on this product was changed from 0.55% at the end of 2016 to 0.65% in late December 2017. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.50% for 2016 and 0.58% for 2017. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $6,612,000, or 10.8%, to $68,031,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.46% for 2017, a six-basis point increase from 2016 while interest expense increased $233,000, from $923,000 to $1,156,000 over the same period.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $87,000, to $2,885,000 in 2017, due to a four-basis point increase in yield, from 1.23% in 2016 to 1.27% in 2017. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average balances of $1,679,000 in 2017, to $226,590,000.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2017 of $39,301,000 and $9,371,000, respectively. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $99,000 to $253,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances increased $8,472,000 to $48,672,000, and the average rate paid increased 14 basis points, from 0.38% to 0.52%.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents management's determination of the amount necessary to be charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. QNB recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,130,000, $1,400,000 and $30,000 for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the $220,000 reversal in allowance for loan losses associated with the sale of the indirect lease finance portfolio, the 2016 provision would have been $250,000. Net loan charge-offs were $137,000, or 0.02% of total average loans for 2018 compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of total average loans in 2017 and $190,000, or 0.03%, in 2016. The majority of the loans charged off during 2018 and 2017 had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loans. Deterioration in credit quality or significant growth in the loan portfolio may result in a higher provision for loan losses in 2019.\n- 28 -\nNon-Interest Income\n\n2018 versus 2017\nQNB, through its core banking business, generates various fees and service charges. Total non-interest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and check card income, retail brokerage and advisory income, income on bank-owned life insurance, merchant income and gains and losses on investment securities and residential mortgage loans. Total non-interest income was $4,892,000 in 2018 compared with $6,887,000 in 2017, a decrease of $1,995,000.\nFees for services to customers are primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts. These fees were $1,699,000 for 2018, an increase of $31,000, or 1.9%, from 2017. Overdraft income, which represented approximately 78% and 76% of total fees for services to customers in 2018 and 2017, respectively, increased by $50,000, or 3.9%, when comparing 2018 to 2017. The increase in overdraft income primarily reflects an increase in the number of overdraft occurrences.\nATM and debit card income is primarily comprised of transaction income on debit cards and ATM cards and ATM surcharge income for the use of QNB's ATM machines by non-QNB customers. ATM and debit card income was $1,895,000 in 2018, an increase of $146,000, or 8.3%, from the amount recorded in 2017. Debit card interchange income increased $147,000, or 8.7%, to $1,841,000 in 2018, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $1,000 to $54,000. The growth in checking accounts and card usage contributed to the increase in debit card income, including the QNB Rewards checking product, a tiered-rate checking account which requires, among other terms, the posting of a minimum of twelve debit card purchase transactions per statement cycle to receive the high interest rate.\nQNB provides securities and advisory services under the name QNB Financial Services through an independent third-party registered Broker/Dealer and Registered Investment Advisor. QNB terminated its contract with its third-party broker-dealer effective August 1, 2018 and entered into a similar arrangement with another third-party provider. QNB Financial Services staff are in the process of transferring accounts to the new provider's platform and expect the transfer to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019. QNB receives a percentage of the revenue generated but is responsible for salaries and expenses of advisors who are QNB employees. Retail brokerage and advisory revenue was $370,000 for 2018 compared with $436,000 in 2017, a decline of $66,000, or 15.1%. There were less sales in front-loaded products, such as annuities and alternative investments (which include private equity, hedge funds, managed futures, real estate REITs\u201d, commodities and derivatives contracts) in 2018 than in 2017, resulting in a $103,000 reduction of revenues. In 2017 and throughout 2018, there was a transition to move toward advanced advisory fees based on assets under management in lieu of fees per transaction; advisory fees increased $87,000 comparing 2018 to 2017. In 2018, the net income provided by QNB Financial Services was $22,000, compared with $13,000 in net income for 2017.\nIncome on bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) represents the earnings and death benefits on life insurance policies in which the Bank is the beneficiary. The insurance carriers reset the rates on these policies annually taking into consideration the interest rate environment as well as mortality costs. The existing policies have rate floors which minimize how low the earnings rate can go. Some of these policies are currently at their floor. Income on these policies during 2017 was $345,000, including a death benefit of $52,000, compared to $291,000 for 2018.\n- 29 -\nMerchant income represents fees charged to merchants for the Bank's handling of credit card or charge sales. Merchant income was $326,000 for 2018, a decrease of $19,000, or 5.5%, from the amount reported in 2017. The decrease in merchant income is primarily a result of competitive pricing and a loss of customers.\nThe fixed-income securities portfolio represents a significant portion of QNB's earning assets and is also a primary tool in liquidity and asset/liability management. QNB actively manages its fixed-income portfolio to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve, changes in spread relationships in different sectors, and for liquidity purposes. Management continually reviews strategies that will result in an increase in the yield or improvement in the structure of the investment portfolio, including monitoring credit and concentration risk in the portfolio. In addition, the Corporation owns a small portfolio of equity securities for the purpose of generating both dividend income and capital appreciation.\nNet gains on investment securities decreased $1,576,000 to a net loss of $76,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with a gain of $1,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in greater opportunities for profitable sales in 2017 compared with 2018. QNB sold equity investment securities during 2018 to minimize potential future losses on certain securities. The prolonged decline in market value of one equity security in 2017 resulted in recording other than temporary impairment charges of $80,000. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $1,477,000 in 2017. Strong performance in the U.S. equity markets during 2017, enabled QNB to sell some equity holdings and recognize gains. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $5,000 and $23,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the following two years. The adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) effective January 1, 2018 requires the Company to record unrealized gains or losses on equity securities through earnings, rather than in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders' equity. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $336,000 during 2018. There was no corresponding unrealized gain or loss recognized on equity securities for 2017, which preceded the effective date for ASU 2016-01.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio, as lack of market volatility and the interest rate environment resulted in declining performance of the portfolio. The net realized gains recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $27,000.\nThe net gain on residential mortgage sales is directly related to the volume of mortgages sold and the timing of the sales relative to the interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loans to be sold are identified at origination. The net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $105,000 and $276,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Mortgage refinance activity decreased in 2018, as rate volatility prompted borrowers to delay borrowing. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $4,478,000 and $9,041,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2018 and 2017 are $33,000 and $66,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets. The remaining $99,000 gain on sale of loans in 2017 is attributed to QNB's portion of a purchased participation loan with no carrying balance that was sold.\nQNB retains servicing rights for residential mortgages sold in the secondary market. A servicing fee is retained on all mortgage loans sold and serviced. QNB recognizes its obligation to service financial assets that are retained in a transfer of assets in the form of a servicing asset. The servicing asset is amortized in proportion to, and over, the period of net servicing income or loss. On a quarterly basis, servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on their fair value. Mortgage servicing income of $126,000 for 2018 and $114,000 for 2017 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income, excluding mortgage servicing income, was $492,000 for 2018, an increase of $164,000 from the amount recorded in 2017. Other non-interest income for 2018 included $48,000 in broker-dealer conversion costs reimbursement and a $57,000 sales tax refund. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, and check sale commissions of $55,000, $15,000, and $18,000, respectively, were partially offset by a reduction in title company income of $10,000, when comparing 2018 to 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal non-interest income was $6,887,000 in 2017 compared with $5,667,000 in 2016, an increase of $1,220,000. Excluding the loss on sale of indirect finance leasing portfolio of $223,000 in 2016, the increase in non-interest income was $997,000, comparing 2017 to 2016.\nFees for services to customers were $1,668,000 for 2017, an increase of $47,000, or 2.9%, from 2016. Overdraft income increased by $44,000, or 3.6%, when comparing 2017 to 2016. ATM and debit card income was $1,749,000 in 2017, an increase of $98,000, or 5.9%, from the amount recorded in 2016. Debit card interchange income increased $103,000, or 6.5%, to $1,694,000 in 2017, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $5,000, to $55,000.\n- 30 -\nRetail brokerage and advisory revenue was $436,000 for 2017 compared with $603,000 in 2016, a decline of $167,000, or 27.7%. There were less sales in front-loaded products in 2017 than in 2016, resulting in a $260,000 reduction of revenues. In 2017 there was a transition to move toward advanced advisory fees based on assets under management in lieu of fees per transaction; advisory fees increased $106,000 comparing 2017 to 2016.\nIncome on BOLI policies during 2017 was $345,000, including a death benefit of $52,000, compared to $308,000 for 2016. Merchant income was $345,000 for 2017, an increase of $11,000, or 3.3%, from the amount reported in 2016.\nNet gains on investment securities increased $826,000 to $1,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $674,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in greater opportunities for profitable sales in 2017 compared with 2016. The prolonged decline in market value of one equity security in 2017 and two equity securities in 2016 resulted in recording other than temporary impairment charges of $80,000 and $192,000, respectively. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $1,477,000 and $566,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $23,000 and $108,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Both the 2017 and 2016 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the next two years. In June 2017, QNB Bank sold five non-performing pooled trust preferred securities ( PreTSL\u201d), with a $2,235,000 carrying value, recording a loss on sale of $15,000, included in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Several years ago, QNB had recorded $1,152,000 in OTTI for four of these five PreTSLs, and subsequently applied any cashflow received to the balance of these non-performing, nonaccrual assets. Improvement in market prices for these PreTSLs during the second quarter 2017 reduced realized losses, and the reduction of approximately $19,000,000 in risk-based assets required for these bonds drove the decision to redeem these debt securities.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio; the net realized gains recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $27,000. The net realized and unrealized losses recorded at December 31, 2016 were $40,000 and fair value was $3,596,000. Unrealized gains on trading activity related to trading securities held at December 31, 2016 totaled $69,000.\nIn October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts and recorded a loss of $223,000.\nThe net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $276,000 and $320,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $9,041,000 and $9,204,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2017 and 2016 are $66,000 and $69,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets. The remaining $99,000 gain on sale of loans in 2017 is attributed to QNB's portion of a purchased participation loan with no carrying balance that was sold. Mortgage servicing income of $114,000 for 2017 and $125,000 for 2016 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income was $328,000 for 2017, an increase of $34,000 from the amount recorded in 2016. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, check sale commissions, and merchant loss recoveries of $50,000, $8,000, $7,000, and $6,000, respectively, were partially offset by a reduction in sales tax refunds of $36,000, when comparing 2017 to 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense\n\n- 31 -\n2018 versus 2017\nNon-interest expense is comprised of costs related to salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy, furniture and equipment, marketing, third party services, FDIC insurance premiums, regulatory assessments and taxes and various other operating expenses. Total non-interest expense was $25,885,000 in 2018, an increase of $2,165,000, or 9.1%, from the $23,720,000 recorded in 2017. QNB's overhead efficiency ratio, which represents the percentage of each dollar of revenue that is used for non-interest expense, is calculated by taking non-interest expense divided by net operating revenue (tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income). QNB's efficiency ratios for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 63.6%, 58.0%, and 61.9%, respectively. The increase in the 2018 efficiency ratio is primarily due to security net gains in 2017 of $1,500,000 versus net losses in 2018 of $412,000 and partially due to tax rate changes under the 2017 Tax Reform Act impacting the tax-equivalence of interest income.\nSalaries and benefits expense is the largest component of non-interest expense. QNB monitors, using various surveys, the competitive salary and benefit information in its markets and makes adjustments when appropriate. Salaries and benefits expense for 2018 was $14,411,000, an increase of $1,290,000 compared with $13,121,000 reported in 2017. Salary expense for 2018 was $11,444,000, an increase of $848,000 compared with $10,596,000 reported in 2017. Included in salary expense in 2018 was incentive compensation plus related payroll taxes of $910,000, a $293,000 increase over incentive compensation in 2017. Benefit expense for 2018 was $2,967,000, an increase of $442,000, or 17.5%, from the amount recorded in 2017 with payroll taxes increasing $13,000 as salary expense increased. Medical premiums increased $336,000. Retirement plan matching and safe harbor increased $75,000 compared to 2017. QNB utilized unvested forfeited 401(k) contributions to offset retirement plan matching in 2018 and 2017.\nNet occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased $389,000, to $4,037,000 when comparing 2018 to 2017, due primarily to increased software, higher depreciation resulting from 2018 renovations and a branch relocation, building and equipment maintenance and branch rent.\nMarketing expense was $927,000 for 2018, a $13,000 increase from the expense recorded in 2017. Marketing expenses related to public relations increased $23,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 2017. QNB's contributions and sponsorships for not-for-profit organizations, events and clubs in the communities it serves are included in public relations expense.\nThird party services are comprised of professional services, including legal, accounting, auditing and consulting services, as well as fees paid to outside vendors for support services of day-to-day operations. These support services include correspondent banking services, statement printing and mailing, investment security safekeeping and supply management services. Third party services increased $281,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to increased legal services of $62,000, information technology third party services of $69,000, tax preparation fees of $36,000 related to method changes implemented for the 2017 returns, and other third-party services.\nTelephone, postage and supplies expense decreased $119,000, or 14.8%, to $685,000 in 2018, compared with 2017. Supplies expense decreased $21,000 in 2018, as additional supplies related to EMV chip debit card production were purchased in 2017. Telecommunications expense decreased $74,000 due cost savings related to the consolidation of services. Postage expense decreased $24,000; additional expense was incurred in 2017 due to the issuance to EMV chip debit cards.\nFDIC insurance premium expense increased $47,000, or 8.1%, in 2018. The premium assessment formula for small institutions was changed by the FDIC and implemented in late 2016 and is based on asset growth and related risk assumptions determined by the FDIC as well as capital. Small institutions, for FDIC premium assessments purposes, are defined as those with total consolidated assets less than $10 billion. On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36%. Because the reserve ratio has exceeded 1.35%, a change impacting QNB's deposit insurance assessment occurred under the FDIC regulations: Small institutions were awarded assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. On January 24, 2019, QNB was notified by the FDIC that its preliminary estimated credit was approximately $234,000, which would be recognized in future periods.\nState tax expense represents the payment of the Pennsylvania Shares Tax and Pennsylvania sales and use tax. State tax expense was $727,000 and $687,000 for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $3,000 of the expense in this category. The increase in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of growth of the Bank's capital.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $224,000, or 9.5%, primarily due to check card expense, employee training and business development costs.\n- 32 -\n2017 versus 2016\nTotal non-interest expense was $23,720,000 in 2017, an increase of $1,557,000, or 7.0%, from the $22,163,000 recorded in 2016. Salaries and benefits expense for 2017 was $13,121,000, an increase of $1,110,000 compared with $12,011,000 reported in 2016. Salary expense for 2017 was $10,596,000, an increase of $1,078,000 compared with $9,518,000 reported in 2016. Included in salary expense in 2017 was incentive compensation plus related payroll taxes of $617,000, a $418,000 increase over incentive compensation in 2016. Benefit expense for 2017 was $2,525,000, an increase of $32,000, or 1.3%, from the amount recorded in 2016 with payroll taxes increasing $52,000 as salary expense increased. Retirement plan matching and safe harbor increased $56,000 compared to 2016; QNB utilized unvested forfeited 401(k) contributions to offset retirement plan matching in 2017. Post-retirement life insurance expense decreased $71,000 due to a death claim which reduced the post-retirement liability.\nNet occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased $145,000, to $3,648,000 when comparing 2017 to 2016, due primarily to increased software, building and equipment maintenance and branch rent, offset in part by lower depreciation.\nMarketing expense was $914,000 for 2017, a $108,000 increase from the expense recorded in 2016. Marketing expenses related to public relations increased $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016. QNB contributions and sponsorships for not-for-profit organizations, events and clubs in the communities it serves is included in public relations expense.\nThird party services decreased $83,000 when comparing the two periods, due to decreased legal services and other third-party services.\nTelephone, postage and supplies expense increased $52,000, or 6.9%, to $804,000 in 2017, compared with 2016. Supplies expense decreased $11,000 in 2017, as additional supplies related to EMV chip debit card production, anticipated throughout 2017, were purchased in 2016. Telecommunications expense increased $41,000 due increased data line capacity. Postage expense increased $22,000.\nFDIC insurance premium expense increased $9,000, or 1.6%, in 2017, due to a change in the premium assessment formula announced by the FDIC in 2016, establishing reduced premium assessment formulas for small institutions.\nState tax expense was $687,000 and $666,000 for the years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $2,000 of the expense in this category. The increase in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of growth of the Bank's capital.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $195,000, or 9.0%, primarily due to check card expense, offset in part by a reduction in foreclosure expense.\nIncome Taxes\nApplicable income tax expense and effective tax rates were $1,557,000, or 12.1%, for 2018 compared with $5,900,000, or 41.6%, for 2017. Under the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21%; therefore, QNB recorded a charge reflecting the revaluation of its net deferred tax assets from 34% to 21% at December 31, 2017 resulting in additional tax expense of $2,054,000. In 2018, QNB elected to change its tax methods for bad debt conformity and for loan originations costs effective with the filing of the 2017 tax return which resulted in a tax benefit of $415,000. These discrete tax items were recorded in 2018.\n- 33 -\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the event of disclosure or release of non-GAAP financial measures, the SEC Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate excluding the discrete items was 15.3% primarily due to the decrease in the tax rate from 34% to 21%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate excluding the Tax Reform charge was 27.1%. The higher effective tax rate year over year is predominately a result of tax-exempt income from loans and securities comprising a smaller proportional share of pre-tax income than the prior year and greater state tax expense. QNB expects the effective tax rate in 2019 to be similar to the 15.3%, less than the 21% corporate rate, due to its holdings of tax-free assets, including municipal bonds, municipal loans, and life insurance contracts. For a more comprehensive analysis of income tax expense and deferred taxes, refer to Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition\nASSETS\nThe following table presents total assets at the dates indicated:\n\nCash and interest-earning deposits\nTotal cash and cash equivalents decreased $2,873,000 from $16,331,000 at December 31, 2017 to $13,458,000 at December 31, 2018. QNB had interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of $489,000 at December 31, 2018 compared with $863,000 at December 31, 2017. Loan growth more than offset the proceeds received from the maturity, prepayment and sales of investment securities and deposit growth.\n- 34 -\nInvestment Securities and Other Short-Term Investments\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, QNB had no Federal funds sold. With the Federal funds rate between 1.50% and 2.50%, excess funds for liquidity purposes are kept at the Federal Reserve, which was paying 1.50% until the Federal Open Market Committee raised the targeted Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points four times in 2018 in mid-March 2018, mid-June 2018, mid-September 2018 and in mid-December 2018. These funds carry a 0% risk weighting for risk-based capital calculation purposes.\n\nAt December 31, 2018, approximately 76% of QNB's investment securities were either U.S. Government agency debt securities, U.S. Government agency issued mortgage-backed securities or CMOs. As of December 31, 2018, QNB held no securities of any one issue or any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government and its agencies) that were in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity.\nThe QNB investment portfolio represents a significant portion of earning assets and interest income. QNB actively manages the investment portfolio in an attempt to maximize earnings, while considering liquidity needs, interest rate risk and credit risk. The decrease of the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets in 2018 is due to loan growth. Proceeds from the sale of investments were $9,061,000 in 2018 compared with $42,509,000 during 2017.\nIn addition to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities, proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments of securities were $48,074,000 in 2018 compared with $52,994,000 in 2017. During 2018, $36,236,000 of investment securities were purchased compared with $85,265,000 during 2017.\nThe balance of U.S. Government agency securities decreased $2,115,000 to $68,409,000 at December 31, 2018 and represents 19.3% of the investment portfolio compared with 18.6% at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of two securities. U.S. Government agency issued CMO and MBS balances decreased $17,601,000 to $201,404,000 and represents 57.0% of the portfolio compared with 57.7% at December 31, 2017. These bonds provide monthly cash flow to be reinvested in either loans or other securities, potentially at higher yields as rates increase.\nThe balance of municipal securities decreased $10,491,000 to $66,313,000 at December 31, 2018, representing 18.8% of the investment portfolio compared with 20.2% at December 31, 2017. QNB focuses on the financial performance of the underlying issuer for municipal bond purchases in addition to the bond rating of the issuer or the rating of bond insurer, if present. Nineteen bonds with a book value of $8,150,000 were called or matured in 2018 and three bonds were sold for $1,964,000. The demand for tax-exempt municipal securities has declined as the tax-equivalent yield is becoming less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics.\n- 35 -\nQNB owns one collateralized debt obligations ( CDO\u201d) in the form of a pooled trust preferred security. The security is mainly comprised of securities issued by banks or bank holding companies. QNB owns the mezzanine tranche of this security. The security is structured so that the senior and mezzanine tranches are protected from defaults by over-collateralization and cash flow default protection provided by subordinated tranches. The trust preferred security the Bank continues to hold has a carrying balance of $116,000 at December 31, 2018 and represents the senior-most obligation of the trust. There was no credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charge during 2018, 2017 or 2016. Future estimates of fair value of the remaining security could require recording additional OTTI charges through earnings. For additional detail on these securities see Notes 4 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity securities increased $4,446,000 to $9,421,000 at December 31, 2018 from $4,975,000 at December 31, 2017. QNB sold $4,902,000 in equity securities for a net loss of $79,000; QNB purchased $9,763,000 in equities during 2018.\nQNB accounts for its investments by classifying securities into four categories. Debt securities that QNB has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.\nInvestment Portfolio Maturities and Weighted Average Yields\n\nSecurities are assigned to categories based on stated contractual maturity except for mortgage-backed securities and CMOs which are based on anticipated payment periods and state and municipal securities which are based on pre-refunded date, if applicable. Tax-exempt securities were adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis and are based on the marginal Federal corporate tax rate of 21% and a Tax Equity and Financial Responsibility Act ( TEFRA\u201d) adjustment for the cost of funds. Weighted average yields on investment securities available-for-sale are based on amortized cost.\n- 36 -\nInvestment Securities - Trading\nIn 2014, QNB established a small percentage of its investment portfolio as trading in an effort to boost yields and income. During the second quarter 2017, QNB Bank redeemed the trading securities portfolio, as lack of market volatility and the interest rate environment resulted in declining performance of the portfolio, since its inception in 2014. QNB recorded a net gain of $27,000 for 2017 in non-interest income.\nInvestments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities include securities that management intends to use as part of its liquidity and asset/liability management strategy. These securities may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the securities prepayment or credit risk, the need for liquidity, or growth in loan demand. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of investment debt securities available-for-sale was $344,221,000, or $9,028,000 below the amortized cost of $353,249,000. This compares to a fair value of $374,570,000, or $5,870,000 below the amortized cost of $380,440,000, at December 31, 2017. The available-for-sale portfolio, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, had a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.8 years at December 31, 2018 and 4.3 years at December 31, 2017. The weighted average tax-equivalent yield, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, was 2.38% and 2.36% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe weighted average maturity is based on the stated contractual maturity or likely call date of all securities except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on estimated average life. The maturity of the portfolio could become shorter if interest rates declined and prepayments on MBS and CMOs increased or securities are called. However, the estimated average life could lengthen if interest rates were to increase and principal payments on MBS and CMOs slowed or securities anticipated to be called extend past their call date.\nInvestments Held-To-Maturity Debt Securities\nQNB did not hold any held-to-maturity security during 2018 or 2017.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nQNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. This ASU was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on January 5, 2016 to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The FASB issued ASU 2018-03 in February 2018 which provides technical corrections and improvements to ASU 2016-01. QNB used the modified retrospective method for transition in which the cumulative effect will be recognized at the date of adoption with no restatement of comparative periods presented. QNB reclassified a loss, net of taxes, of $254,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of the equity securities was $4,975,000, or $321,000 below the cost of $5,296,000. Increases and decreases in the fair value were recognized in net income during 2018. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of the equity securities was $9,421,000, or $658,000 below the cost of $10,079,000.\nLoans\nQNB's primary business is to accept deposits and to make loans to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves. Loans are the most significant component of earning assets, and growth in loans to small businesses and residents of these communities has been a primary focus of QNB. Inherent within the lending function is the evaluation and acceptance of credit risk and interest rate risk. QNB manages credit risk associated with its lending activities through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices.\nQNB has comprehensive policies and procedures that define and govern commercial and retail loan originations and the management of risk. All loans are underwritten in a manner that emphasizes the borrowers' capacity to pay. The measurement of capacity to pay delineates the potential risk of non-payment or default. The higher potential for default determines the need for and amount of collateral required. QNB makes unsecured commercial loans when the capacity to pay is considered substantial. As capacity lessens, collateral is required to provide a secondary source of repayment and to mitigate the risk of loss. Various policies and procedures provide guidance to the lenders on such factors as amount, terms, price, maturity and appropriate collateral levels. Each risk factor is considered critical to ensuring that QNB receives an adequate return for the risk undertaken, and that the risk of loss is minimized.\nQNB manages the risk associated with commercial loans by having lenders work in tandem with credit analysts while maintaining independence between personnel. In addition, a Bank loan committee and a committee of the Board of Directors review and approve certain loan requests on a weekly basis. Other than disclosed in the forthcoming Loan Portfolio Table, at December 31, 2018, there was a concentration of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings of 15.8% of total loans and to lessors of nonresidential buildings of 18.1% of total loans, compared with 15.7% and of 17.3% of total loans, respectively, at December 31, 2017. These concentrations were primarily within the commercial real estate categories.\n- 37 -\nQNB moved from an eight-grade risk rating system to a ten-grade system in 2018, further disaggregating the credit quality of the loan portfolio to enhance credit risk strategies.\nQNB's commercial lending activity is focused on small businesses within the local community. Commercial purpose loans are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay these loans depends on the successful operation of the borrower's business. The assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these types of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, to cash. Commercial and industrial loans represent commercial purpose loans that are either secured by collateral other than real estate or unsecured.\nCommercial loans secured by commercial real estate include commercial purpose loans collateralized at least in part by commercial real estate. Some of these loans may not be for the express purpose of conducting commercial real estate transactions. Commercial loans secured by residential real estate are commercial purpose loans generally secured by the business owner's residence or residential investment properties owned by the borrower and rented to tenants. Commercial loans secured by either commercial real estate or residential real estate are originated primarily within the Eastern Pennsylvania market area, are within the Bank's underwriting criteria, and generally include the guarantee of the borrowers. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions are tax-exempt or taxable loans to municipalities, school districts and housing and industrial development authorities. These loans can be general obligations of the municipality or school district repaid through their taxing authority, revenue obligations repaid through the income generated by the operations of the authority, such as a water or sewer authority, or loans issued to a housing and industrial development agency, for which a private corporation is responsible for payments on the loans.\nThe Company originates fixed rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. To reduce interest rate risk, qualifying originations of fixed-rate loans to individuals for 1-4 family residential mortgages with maturities of 15 years or greater are generally sold in the secondary market. Mortgage loan origination activity declined in 2018 with $4,373,000 in residential mortgages originated for sale during 2018, compared with $7,976,000 for 2017. There were no residential mortgage loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nThe home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. These loans are often in a junior lien position and therefore carry a higher risk than first lien 1-4 family residential loans. Risks associated with loans secured by residential properties, either first lien residential mortgages or home equity loans and lines, are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market. Since most loans are secured by a primary or secondary residence, the borrower's continued employment is the greatest risk to repayment.\nThe Company offers a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than loans secured by residential real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess or more likely to decrease in value than real estate. Credit risk in this portfolio is controlled by conservative underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower, and, if secured, the value of the collateral.\nTotal loan receivables at December 31, 2018 were $785,448,000, an increase of $52,165,000, or 7.1%, from December 31, 2017. This follows a 15.8% increase in outstanding loans in 2017. A key financial ratio, loans to deposits, improved slightly to 77.3% at December 31, 2018, compared with 73.8% at December 31, 2017. QNB continues to be committed to make loans available to credit worthy consumers and businesses.\n- 38 -\n\n\nDemand loans and loans with no stated maturity are included in one year or less. Table details final maturity.\nThe following shows the amount of loans due after one year that have fixed interest rates and variable or adjustable interest rates at December 31, 2018:\nLoans with fixed predetermined interest rates: $97,309,000\nLoans with variable or adjustable interest rates: $546,702,000\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation table on Page 42 shows the percentage composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years. There was very little change in the composition of the portfolio between the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Loans secured by commercial real estate represent the largest sector of the portfolio, increasing slightly from 39.1% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 39.3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018, as the balances in this sector grew by $21,723,000, or 7.6%, from $286,867,000 at December 31, 2017 to $308,590,000 at December 31, 2018. While loans secured by commercial real estate represent a significant portion of the total portfolio, the collateral is diversified, including investment properties, manufacturing facilities, office buildings, hospitals, retirement and nursing home facilities, warehouses and owner-occupied facilities. Commercial real estate loans have drawn the attention of the regulators in recent years as a potential source of risk. QNB monitors these types of loans closely, obtaining updated appraisals on loans classified substandard or worse. As detailed in the Allowance for Loan Losses table, QNB had no charge-offs in this category in 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nCommercial loans secured by residential real estate decreased by $3,122,000, or 4.4%, to $68,581,000 at December 31, 2018 and at 8.7% represent a slightly smaller share of the overall portfolio than the 9.8% at December 31, 2017. Some of the properties that serve as collateral for these loans are located outside the Bank's market area and have experienced vacancies and significant declines in market value. Charge-offs in this category have significantly decreased over the past three years. Non-accrual commercial loans secured by residential real estate were $1,102,000, $1,458,000, and $1,866,000 at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and loan charge-offs were $77,000, $23,000, and $120,000, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, approximately $77,000 of the charge-offs were out-of-market investment properties, compared with all of the $23,000 in charge-offs in 2017 and approximately $96,000 of the $120,000 charge-offs in 2016.\n- 39 -\nCommercial and industrial loans, the second largest sector of the portfolio, experienced growth in balances of $15,262,000, or 10.4%, to $162,452,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed a growth in this category of $36,957,000, or 33.5%, in 2017. Commercial and industrial loans represented 20.7% of the portfolio at year-end 2018 compared with 20.1% at December 31, 2017. This category of loans generally presents a greater risk than loans secured by real estate since these loans are either secured by accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, or are unsecured. During 2017, nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan balances decreased $1,431,000 to $3,367,000, the majority of which is due to the partial charge-off of one credit of $896,000 which was downgraded in 2017. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, charge-offs were $0, $960,000, and $140,000, respectively.\nConstruction loans decreased 2.0% from $51,157,000, or 7.0% of the portfolio at December 31, 2017, to $50,135,000, or 6.4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018. These loans are primarily to developers and builders for the construction of residential units or commercial buildings or to businesses for the construction of owner-occupied facilities. This portfolio is diversified among different types of collateral including: 1-4 family residential construction, medical and retirement home facilities, office buildings, hotels and land for development loans. Construction loans are generally made only on projects that have municipal approval. These loans are usually originated to include a short construction period followed by permanent financing provided through a commercial mortgage after construction is complete. Once construction is complete, the balance is moved to the secured by commercial real estate category if the permanent financing is provided by the Bank. There were no charge-offs in the construction loan portfolio since 2011, and no construction loans on non-accrual since 2014.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions increased $5,650,000, or 14.8%, from $38,087,000 at December 31, 2017 to $43,737,000 at December 31, 2018. This sector increased from 5.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 5.6% at December 31, 2018. Many municipalities, counties and school districts refinanced their existing bonds or bank debt and, as a result, QNB had an opportunity to successfully bid on many of these local issues. The increase in 2018 was due to some of the commitments for large projects won during 2016 that started to fund during the first quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act made the tax effective yield on loans to state and political subdivisions less favorable than experienced historically.\nResidential mortgage loans secured by first lien balances increased by $11,635,000, or 20.8%, to $67,453,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed an increase of $8,694,000, or 18.4%, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. In 2018 and 2017, QNB retained some adjustable and fixed rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios.\nBalances in home equity loans and lines increased $1,899,000, or 2.5%, to $77,475,000 at December 31, 2018. During 2018, QNB continued to offer very attractive rates on both variable and fixed rate home equity loans and lines. These attractive rates, along with excellent customer service, including quick turnaround time, contributed to the growth in home equity balances. With continued improvement in home values as well as the local economy, it is expected that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nConsumer loan balances increased $105,000 to $6,785,000 at December 31, 2018. In 2013, QNB reentered the private student loan market through a relationship with iHelp. These student loans are either fixed or variable rate with the rate dependent on the credit scores of the student and/or the cosigner. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of student loans was $3,822,000, an increase of $86,000 compared with December 31, 2017. Student loan balances will decline, as their balances are no longer insured, and QNB ceased funding originations through iHelp.\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans, OREO and repossessed assets and non-performing trust preferred securities. Non-performing assets totaled $9,638,000, or 0.82% of total assets at December 31, 2018, a $396,000 increase over the $9,242,000, or 0.80% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Included in non-performing assets in 2016 is $2,281,000, of pooled trust preferred securities. In June 2017, QNB Bank sold five non-performing pooled trust preferred securities with a $2,235,000 carrying value. The Bank's remaining trust preferred security was returned to accruing status in June 2017.\nTotal non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and troubled debt restructured loans were $9,638,000, or 1.23% of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared with $9,242,000, or 1.26% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Loans on non-accrual status were $7,478,000 at December 31, 2018 compared with $7,921,000 at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns of $1,683,000, charge-offs of $118,000, and loans returned to accruing status of $1,237,000, of which $1,045,000 were performing under troubled debt restructurings; this was partially offset by $2,595,000 being placed on nonaccrual of which $1,747,000 was one commercial relationship. In cases where there is a collateral shortfall on non-accrual loans, specific impairment reserves have been established based on updated collateral values even if the borrower continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Of the total amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018, $3,072,000, or approximately 41% of the loans classified as non-accrual, are current or past due less than 30 days.\n- 40 -\nQNB had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2018 or at December 31, 2017. Total loans that are 30 days or more past due increased $1,722,000 to $5,941,000, representing 0.76% of total loans at December 31, 2018 compared with 0.58% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Restructured loans, as defined in accounting guidance for troubled debt restructuring in ASC 310-40, that have not already been included in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing or in non-accrual loans, totaled $2,160,000 and $1,321,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nQNB held no OREO at December 31, 2018 or 2017. There were no repossessed assets as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\n\nAdditional loan quality information can be found in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management's view is that loans classified as substandard or doubtful that are not included in the past due, non-accrual or restructured categories are potential problem loans. For some of these loans, management may have knowledge of possible credit problems that will cause management to question the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Commercial loans classified as substandard or doubtful, which includes non-performing loans, continue to show improvement. At December 31, 2018, substandard or doubtful loans totaled $18,339,000, an increase of $1,692,000, or 10.2%, from the $16,647,000, reported as of December 31, 2017.\n- 41 -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The determination of an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an analysis of the risks inherent in QNB's loan portfolio. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, makes significant estimates and assumptions. Since the allowance for loan losses is dependent on conditions that may be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for losses on loans. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance.\nManagement closely monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and performs a quarterly analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the level of unallocated reserves. This analysis considers a number of relevant factors including: specific impairment reserves, historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions, levels of and trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, levels of classified loans, trends in the growth rate of loans and concentrations of credit.\nEconomic conditions, nationally and in QNB's market, continued to improve in 2018, and asset quality remained strong. The allowance level stated as a percent of loans receivable increased from 1.07% at December 31, 2017 to 1.12% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses increased to $8,834,000 at year-end 2018 from $7,841,000 at year-end 2017, primarily due to the increase in loans receivable over the same period.\n\nGross loans represent loans before unamortized net loan fees and costs. Percent gross loans lists the percentage of each loan type to total loans.\nA loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that QNB will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls may not be classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been identified totaled $16,482,000 and $13,584,000, respectively, of which $11,763,000 and $11,125,000, respectively, required no specific allowance for loan loss. The recorded investment in impaired loans requiring an allowance for loan losses was $4,719,000 and $2,459,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related allowance for loan losses associated with these loans was $1,664,000 and $1,392,000, respectively. See Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional detail of impaired loans.\n- 42 -\n\nQNB had net loan charge-offs of $137,000, or 0.02% of average loans for 2018 compared with $953,000, or 0.14% of average loans for 2017 and $190,000, or 0.03% of average loans for 2016. The majority of charge-offs recorded during these periods had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loan. The increase in commercial and industrial charge-offs in 2017 is primarily related to a single credit.\n- 43 -\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses of $8,834,000 is adequate as of December 31, 2018, in relation to the estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio.\nPremises and equipment\nPremises and equipment, net of depreciation increased $1,423,000 to $9,918,000 at December 31, 2018, Building improvement and other purchases more than offset depreciation during 2018.\nOther assets\nOther assets, as presented in the table on Page 34, increased $395,000 from $6,584,000 at December 31, 2017 to $6,979,000 at December 31, 2018. Most of the increase in other assets relates to a $405,000 increase to the deferred tax asset resulting from the fair value adjustment on investment securities available-for-sale of $641,000 partially offset by the deferred tax liability on deferred loan costs of $361,000. The detail of the net deferred tax asset can be found in Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIABILITIES\nThe following table presents total liabilities at the dates indicated:\n\nDeposits\nQNB primarily attracts deposits from within its market area by offering various deposit products. These deposits are in the form of time deposits, which include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts ( IRA\u201ds) which have a stated maturity, and non-maturity deposit accounts, which include: non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts.\nTotal deposits increased $21,650,000, or 2.2%, to $1,015,598,000 at December 31, 2018. This follows an increase of $80,593,000, or 8.8%, between 2016 and 2017. QNB has experienced growth in part due to market disruption created by bank mergers in its footprint throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. The growth in deposits as well as the mix of deposits continues to be impacted by customers' reactions to the competition, regulations and the interest rate environment. Many customers are looking for transaction accounts that provide liquidity and pay a reasonable amount of interest. Time deposit balances declined slightly. Customers appear to be looking for the safety of FDIC insured deposits and the stability of a strong local community bank.\nNon-interest-bearing demand accounts decreased slightly by $597,000 to $128,615,000 at December 31, 2018. This followed growth of $10,202,000, or 8.6%, between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. These deposits are primarily comprised of business checking accounts and are volatile depending on the timing of deposits and withdrawals. QNB has been successful in attracting new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers, which provides an opportunity for fee income.\nInterest-bearing demand accounts, retail and business interest checking and municipal accounts increased $7,182,000, or 2.4%, to $304,652,000 at December 31, 2018. All segments experienced growth in 2018 except municipal accounts, which decreased $24,463,000. While QNB has been successful in developing relationships with several school districts and municipalities as well as expanding existing relationships, the balances in these accounts are seasonal in nature and can be volatile on a daily basis. Most of the school district taxes are collected during the third quarter of the year and are disbursed over a nine-month period. Business checking increased from $19,937,000 at December 31, 2017 to $41,991,000 at December 31, 2018. Rewards checking balances increased from $55,071,000 at December 31, 2017 to $57,621,000 at December 31, 2018, and Select 50 balances increased from $81,877,000 to $87,598,000 over this same period. Personal interest-bearing balances also increased from $22,421,000 at December 31, 2017 to $23,741,000 at December 31, 2018. QNB continues to open a significant number of new checking accounts.\nMoney Market accounts decreased from $84,562,000 at December 31, 2017 to $78,781,000 at December 31, 2018 due to decreases in both personal and business accounts.\n- 44 -\nTotal savings account balances increased $22,240,000, or 8.6%, to $279,762,000 at December 31, 2018. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the online eSavings account of $22,797,000, or 12.2%, to $208,993,000 at December 31, 2018. The rate on eSavings accounts was changed from 0.65% at the end of 2017 to 0.70% in March 2018, 0.75% in June 2018, 0.80% in September 2018 and to 0.85% in December 2018.\nTotal time deposit account balances were $223,788,000 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,394,000, or 0.6%, from the amount reported at December 31, 2017. As time deposits matured during the past two years, they were frequently reinvested in the high yielding and liquid Rewards or Select 50 checking, money market or eSavings accounts which, in many instances, paid a rate higher than what was offered on short-term time deposits.\n\nTo continue to attract and retain deposits, QNB plans to remain competitive with respect to rates and to continue to deliver products with terms and features that appeal to customers. The QNB Rewards checking and online eSavings accounts are examples of such products.\nThe following table presents trends in balances and yield on the major deposit groups.\n\nShort-term borrowings\nShort-term borrowings comprising commercial sweep accounts and overnight FHLB borrowings declined $4,884,000, or 8.8%, to $50,872,000 at December 31, 2018. Overnight FHLB borrowings declined $10,046,000, to $3,865,000 at December 31, 2018. Commercial sweeps increased $5,162,000, or 12.3%, to $47,007,000 at December 31, 2018.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities comprise accrued expenses including salaries, post-retirement life insurance benefits and income taxes, deferred revenue, and ATM/debit card processing clearing. This category increased $506,000 to $4,185,000 at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity represents an institution's ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. QNB attempts to manage its mix of cash and interest-bearing balances, Federal funds sold and investment securities to match the volatility, seasonality, interest sensitivity and growth trends of its loans and deposits. The Company manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. Liquidity is provided from asset sources through repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities. The portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale and QNB's policy of selling certain residential mortgage originations in the secondary market also provide sources of liquidity. Core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding source for QNB. These deposits and repurchase agreements are generated from a base of consumers, businesses and public funds primarily located in the Company's market area.\n- 45 -\nAn additional source of liquidity is provided by the Bank's membership in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $311,119,000, net of the $3,865,000 outstanding at year-end 2018 and $350,000 FHLB-issued letter of credit. The maximum borrowing capacity changes depending upon the Bank's level of qualifying collateral assets. QNB had $3,865,000 and $13,911,000 in FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Bank maintains four unsecured Federal funds lines with four correspondent banks totaling $46,000,000. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines. Future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn. As part of its contingency funding plan, QNB successfully tested its ability to borrow from these sources during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, equity and available-for-sale securities and loans held-for-sale totaled $367,100,000 at December 31, 2018 and $395,876,000 at December 31, 2017, of which $194,573,000 and $202,887,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and public deposits. This decrease in liquid sources is primarily the result of a $30,349,000 decrease in available-for-sale securities. Management anticipates that these liquid sources are adequate to meet normal fluctuations in loan demand or deposit withdrawals. It is anticipated that the investment portfolio will continue to provide sufficient liquidity as municipal bonds are called and as principal and interest payments on mortgage-backed and CMO securities provide steady cash flow. Increases in interest rates, however, result in decreased cash flow available from the investment portfolio.\nQNB is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services ( CDARS\u201d) program offered by the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. It enables financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on time deposits over $250,000 that are placed in the program. QNB also has available Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d), another program through Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC, which is a product similar to CDARS, but one that provides liquidity like a money market or savings account. QNB had $151,000 in CDARS time deposits at December 31, 2018.\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe following table presents total shareholders' equity at the dates indicated:\n\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $5,778,000, or 5.9%, to $104,348,000 at December 31, 2018 with retained earnings -- net income less dividends paid -- contributing $6,901,000 and the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan contributing $1,372,000.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $3,046,000; $2,495,000, resulting from the decrease in fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio due to increased interest rates at the end of 2018. QNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 202), in the first quarter of 2018 as discussed in Note 1. The implementation of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-02 resulted in reclasses within Shareholders Equity from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax\u201d to Retained earnings\u201d of a $254,000 net loss and a $805,000 net gain, respectively.\nQNB remains well capitalized\u201d based on FDIC requirements.\nCapital Adequacy\nA strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and profitability and to serve the needs of depositors. QNB's shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 was $104,348,000, or 8.88% of total assets, compared with shareholders' equity of $98,570,000, or 8.55% of total assets, at December 31, 2017. Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 included a negative adjustment of $7,132,000 related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available for sale. At December 31, 2017, shareholders' equity included a negative adjustment of $4,086,000, related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available-for-sale. Excluding these adjustments, shareholders' equity to total assets would have been 9.43% and 8.88% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n- 46 -\nAverage shareholders' equity and average total assets were $108,241,000 and $1,176,910,000 for 2018, an increase of 6.7% and 5.4%, respectively, from 2017 average equity and average total assets of $101,496,000 and $1,117,163,000, respectively. The ratio of average total equity to total average assets was 9.20% for 2018, compared with 9.09% for 2017.\nQNB is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to its shareholders pursuant to the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 as amended (the BCL). The BCL operates generally to preclude dividend payments, if the effect thereof would render QNB insolvent, as defined. As a practical matter, QNB's payment of dividends is contingent upon its ability to obtain funding in the form of dividends from the Bank. Under Pennsylvania banking law, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2018, the retained earnings of the Bank totaling $99,009,000 was available for dividends without prior Pennsylvania Department of Banking approval, subject to the regulatory capital requirements discussed below. The approval of the Federal Reserve is required for a state bank member in the Federal Reserve system to pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the Bank's net profits (as defined) for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the Bank can declare dividends in 2019 without approval of the Federal Reserve of approximately $17,365,000 plus an additional amount equal to the Bank's net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. QNB paid dividends to its shareholders of $1.28 per share, $1.24 per share, and $1.20 per share, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nQNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various weights to all assets and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and loan commitments, based on associated risk. QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III\u201d) became effective for QNB on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all the of final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nUnder the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banks. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented. The final rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. QNB and the Bank have enough capital to meet the buffer if it were fully phased in at December 31, 2018.\nQNB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan\u201d) to provide participants a convenient and economical method for investing cash dividends paid on the Company's common stock in additional shares at a discount. The Plan also allows participants to make additional cash purchases of stock at a discount. Stock purchases under the Plan contributed $979,000 and $973,000 to capital during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100,000 shares of QNB's common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not bear a termination date. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 57,883 shares were repurchased under this authorization at an average price of $16.97 and a total cost of $982,000. There were no shares repurchased under the plan since the first quarter of 2009.\n- 47 -\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 established five capital level designations ranging from well capitalized\u201d to critically undercapitalized.\u201d At December 31, 2018 and 2017, management believes that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and have met the well capitalized\u201d criteria.\n\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nQNB has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, which may require future cash payments.\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2018, significant contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $73,000 at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\n\n (a) Includes available amounts for overdraft protection program in one year or less \nCommitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The Company does not currently have any commitments for significant capital expenditures or other purchase obligations.\n- 48 -\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. QNB's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and liquidity risk. QNB's liquidity position was discussed in a prior section.\nQNB's largest source of revenue is net interest income, which is subject to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins and interest rate spreads and to provide growth in net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. QNB's Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is responsible for managing interest rate risk and for evaluating the impact of changing interest rate conditions on net interest income.\nQNB uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation considers current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates assumptions for growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when its liabilities (deposits and borrowings) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its earning assets (loans and securities). A liability sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively less net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when they decline. Based on our simulation analysis, management believes QNB's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2018 is liability sensitive. Management expects that market interest rates may gradually increase in the next 12 months, based on the economic environment and policy of the Federal Reserve.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 assuming instantaneous rate shocks, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the subsequent twelve months is projected to decrease when interest rates are higher than current rates.\n\nComputations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect QNB's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nQNB is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. At December 31, 2018, QNB did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\n- 49 -\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nDisclosure of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the most sensitive of these issues. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of QNB, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires QNB to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. QNB evaluates estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the determination of the valuation of other real estate owned, other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities, the determination of impairment of restricted bank stock, the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. QNB bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment\nSecurities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. For equity securities, once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the equity security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320-10 as it relates to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). This accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not, the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held to maturity debt securities, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the non-credit portion of a previous other-than-temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nQNB considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable known and inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio. The allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses. The provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered necessary by management.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on management's continual review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance is determined by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves to all other loans. The portion of the allowance that is allocated to impaired loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral. The general reserves are based on the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the loan portfolio, credit concentration trends, delinquency and loss experience, as well as other qualitative factors such as current economic trends.\nManagement emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits. Credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio. QNB's lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower's circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral. A loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of collection. Each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower's financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan. An independent loan review group tests risk assessments and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management meets monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and quarterly to review the allowance for loan losses.\n- 50 -\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. If circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, increases to the allowance may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.\nForeclosed Assets\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2018, QNB sponsored stock-based compensation plans, administered by a Board committee, under which both qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted periodically to certain employees. QNB accounts for all awards granted under stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date. QNB estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature.\nIncome Taxes\nQNB accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method in accordance with income tax accounting guidance, ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available. Because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may, at least in part, be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term.", "item_7_tables": "Table 68: <table> <tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td>
