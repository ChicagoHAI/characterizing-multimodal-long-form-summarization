MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nItem 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ( Mastercard International\u201d) (together, Mastercard\u201d or the Company\u201d), included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBusiness Overview\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including Mastercard\u00ae, Maestro\u00ae and Cirrus\u00ae. We operate a multi-rail network that offers customers one partner to turn to for their domestic and cross-border payment needs. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, which we refer to as our core network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions and deliver related products and services. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house ( ACH\u201d) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). We also provide integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs, processing and open banking. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.\nA typical transaction on our core network involves four participants in addition to us: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution). We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\nCOVID-19\nThe coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe and has had significant negative effects on the global economy. This outbreak has affected business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce. We continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic and actions taken by governments as they relate to travel restrictions, social distancing measures and restrictions on business operations, as well as the continued impact of these actions on consumers and businesses. While some of these measures have eased in certain jurisdictions, others have remained in place. The extent to which current measures are removed or new measures are put in place will depend upon how the pandemic evolves, as well as the progress of the global roll-out of vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak affected our 2020 performance, during which we noted unfavorable trends compared to historical periods. The following table provides a summary of trends in our key metrics for 2020 as compared to the respective periods in 2019:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quarter ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross dollar volume (local currency basis) </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-border volume (local currency basis) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(45) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(36) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switched transactions </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of this outbreak started in the first quarter of 2020 as we experienced declines in our key metrics compared to historical periods, primarily due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders implemented by governments in many regions and countries across the globe. Our key metrics continued to be impacted throughout 2020 as follows:\n\u2022Gross dollar volumes were flat in 2020 as compared to 2019, recovering gradually in the second half of the year from a decline during the second quarter in part due to the global relaxation of both restrictions on business operations and social distancing measures.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 41\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022Cross-border volumes were negatively impacted by the pandemic during 2020 due to a significant decrease in global travel as a result of compliance with travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. While cross-border volumes are still lower compared to prior year periods, these volumes have improved throughout the second half of 2020.\n\u2022Switched transactions were negatively impacted by the pandemic primarily in the second quarter. Subsequently, switched transactions improved during the third quarter in part due to the global relaxation of both restrictions on business operations and social distancing measures. During the fourth quarter, switched transactions growth slowed slightly as compared to the third quarter.\nThe full extent to which the pandemic, and measures taken in response, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\nIncrease/\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019\nIncrease/\n(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in millions, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16)% </td> <td> </td> <td>33% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>48.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) ppt </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 ppt </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16)% </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 ppt </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) ppt </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> <td> </td> <td>39% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20)% </td> <td> </td> <td>42% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>1,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a summary of our key non-GAAP operating results1, adjusted to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, special items (which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items) and the related tax impacts on our non-GAAP adjustments.

Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts ( Special Items\u201d). Starting in 2019, our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which primarily includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts. The 2018 amounts were not restated, as the impact of the change was immaterial in relation to our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n\u2022During 2020 and 2019, we recorded net gains of $30 million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) and $167 million ($124 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share), respectively. The net gains were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 43\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSpecial Items\nLitigation provisions\n\u2022During 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $73 million ($67 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which included pre-tax charges of:\n\u25e6$45 million related to an ongoing confidential legal matter associated with our prepaid cards in the U.K., and\n\u25e6$28 million related to estimated attorneys' fees and litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n\u2022During 2018, we recorded pre-tax charges of $1,128 million ($1,008 million after tax, or $0.96 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which included pre-tax charges of:\n\u25e6$654 million related to a fine issued by the European Commission,\n\u25e6$237 million related to both the U.S. merchant class litigation and the filed and anticipated opt-out U.S. merchant cases, and\n\u25e6$237 million related to litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\nTax act\n\u2022During 2019, we recorded a $57 million net tax benefit ($0.06 per diluted share), which included a $30 million benefit related to a reduction to the 2017 one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings (the Transition Tax\u201d) resulting from final tax regulations issued in 2019 and a $27 million benefit related to additional foreign tax credits which can be carried back under transition rules.\n\u2022During 2018, we recorded a $75 million net tax benefit ($0.07 per diluted share), which included a $90 million benefit related to the carryback of foreign tax credits due to transition rules, offset by a net $15 million expense primarily related to an increase to our Transition Tax.\nSee Note 7 (Investments), Note 20 (Income Taxes) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.\nWe believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.\nIn addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. We believe the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.\nNet revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n44 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

The 2018 period was not restated as the impact of the change was immaterial in relation to our non-GAAP results.\n2Represents the translational and transactional impact of currency.\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to the financial measures described above in Financial Results Overview\u201d, we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\nGross Dollar Volume ( GDV\u201d)1 measures dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. Dollar volume represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume\u201d means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume\u201d means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.\nCross-border Volume2 measures cross-border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.\n46 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSwitched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard. We define transactions switched as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.\nOperating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard's transaction switching systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard's customers.\n2 Normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods. Carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where the company does not clear and settle are processed.\nForeign Currency\nCurrency Impact\nOur primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian real and the British pound. Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ( GDV\u201d) and gross euro volume ( GEV\u201d), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives. In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, certain of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The currency transactional impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. In 2020, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis decreased 2.0%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 0.1% versus 2019. In 2019, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 9.8%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 13.1% versus 2018. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\nThe translational and transactional impact of currency ( Currency impact\u201d) has been identified in our drivers of change tables and has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates, which are non-GAAP financial measures. See Financial Results - Revenue and Operating Expenses\u201d for our drivers of change impact tables and Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments.\n2021 Hedge Accounting Designation\nThrough December 31, 2020, our approach to manage our transactional currency exposure consisted of hedging a portion of anticipated revenues impacted by transactional currencies by entering into foreign exchange derivative contracts, and recording the related changes in fair value in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Beginning in January 2021, we started to formally designate certain newly-executed foreign exchange derivative contracts, which meet the established accounting criteria, as cash flow hedges. Starting in the first quarter of 2021, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these designated contracts will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in the respective component of net revenue when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. The related impact of our foreign exchange cash flow hedging activities will be excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates as part of our Currency impact.\nForeign Exchange Activity\nWe incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement receivables and payables with our customers, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 47\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nadministrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of foreign exchange activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRisk of Currency Devaluation\nWe are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into U.S. dollars. While these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nPrimary drivers of net revenue, versus the prior year, were as follows:\nGross revenue decreased 5%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by decreased cross-border volumes reflecting impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, partially offset by increases in our value-added products and services and the number of switched transactions. Gross dollar volume of $6.3 trillion was flat.\nRebates and incentives increased 3%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, due to new and renewed deals partially offset by a favorable mix of volume-based incentives.\nNet revenue decreased 9%, or 8% on a currency-neutral basis, including 1 percentage point of growth from our acquisitions.\nSee Note 3 (Revenue) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a further discussion of how we recognize revenue.\nThe components of net revenue were as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic assessments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-border volume fees </td> <td> </td> <td>3,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37)% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction processing </td> <td> </td> <td>8,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>4,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>23% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>23,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rebates and incentives (contra-revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,315) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,097) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,881) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n48 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were flat in 2020 versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 1% on both an as adjusted and a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year. Current year results include growth of approximately 4 percentage points from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, expenses declined 5% primarily due to reduced spending on advertising and marketing, travel and professional fees, partially offset by higher personnel and data processing costs to support continued investment in our strategic initiatives.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 49\nPART II\nITEM 7.

This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nCash Flow\nThe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,879) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,640) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(506) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,152) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,966) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease in litigation payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $239 million in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net proceeds from our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, partially offset by higher prior year acquisition payments.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $3.7 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower repurchases of our Class A common stock, higher net debt proceeds in the current period and the repayment of debt that matured in the prior year.\n52 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDebt and Credit Availability\nIn March 2020, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due March 2027, $1.5 billion principal amount of notes due March 2030 and $1.5 billion principal amount notes due March 2050. Our total debt outstanding was $12.7 billion at December 31, 2020, with the earliest maturity of $650 million of principal occurring in November 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have a commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program\u201d), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) which, in 2020, was extended for an additional year and now expires in November 2025.\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.\nThe following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividend, per share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividends paid </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 8, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share paid on February 9, 2021 to holders of record on January 8, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $439 million.\nOn February 8, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share payable on May 7, 2021 to holders of record on April 9, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $437 million.\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. In December 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to $6.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of our Class A common stock. The program approved in 2020 will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions. The following table summarizes our share repurchase activity of our Class A common stock through December 31, 2020, under the plans approved in 2019 and 2018:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining authorization at December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar-value of shares repurchased in 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining authorization at December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased in 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price paid per share in 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>312.68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 16 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 53\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRevenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\nWe enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates or support when customers meet certain volume thresholds as well as other support incentives, which are tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. If our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.\nIncome Taxes\nIn calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income including, projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.\nWe record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.\nDeferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred. Ultimately, the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition purchase price, including contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization\n54 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nexpense. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques included comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management's judgment. The significance of management's estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nItem 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ( Mastercard International\u201d) (together, Mastercard\u201d or the Company\u201d), included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBusiness Overview\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including Mastercard\u00ae, Maestro\u00ae and Cirrus\u00ae. We operate a multi-rail network that offers customers one partner to turn to for their domestic and cross-border payment needs. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, which we refer to as our core network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions and deliver related products and services. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house ( ACH\u201d) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). We also provide integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs, processing and open banking. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.\nA typical transaction on our core network involves four participants in addition to us: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution). We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\nCOVID-19\nThe coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe and has had significant negative effects on the global economy. This outbreak has affected business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce. We continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic and actions taken by governments as they relate to travel restrictions, social distancing measures and restrictions on business operations, as well as the continued impact of these actions on consumers and businesses. While some of these measures have eased in certain jurisdictions, others have remained in place. The extent to which current measures are removed or new measures are put in place will depend upon how the pandemic evolves, as well as the progress of the global roll-out of vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak affected our 2020 performance, during which we noted unfavorable trends compared to historical periods. The following table provides a summary of trends in our key metrics for 2020 as compared to the respective periods in 2019:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quarter ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross dollar volume (local currency basis) </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-border volume (local currency basis) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(45) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(36) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switched transactions </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of this outbreak started in the first quarter of 2020 as we experienced declines in our key metrics compared to historical periods, primarily due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders implemented by governments in many regions and countries across the globe. Our key metrics continued to be impacted throughout 2020 as follows:\n\u2022Gross dollar volumes were flat in 2020 as compared to 2019, recovering gradually in the second half of the year from a decline during the second quarter in part due to the global relaxation of both restrictions on business operations and social distancing measures.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 41\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022Cross-border volumes were negatively impacted by the pandemic during 2020 due to a significant decrease in global travel as a result of compliance with travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. While cross-border volumes are still lower compared to prior year periods, these volumes have improved throughout the second half of 2020.\n\u2022Switched transactions were negatively impacted by the pandemic primarily in the second quarter. Subsequently, switched transactions improved during the third quarter in part due to the global relaxation of both restrictions on business operations and social distancing measures. During the fourth quarter, switched transactions growth slowed slightly as compared to the third quarter.\nThe full extent to which the pandemic, and measures taken in response, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\nIncrease/\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019\nIncrease/\n(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in millions, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16)% </td> <td> </td> <td>33% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>48.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) ppt </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 ppt </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16)% </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 ppt </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) ppt </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> <td> </td> <td>39% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20)% </td> <td> </td> <td>42% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>1,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a summary of our key non-GAAP operating results1, adjusted to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, special items (which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items) and the related tax impacts on our non-GAAP adjustments.

Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts ( Special Items\u201d). Starting in 2019, our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which primarily includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts. The 2018 amounts were not restated, as the impact of the change was immaterial in relation to our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n\u2022During 2020 and 2019, we recorded net gains of $30 million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) and $167 million ($124 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share), respectively. The net gains were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 43\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSpecial Items\nLitigation provisions\n\u2022During 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $73 million ($67 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which included pre-tax charges of:\n\u25e6$45 million related to an ongoing confidential legal matter associated with our prepaid cards in the U.K., and\n\u25e6$28 million related to estimated attorneys' fees and litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n\u2022During 2018, we recorded pre-tax charges of $1,128 million ($1,008 million after tax, or $0.96 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which included pre-tax charges of:\n\u25e6$654 million related to a fine issued by the European Commission,\n\u25e6$237 million related to both the U.S. merchant class litigation and the filed and anticipated opt-out U.S. merchant cases, and\n\u25e6$237 million related to litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\nTax act\n\u2022During 2019, we recorded a $57 million net tax benefit ($0.06 per diluted share), which included a $30 million benefit related to a reduction to the 2017 one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings (the Transition Tax\u201d) resulting from final tax regulations issued in 2019 and a $27 million benefit related to additional foreign tax credits which can be carried back under transition rules.\n\u2022During 2018, we recorded a $75 million net tax benefit ($0.07 per diluted share), which included a $90 million benefit related to the carryback of foreign tax credits due to transition rules, offset by a net $15 million expense primarily related to an increase to our Transition Tax.\nSee Note 7 (Investments), Note 20 (Income Taxes) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.\nWe believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.\nIn addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. We believe the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.\nNet revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n44 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

The 2018 period was not restated as the impact of the change was immaterial in relation to our non-GAAP results.\n2Represents the translational and transactional impact of currency.\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to the financial measures described above in Financial Results Overview\u201d, we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\nGross Dollar Volume ( GDV\u201d)1 measures dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. Dollar volume represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume\u201d means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume\u201d means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.\nCross-border Volume2 measures cross-border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.\n46 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSwitched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard. We define transactions switched as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.\nOperating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard's transaction switching systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard's customers.\n2 Normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods. Carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where the company does not clear and settle are processed.\nForeign Currency\nCurrency Impact\nOur primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian real and the British pound. Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ( GDV\u201d) and gross euro volume ( GEV\u201d), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives. In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, certain of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The currency transactional impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. In 2020, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis decreased 2.0%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 0.1% versus 2019. In 2019, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 9.8%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 13.1% versus 2018. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\nThe translational and transactional impact of currency ( Currency impact\u201d) has been identified in our drivers of change tables and has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates, which are non-GAAP financial measures. See Financial Results - Revenue and Operating Expenses\u201d for our drivers of change impact tables and Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments.\n2021 Hedge Accounting Designation\nThrough December 31, 2020, our approach to manage our transactional currency exposure consisted of hedging a portion of anticipated revenues impacted by transactional currencies by entering into foreign exchange derivative contracts, and recording the related changes in fair value in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Beginning in January 2021, we started to formally designate certain newly-executed foreign exchange derivative contracts, which meet the established accounting criteria, as cash flow hedges. Starting in the first quarter of 2021, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these designated contracts will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in the respective component of net revenue when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. The related impact of our foreign exchange cash flow hedging activities will be excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates as part of our Currency impact.\nForeign Exchange Activity\nWe incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement receivables and payables with our customers, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 47\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nadministrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of foreign exchange activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRisk of Currency Devaluation\nWe are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into U.S. dollars. While these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nPrimary drivers of net revenue, versus the prior year, were as follows:\nGross revenue decreased 5%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by decreased cross-border volumes reflecting impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, partially offset by increases in our value-added products and services and the number of switched transactions. Gross dollar volume of $6.3 trillion was flat.\nRebates and incentives increased 3%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, due to new and renewed deals partially offset by a favorable mix of volume-based incentives.\nNet revenue decreased 9%, or 8% on a currency-neutral basis, including 1 percentage point of growth from our acquisitions.\nSee Note 3 (Revenue) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a further discussion of how we recognize revenue.\nThe components of net revenue were as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic assessments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-border volume fees </td> <td> </td> <td>3,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37)% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction processing </td> <td> </td> <td>8,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>4,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>23% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>23,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rebates and incentives (contra-revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,315) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,097) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,881) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n48 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

Adjusted operating expenses decreased 1% on both an as adjusted and a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year. Current year results include growth of approximately 4 percentage points from acquisitions.

We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nCash Flow\nThe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,879) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,640) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(506) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,152) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,966) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease in litigation payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $239 million in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net proceeds from our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, partially offset by higher prior year acquisition payments.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $3.7 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower repurchases of our Class A common stock, higher net debt proceeds in the current period and the repayment of debt that matured in the prior year.\n52 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

Our total debt outstanding was $12.7 billion at December 31, 2020, with the earliest maturity of $650 million of principal occurring in November 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have a commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program\u201d), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) which, in 2020, was extended for an additional year and now expires in November 2025.\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.\nThe following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividend, per share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividends paid </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 8, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share paid on February 9, 2021 to holders of record on January 8, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $437 million.\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. In December 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to $6.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of our Class A common stock. The program approved in 2020 will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions.

Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRevenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\nWe enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates or support when customers meet certain volume thresholds as well as other support incentives, which are tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. If our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.\nIncome Taxes\nIn calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income including, projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.\nWe record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.\nDeferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred. Ultimately, the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition purchase price, including contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization\n54 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nexpense. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques included comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management's judgment. The significance of management's estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nItem 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ( Mastercard International\u201d) (together, Mastercard\u201d or the Company\u201d), included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBusiness Overview\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including Mastercard\u00ae, Maestro\u00ae and Cirrus\u00ae. We operate a multi-rail network that offers customers one partner to turn to for their domestic and cross-border payment needs. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, which we refer to as our core network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions and deliver related products and services. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house ( ACH\u201d) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). We also provide integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs, processing and open banking. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.\nA typical transaction on our core network involves four participants in addition to us: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution). We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\nCOVID-19\nThe coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe and has had significant negative effects on the global economy. This outbreak has affected business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce. We continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic and actions taken by governments as they relate to travel restrictions, social distancing measures and restrictions on business operations, as well as the continued impact of these actions on consumers and businesses. While some of these measures have eased in certain jurisdictions, others have remained in place. The extent to which current measures are removed or new measures are put in place will depend upon how the pandemic evolves, as well as the progress of the global roll-out of vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak affected our 2020 performance, during which we noted unfavorable trends compared to historical periods. The following table provides a summary of trends in our key metrics for 2020 as compared to the respective periods in 2019:\n\nThe impact of this outbreak started in the first quarter of 2020 as we experienced declines in our key metrics compared to historical periods, primarily due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders implemented by governments in many regions and countries across the globe. Our key metrics continued to be impacted throughout 2020 as follows:\n\u2022Gross dollar volumes were flat in 2020 as compared to 2019, recovering gradually in the second half of the year from a decline during the second quarter in part due to the global relaxation of both restrictions on business operations and social distancing measures.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 41\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022Cross-border volumes were negatively impacted by the pandemic during 2020 due to a significant decrease in global travel as a result of compliance with travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. While cross-border volumes are still lower compared to prior year periods, these volumes have improved throughout the second half of 2020.\n\u2022Switched transactions were negatively impacted by the pandemic primarily in the second quarter. Subsequently, switched transactions improved during the third quarter in part due to the global relaxation of both restrictions on business operations and social distancing measures. During the fourth quarter, switched transactions growth slowed slightly as compared to the third quarter.\nThe full extent to which the pandemic, and measures taken in response, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported:\n\nThe following table provides a summary of our key non-GAAP operating results1, adjusted to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, special items (which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items) and the related tax impacts on our non-GAAP adjustments. In addition, we have presented growth rates, adjusted for the impact of currency:\n\nNote: Tables may not sum due to rounding.\n1 See Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments and the reconciliation to GAAP reported amounts.\n42 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nKey highlights for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows:\n\n\n\nOther 2020 financial highlights were as follows:\n\u2022We generated net cash flows from operations of $7.2 billion.\n\u2022We completed the acquisitions of businesses for total consideration of $1.1 billion.\n\u2022We repurchased 14.3 million shares of our common stock for $4.5 billion and paid dividends of $1.6 billion.\n\u2022We completed debt offerings for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company's performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts ( Special Items\u201d). Starting in 2019, our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which primarily includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts. The 2018 amounts were not restated, as the impact of the change was immaterial in relation to our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n\u2022During 2020 and 2019, we recorded net gains of $30 million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) and $167 million ($124 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share), respectively. The net gains were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 43\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSpecial Items\nLitigation provisions\n\u2022During 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $73 million ($67 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which included pre-tax charges of:\n\u25e6$45 million related to an ongoing confidential legal matter associated with our prepaid cards in the U.K., and\n\u25e6$28 million related to estimated attorneys' fees and litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n\u2022During 2018, we recorded pre-tax charges of $1,128 million ($1,008 million after tax, or $0.96 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which included pre-tax charges of:\n\u25e6$654 million related to a fine issued by the European Commission,\n\u25e6$237 million related to both the U.S. merchant class litigation and the filed and anticipated opt-out U.S. merchant cases, and\n\u25e6$237 million related to litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\nTax act\n\u2022During 2019, we recorded a $57 million net tax benefit ($0.06 per diluted share), which included a $30 million benefit related to a reduction to the 2017 one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings (the Transition Tax\u201d) resulting from final tax regulations issued in 2019 and a $27 million benefit related to additional foreign tax credits which can be carried back under transition rules.\n\u2022During 2018, we recorded a $75 million net tax benefit ($0.07 per diluted share), which included a $90 million benefit related to the carryback of foreign tax credits due to transition rules, offset by a net $15 million expense primarily related to an increase to our Transition Tax.\nSee Note 7 (Investments), Note 20 (Income Taxes) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.\nWe believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.\nIn addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. We believe the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.\nNet revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n44 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\nGross Dollar Volume ( GDV\u201d)1 measures dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. Dollar volume represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume\u201d means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume\u201d means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.\nCross-border Volume2 measures cross-border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.\n46 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSwitched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard. We define transactions switched as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.\nOperating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard's transaction switching systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard's customers.\n2 Normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods. Carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where the company does not clear and settle are processed.\nForeign Currency\nCurrency Impact\nOur primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian real and the British pound. Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ( GDV\u201d) and gross euro volume ( GEV\u201d), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives. In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, certain of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The currency transactional impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. In 2020, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis decreased 2.0%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 0.1% versus 2019. In 2019, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 9.8%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 13.1% versus 2018. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\nThe translational and transactional impact of currency ( Currency impact\u201d) has been identified in our drivers of change tables and has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates, which are non-GAAP financial measures. See Financial Results - Revenue and Operating Expenses\u201d for our drivers of change impact tables and Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments.\n2021 Hedge Accounting Designation\nThrough December 31, 2020, our approach to manage our transactional currency exposure consisted of hedging a portion of anticipated revenues impacted by transactional currencies by entering into foreign exchange derivative contracts, and recording the related changes in fair value in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Beginning in January 2021, we started to formally designate certain newly-executed foreign exchange derivative contracts, which meet the established accounting criteria, as cash flow hedges. Starting in the first quarter of 2021, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these designated contracts will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in the respective component of net revenue when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. The related impact of our foreign exchange cash flow hedging activities will be excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates as part of our Currency impact.\nForeign Exchange Activity\nWe incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement receivables and payables with our customers, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 47\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nadministrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of foreign exchange activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRisk of Currency Devaluation\nWe are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into U.S. dollars. While these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nPrimary drivers of net revenue, versus the prior year, were as follows:\nGross revenue decreased 5%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by decreased cross-border volumes reflecting impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, partially offset by increases in our value-added products and services and the number of switched transactions. Gross dollar volume of $6.3 trillion was flat.\nRebates and incentives increased 3%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, due to new and renewed deals partially offset by a favorable mix of volume-based incentives.\nNet revenue decreased 9%, or 8% on a currency-neutral basis, including 1 percentage point of growth from our acquisitions.\nSee Note 3 (Revenue) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a further discussion of how we recognize revenue.\nThe components of net revenue were as follows:\n\n48 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

A significant portion of our net revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2020, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $3.4 billion, or 22%, of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were flat in 2020 versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 1% on both an as adjusted and a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year. Current year results include growth of approximately 4 percentage points from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, expenses declined 5% primarily due to reduced spending on advertising and marketing, travel and professional fees, partially offset by higher personnel and data processing costs to support continued investment in our strategic initiatives.\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 49\nPART II\nITEM 7.

See Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nAdvertising and Marketing\nAdvertising and marketing expenses decreased 30%, or 29% on a currency-neutral basis in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower advertising and sponsorship spend in response to COVID-19.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased 11% on both an as reported and a currency-neutral basis in 2020 versus the prior year. Current year results include growth of approximately 6 percentage points from acquisitions. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from capital investments.\nProvision for Litigation\nIn 2020, we recorded $73 million related to various litigation settlements and legal costs. There were no litigation charges in the prior year. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) was unfavorable in 2020 versus the prior year primarily due to increased interest expense related to our recent debt issuances, as well as lower net gains in the current year versus the prior year related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities and a decrease in our investment income.\nThe components of other income (expense) were as follows:\n\nNote: Table may not sum due to rounding.\n** Not meaningful\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 17.4% and 16.6%, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2020 was higher than the prior year, primarily due to discrete tax benefits in 2019, partially offset by a more\nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 51\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nfavorable geographic mix of earnings in 2020. The 2019 discrete tax benefits related to a favorable court ruling, a reduction to the Company's transition tax liability and additional foreign tax credits which can be carried back under U.S tax reform transition rules issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe adjusted effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 17.2% and 17.0%, respectively. The adjusted effective income tax rate was higher than the prior year, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to a favorable court ruling in 2019.\nSee Note 20 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at December 31:\n\n1Investments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nCash Flow\nThe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease in litigation payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $239 million in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net proceeds from our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, partially offset by higher prior year acquisition payments.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $3.7 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower repurchases of our Class A common stock, higher net debt proceeds in the current period and the repayment of debt that matured in the prior year.\n52 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDebt and Credit Availability\nIn March 2020, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due March 2027, $1.5 billion principal amount of notes due March 2030 and $1.5 billion principal amount notes due March 2050. Our total debt outstanding was $12.7 billion at December 31, 2020, with the earliest maturity of $650 million of principal occurring in November 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have a commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program\u201d), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) which, in 2020, was extended for an additional year and now expires in November 2025.\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.\nThe following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:\n\nOn December 8, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share paid on February 9, 2021 to holders of record on January 8, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $439 million.\nOn February 8, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share payable on May 7, 2021 to holders of record on April 9, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $437 million.\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. In December 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to $6.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of our Class A common stock. The program approved in 2020 will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions. The following table summarizes our share repurchase activity of our Class A common stock through December 31, 2020, under the plans approved in 2019 and 2018:\n\nSee Note 16 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\n \nMASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K 53\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRevenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\nWe enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates or support when customers meet certain volume thresholds as well as other support incentives, which are tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. If our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.\nIncome Taxes\nIn calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income including, projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.\nWe record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.\nDeferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred. Ultimately, the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition purchase price, including contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization\n54 MASTERCARD 2020 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nexpense. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques included comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management's judgment. The significance of management's estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.", "item_7_tables": "Table 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Net revenue decreased 9% (8% currency-neutral) in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the impact of COVID-19, including a 29% decline in cross-border volumes. This was partially offset by growth in switched transactions (3%) and other revenues (14%).\n\n- Operating expenses were flat in 2020 compared to 2019. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 1% (currency-neutral) including 4 percentage points of growth from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, expenses declined 5% due to reduced spending on advertising, travel and professional fees. \n\n- Operating margin was 52.8% in 2020 versus 57.2% in 2019. Adjusted operating margin was 53.3% in 2020 versus 57.2% in 2019.\n\n- Other income (expense) was unfavorable in 2020 primarily due to increased interest expense and lower gains on investments.\n\n- The effective tax rate was 17.4% in 2020 versus 16.6% in 2019. The adjusted effective tax rate was 17.2% in 2020 versus 17.0% in 2019.\n\n- Net income decreased 21% and adjusted net income decreased 19% (17% currency-neutral) in 2020 versus 2019.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $7.2 billion in 2020. The company returned capital through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nIn summary, Mastercard's financial performance in 2020 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, especially on cross-border volumes, but the company continued to invest in strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth."}
