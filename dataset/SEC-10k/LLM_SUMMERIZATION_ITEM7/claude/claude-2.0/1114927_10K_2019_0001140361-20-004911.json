For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of changes in results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the Company and its subsidiary, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2019.\nOur subsidiary, First Northern Bank of Dixon, is a California state-chartered bank that derives most of its revenues from lending and deposit taking in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California. Interest rates, business conditions and customer confidence all affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition, the regulatory environment and competition can challenge our ability to generate those revenues.\nFinancial highlights for 2019 include:\nThe Company reported net income of $14.7 million for 2019, a 17.3% increase compared to net income of $12.6 million for 2018. Net income per common share for 2019 was $1.15, an increase of 16.2% compared to net income per common share of $0.99 for 2018. Net income per common share on a fully diluted basis was $1.14 for 2019, an increase of 17.5% compared to net income per common share on a fully diluted basis of $0.97 for 2018.\nNet interest income totaled $47.1 million for 2019, an increase of 6.3% from $44.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased average loan volumes and rates, increased investment securities volumes and rates, increased rates on interest bearing due from banks, increased average certificates of deposit volumes and rates, which was partially offset by decreased average due from banks volume and increased average interest-bearing transaction, savings and money market account volumes and rates.\nThere was no provision for loan losses in 2019 compared to provision for loan loss of $2.1 million in 2018. Net charge-offs were $466 thousand in 2019 compared to $411 thousand in 2018. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to limited loan growth coupled with improvements in credit quality and decreased non-performing assets and associated specific reserves.\nNon-interest income totaled $7.2 million for each of the periods ended in 2019 and 2018. Gain on sale of loans held-for sale and mortgage brokerage income increased in 2019 compared to 2018, which was partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $33.9 million for 2019, up 5.5% from $32.2 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits due to increased staffing levels, occupancy and equipment expense due to the opening of an administrative office space and a branch in the second half of 2019, data processing expenses as a result of enhanced IT infrastructure and outsourcing of core processing and other real estate owned expense primarily due to a write-down on other real estate owned. The increase in non-interest expenses was partially offset by a reversal of FDIC assessments expense due to the receipt of credits applied in the second half of 2019.\nThe Company reported total assets of $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 3.4% from $1.25 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nInvestments increased to $342.9 million as of December 31, 2019, a 9.0% increase from $314.6 million as of December 31, 2018. U.S. Treasury securities totaled $43.3 million as of December 31, 2019, down 14.7% from $50.7 million as of December 31, 2018; securities of U.S. government agencies and corporations totaled $53.9 million, up 28.1% from $42.1 million as of December 31, 2018; obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled $27.0 million, up 41.0% from $19.2 million as of December 31, 2018; collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $79.4 million, up 24.5% from $63.8 million as of December 31, 2018; and mortgage-backed securities totaled $139.3 million, up 0.3% from $138.9 million as of December 31, 2018.\nLoans (including loans held-for-sale), net of allowance, increased to $773.0 million as of December 31, 2019, a 1.0% increase from $765.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Commercial loans totaled $106.1 million as of December 31, 2019, down 15.2% from $125.2 million as of December 31, 2018; commercial real estate loans were $451.8 million, up 7.5% from $420.1 million as of December 31, 2018; agriculture loans were $115.8 million, down 6.4% from $123.6 million as of December 31, 2018; residential mortgage loans were $64.9 million, up 27.2% from $51.1 million as of December 31, 2018; residential construction loans were $15.2 million, down 24.4% from $20.1 million as of December 31, 2018; and consumer loans totaled $26.8 million, down 24.2% from $35.4 million as of December 31, 2018.\nDeposits increased to $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2019, a 1.3% increase from $1.12 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nStockholders' equity increased to $132.9 million as of December 31, 2019, an 18.2% increase from $112.5 million as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the allowance for loan losses, other real estate owned, investments, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company believes the allowance for loan losses accounting policy is critical because the loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the consolidated balance sheet, and there is significant judgment used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required loan payments. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses is based on the Company's periodic evaluation of the factors mentioned below, as well as other pertinent factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and a general component. The components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate. The allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. The specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The historical loan loss element is determined using analysis that examines loss experience.\nThe allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume. The general portion of the allowance reflects the Company's estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower's financial condition, the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates, and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors. Uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss. There are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses; some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although the Company believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from Company estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods.\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. For a loan that has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement, not the contractual terms specified by the restructuring agreement. An impaired loan is measured based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an impairment is recognized by a charge to the allowance for loan losses.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment in Debt Securities\nDebt securities with fair values that are less than amortized cost are considered impaired. Impairment may result from either a decline in the financial condition of the issuing entity or, in the case of fixed interest rate debt securities, from rising interest rates. At each consolidated financial statement date, management assesses each debt security in an unrealized loss position to determine if impaired debt securities are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other than temporary. This assessment includes consideration regarding the duration and severity of impairment, the credit quality of the issuer and a determination of whether the Company intends to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. Other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings if one of the following conditions exists: 1) the Company's intent is to sell the security; 2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the impairment is recovered; or 3) the Company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis. If, by contrast, the Company does not intend to sell the security and will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes only the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment in earnings. The credit loss component is calculated as the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of the future expected cash flows is deemed to be due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a non-recurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally corresponds with the Company's quarterly valuation process. For additional discussion, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nShare-Based Payment\nThe Company determines the fair value of stock options at grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock-based award and stock price volatility. The estimates used in the model involve inherent uncertainties and the application of Management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from that reflected in these financial statements. The fair value of non-vested restricted common shares generally equals the stock price at grant date. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those share-based awards expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be materially different. For additional discussion, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes reported in the consolidated financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach. We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets, Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, Management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business. The Company files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns.\nA \"more-likely-than-not\" recognition threshold must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, an enterprise may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. To the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions, our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities. For additional discussion, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nTransfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities are accounted for and reported based on consistent application of a financial-components approach that focuses on control. Transfers of financial assets that are sales are distinguished from transfers that are secured borrowings. Retained interests (mortgage servicing rights) in loans sold are measured by allocating the previous carrying amount of the transferred assets between the loans sold and retained interest, if any, based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on a current market interest rate. The Company recognizes a gain and a related asset for the fair value of the rights to service loans for others when loans are sold.\nThe recorded value of mortgage servicing rights is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets initially at fair value, and is amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. The Company assesses capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment based upon the fair value of those rights at each reporting date. For purposes of measuring impairment, the rights are stratified based upon the product type, term and interest rates. Fair value is determined by discounting estimated net future cash flows from mortgage servicing activities using discount rates that approximate current market rates and estimated prepayment rates, among other assumptions. The amount of impairment recognized, if any, is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights for a stratum exceeds their fair value. Impairment, if any, is recognized through a valuation allowance for each individual stratum.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. These amendments align the guidance for fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance (Issue 1). This ASU also requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, Financial Services - Depository and Lending, to present all \"principal payments received under leases\" within investing activities (Issue 2). Finally, this ASU exempts both lessees and lessors from having to provide certain interim disclosures in the fiscal year in which a company adopts the new leases standard (Issue 3). Issue 1 and Issue 2 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Issue 3 is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted Issue 3 of ASU 2019-01 on January 1, 2019, which did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The guidance clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with the leases standard. The effective date and transition requirements are the same as the effective dates and transition requirements in the credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. On October 16, 2019, the FASB voted to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13 until January 1, 2023 for small reporting companies with less than $250 million in public float as defined in the SEC's rules. The Company qualifies for this delay in adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements. In that regard, the Company has formed a cross-functional working group, under the direction of our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Credit Officer. The working group is comprised of individuals from various functional areas including credit risk, finance and information technology, among others. The Company is currently working through its implementation plan which includes assessment and documentation of processes, internal controls and data sources; model development and documentation; and system configuration, among other things. The Company is also in the process of implementing a third-party vendor solution to assist us in the application of ASU 2016-13. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 could result in an increase in the Company's allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an incurred loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an expected loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 will necessitate that the Company establish an allowance for expected credit losses for certain debt securities and other financial assets. While the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, the Company expects that the impact of adoption will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of its loan and securities portfolios as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. These amendments clarify and improve areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognition and measurement. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These amendments provide entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized Cost, with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments-Overall, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of Topic 326. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. An entity that elects the fair value option should subsequently apply the guidance in Subtopics 820-10, Fair Value Measurement-Overall, and 825-10. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates. This\nASU amends the effective dates of ASU 2017-12 (Hedging); ASU 2016-13 (Credit Losses) and ASU 2016-02 (Leases). It pushes back by one year the effective date for all other entities, and also distinguishes that smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC are considered for purposes of ASU No. 2016-13 only, as an other entity. This standard was effective immediately. ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) was effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which resulted in the Company's recognition of a right-of-use asset of $4,417,000 included in Interest receivable and other assets and lease liabilities of $4,812,000 included in Interest payable and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by the SEC and as such, the Company is allowed to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) to January 1, 2023. See discussion above on the expected impact of ASU 2016-13.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This ASU, among other narrow-scope improvements, clarifies guidance around how to report expected recoveries. This ASU permits organizations to record expected recoveries on assets purchased with credit deterioration. In addition to other narrow technical improvements, the ASU also reinforces existing guidance that prohibits organizations from recording negative allowances for available-for-sale debt securities. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether certain exceptions apply in a given period. This ASU also improves financial statement preparers' application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: a) Franchise taxes that are partially based on income; b) Transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; c) Separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and d) Enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. For public business entities, ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nSTATISTICAL INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION\nThe following statistical information and discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included in Part II (Item 6) and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II (Item 8) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity, the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amount of interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Average loan balances include non-performing loans. Interest income includes proceeds from loans on non-accrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income. Tax-exempt income is not shown on a tax equivalent basis.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity;\nInterest Rates and Interest Differential\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 43:

Commercial real estate loans generally fall into two categories, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied. Real estate construction loans are generally for financing the construction of single-family residential homes for individuals and builders we believe are well-qualified. These loans are secured by real estate and have short maturities. Residential mortgage loans, which are secured by real estate, include owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties in the Bank's market area. Loans are considered agriculture loans when the primary source of repayment is from the sale of an agricultural or agricultural-related product or service. Such loans are secured and/or unsecured to producers and processors of crops and livestock. The Bank also makes loans to individuals for investment purposes.\nAs shown in the comparative figures for loan mix during 2019 and 2018, total loans increased as a result of increases in commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans, which were partially offset by decreases in commercial loans, agriculture loans, residential construction loans and consumer loans.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nLoan maturities of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 are as follows (dollars in thousands) (excludes loans held-for-sale):\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> Maturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Variable Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWithin one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,317\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n64,807\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n73,124\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter one year through five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n94,495\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n49,836\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n144,331\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n136,931\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n426,259\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n563,190\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n239,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n540,902\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n780,645\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Accrual, Past Due, OREO and Restructured Loans\nIt is generally the Company's policy to discontinue interest accruals once a loan is past due for a period of 90 days as to interest or principal payments. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied against principal. A loan may only be restored to an accruing basis when it again becomes well secured and in the process of collection or all past due amounts have been collected and an appropriate period of performance has been demonstrated.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's non-accrual loans by loan category (dollars in thousands), net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S.

residential mortgage loan totaling $172,000 and four consumer loans totaling $253,000. Non-accrual loans amounted to $6,252,000 at December 31, 2018 and were comprised of two commercial loans totaling $750,000, two commercial real estate loans totaling $381,000, five agriculture loans totaling $4,830,000, two residential mortgage loans totaling $100,000, and one consumer loan totaling $191,000.\nIf interest on non-accrual loans had been accrued, such interest income would have approximated $139,000 and $377,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income actually recognized for these loans approximated $475,000 and $23,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in nonaccrual interest was primarily due to payoffs received on five loans during 2019 which resulted in recoveries of contractually due interest.\nLoans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Non-performing impaired loans are non-accrual loans and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing. Total non-performing impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, consisting of loans on non-accrual status totaled $1,157,000 and $6,252,000, respectively. A restructuring of a loan can constitute a troubled debt restructuring if the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. A loan that is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring is considered an impaired loan. Performing impaired loans, which consisted of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings, totaled $3,318,000 and $4,622,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company expects to collect all principal and interest due from performing impaired loans. These loans are not on non-accrual status. No assurance can be given that the existing or any additional collateral will be sufficient to secure full recovery of the obligations owed under these loans.\nThe Company had no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs the following table illustrates, total non-performing assets, which consists of loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90-days and still accruing and Other Real Estate Owned (\"OREO\") net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S. Government, including its agencies and its government-sponsored agencies, decreased $5,270,000, or 84.8%, to $942,000 from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets net of guarantees represent 0.1% and 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank's management believes that the $1,157,000 in non-accrual loans were appropriately reflected at their fair value at December 31, 2019. However, no assurance can be given that the existing or any additional collateral will be sufficient to secure full recovery of the obligations owed under these loans.\nTable 60: <table> <tr>

property that the Company has acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure proceedings, and property that the Company does not hold title to but is in actual control of, known as in-substance foreclosure. The estimated fair value of the property is determined prior to transferring the balance to OREO. The balance transferred to OREO is the estimated fair value of the property less estimated cost to sell. Impairment may be deemed necessary to bring the book value of the loan equal to the appraised value. Appraisals or loan officer evaluations are then conducted periodically thereafter charging any additional impairment to the appropriate expense account. The Company had no OREO as of the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company had one commercial real estate property classified as OREO totaling $1,092,000 as of the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPotential Problem Loans\nThe Company manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan portfolio and through review processes that include analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination of outstanding loans and delinquencies, with particular attention to portfolio dynamics and loan mix. The Company strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early enough to correct the problems, to record charge-offs promptly based on realistic assessments of collectability and current collateral values and to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at all times. Asset quality reviews of loans and other non-performing assets are administered using credit risk rating standards and criteria similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulatory agencies. The federal banking regulatory agencies utilize the following definitions for assets adversely classified for supervisory purposes: Substandard Assets: a substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\u201d Doubtful Assets: An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\u201d Other Real Estate Owned\u201d and loans rated Substandard and Doubtful are deemed classified assets.\u201d This category, which includes both performing and non-performing assets, receives an elevated level of attention regarding collection.\nCommercial loans, whether secured or unsecured, generally are made to support the short-term operations and other needs of small businesses. These loans are generally secured by the receivables, equipment, and other real property of the business and are susceptible to the related risks described above. Problem commercial loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, and payment history of the borrower. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nCommercial real estate loans generally fall into two categories, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied. Loans secured by owner occupied real estate are primarily susceptible to changes in the market conditions of the related business. This may be driven by, among other things, industry changes, geographic business changes, changes in the individual financial capacity of the business owner, general economic conditions and changes in business cycles. These same risks apply to commercial loans whether secured by equipment, receivables or other personal property or unsecured. Problem commercial real estate loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, payment history of the borrower, and site inspections. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Losses on loans secured by owner-occupied real estate, equipment, or other personal property generally are dictated by the value of underlying collateral at the time of default and liquidation of the collateral. When default is driven by issues related specifically to the business owner, collateral values tend to provide better repayment support and may result in little or no loss. Alternatively, when default is driven by more general economic conditions, underlying collateral generally has devalued more and results in larger losses due to default. Loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate are primarily susceptible to risks associated with swings in occupancy or vacancy and related shifts in lease rates, rental rates or room rates. Most often, these shifts are a result of changes in general economic or market conditions or overbuilding and resultant over-supply of space. Losses are dependent on the value of underlying collateral at the time of default. Values are generally driven by these same factors and influenced by interest rates and required rates of return as well as changes in occupancy costs. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, sales invoices, or other appropriate means. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nAgricultural loans, whether secured or unsecured, generally are made to producers and processors of crops and livestock. Repayment is primarily from the sale of an agricultural product or service. Agricultural loans are generally secured by inventory, receivables, equipment, and other real property. Agricultural loans primarily are susceptible to changes in market demand for specific commodities. This may be exacerbated by, among other things, industry changes, changes in the individual financial capacity of the business owner, general economic conditions and changes in business cycles, as well as changing weather conditions. Problem agricultural loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, crop budgets, payment history, and crop inspections. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nResidential mortgage loans, which are secured by real estate, are primarily susceptible to three risks; non-payment due to diminished or lost income, over-extension of credit, a lack of borrower's cash flow to sustain payments, and shortfalls in collateral value. In general, non-payment is due to loss of employment and follows general economic trends in the marketplace, particularly the upward movement in the unemployment rate, loss of collateral value, and demand shifts. Problem residential mortgage loans are generally identified via payment default. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nConstruction loans, whether owner occupied or non-owner occupied residential development loans, are not only susceptible to the related risks described above but the added risks of construction itself, including cost over-runs, mismanagement of the project, or lack of demand and market changes experienced at time of completion. Again, losses are primarily related to underlying collateral value and changes therein as described above. Problem construction loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns and payment history of the borrower. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors, or repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nConsumer loans, whether unsecured or secured, are primarily susceptible to four risks: non-payment due to diminished or lost income, over-extension of credit, a lack of borrower's cash flow to sustain payments, and shortfall in collateral value. In general, non-payment is due to loss of employment and will follow general economic trends in the marketplace, particularly the upward movements in the unemployment rate, loss of collateral value, and demand shifts. Problem consumer loans are generally identified via payment default. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nOnce a loan becomes delinquent or repayment becomes questionable, a Company collection officer will address collateral shortfalls with the borrower and attempt to obtain additional collateral or a principal payment. If this is not forthcoming and payment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement becomes unlikely, the Company will consider the loan to be impaired and will estimate its probable loss, using the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For collateral dependent loans, the Company will utilize a recent valuation of the underlying collateral less estimated costs of sale, and charge-off the loan down to the estimated net realizable amount. Depending on the length of time until final collection, the Company may periodically revalue the estimated loss and take additional charge-offs or specific reserves as warranted. Revaluations may occur as often as every 3-12 months depending on the underlying collateral and volatility of values. Final charge-offs or recoveries are taken when the collateral is liquidated and the actual loss is confirmed. Unpaid balances on loans after or during collection and liquidation may also be pursued through legal action and attachment of wages or judgment liens on the borrower's other assets.\nExcluding the non-performing loans cited previously, loans totaling $8,749,000 and $15,926,000 were classified as substandard or doubtful loans, representing potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Management's opinion, the potential loss related to these problem loans was sufficiently covered by the Bank's existing loan loss reserve (Allowance for Loan Losses) at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 1.58% and 1.65%, respectively.\nSUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE\nThe Company's allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, non-performing loans and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. A portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to classified loans whose full collectability is uncertain. Such allocations are determined by Management based on loan-by-loan analyses. In addition, loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends, grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent. Last, allocations are made to non-criticized and classified commercial loans and residential real estate loans based on historical loss rates, and other statistical data. The remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated. The unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance. It addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with Management's analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio, which are related to the risks of the Company's general lending activity. Included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have yet been recognized in past loan charge-off history (external factors). The external factors evaluated by the Company include: economic and business conditions, external competitive issues, and other factors. Also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the Company's loan portfolio and credit administration (internal factors). The internal factors evaluated by the Company include: loan review system, adequacy of lending Management and staff, loan policies and procedures, problem loan trends, concentrations of credit, and other factors. By their nature, these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify. Management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on Management's judgment as to the level of risk and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance. Management considered the $12,356,000 allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of December 31, 2019.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n(Dollars in

At December 31, 2019, the Company had collateral borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $349,068,000 and at such date, also had unsecured Federal Funds lines of credit totaling $82,000,000 with correspondent banks.\nLong-Term Borrowings\nThe Company had no long-term borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Average outstanding balances of long-term borrowings were $0 during 2019 and 2018.\nSupplemental Compensation Plans\nThe Company and the Bank maintain an unfunded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan ( Salary Continuation Plan\u201d) and related split dollar plan for a select group of highly compensated employees. Eligibility to participate in the Salary Continuation Plan is limited to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Bank that are designated by the Board. Additionally, the Company and the Bank adopted a supplemental executive retirement plan ( SERP\u201d) in 2006. The SERP is intended to integrate the various forms of retirement payments offered to executives. There are currently three participants in the SERP. At December 31, 2019, the accrued benefit liability was $5,871,000, of which $3,891,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and $1,980,000 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2018, the accrued benefit liability was $5,322,000, of which $3,640,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and $1,682,000 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company and the Bank maintain an unfunded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan ( Directors' Retirement Plan\u201d) and related split dollar plan for the directors of the Bank. At December 31, 2019, the accrued benefit liability was $820,000, of which $798,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and $22,000 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2018, the accrued benefit liability was $787,000, of which $827,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and ($40,000) was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $14.7 million, representing an increase of $2.2 million, or 17.3%, compared to net income of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was principally attributable to a $3.4 million increase in interest income and $2.1 million decrease in provision for loan loss, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in interest expense, $1.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $0.9 million increase in provision for income taxes.\nTotal assets increased by $42.7 million, or 3.4%, to $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets was mainly due to a $28.3 million increase in investment securities, $7.3 million increase in net loans (including loans held-for-sale), a $7.1 million increase in certificates of deposit and a $5.2 million increase in interest receivable and other assets, which was partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million decrease in other real estate owned. Total deposits increased $14.0 million, or 1.3%, to $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the excess of interest and fees earned on the Bank's loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and banker's acceptances over the interest expense paid on deposits, mortgage notes and other borrowed funds which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is primarily affected by the yields on the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding during the period. The $2,785,000 increase in the Bank's net interest income in 2019 from 2018 was driven by both increased volumes and interest rates. Average investment securities growth was the primary driver from a volume perspective, contributing $519,000 in additional interest income compared to 2018. This was partially offset by a decrease of $321,000 in interest income due to a decrease in average due from bank balances. Increasing interest rates drove increases in interest income from loans and investments by $1,795,000 and $775,000, respectively, while the rates paid on interest bearing deposit accounts increased interest expense by $629,000. See Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense\u201d set forth on page 34 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the effects of interest rates and loan/deposit volume on net interest income.\nThe Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit, was 4.50% at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the prime rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September, and December) to end the year at 5.50%. During 2019, the prime rate decreased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of August, September, and October) to end the year at 4.75%. The effective federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, was 1.50% at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the effective federal funds rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the period at 2.50%. During 2019, the effective federal funds rate decreased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of July, September and October) to end the period at 1.75%.\nWe are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011. Nonetheless, we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result. However, as market interest rates have increased, we have increased the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products.\nThe nature and impact of future changes in interest rates and monetary policy on the business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.

The increase in interest income on loans was the result of a 24 basis point increase in loan yields and 0.3% increase in average loan volume.\nInterest income on investment securities for 2019 was up 22.9% from 2018, increasing from $5,643,000 to $6,937,000. The increase in interest income on investment securities was the result of an 8.9% increase in average investment securities volume and a 25 basis point increase in investment securities yields. The Bank's strategy in 2019 was to use its excess cash to purchase investment securities and increase the investment portfolio. Investment securities yields were 2.17% and 1.92% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest income on interest-bearing due from banks for 2019 was down 0.7% from 2018, decreasing from $2,163,000 to $2,148,000. The decrease in interest income on interest-bearing due from banks was the result of a 13.8% decrease in average balances of interest-bearing due from banks, which was partially offset by a 29 basis point increase in yield on interest-bearing due from banks.\nInterest income on certificates of deposit for 2019 was up 241.4% from 2018, increasing from $104,000 to $355,000. The increase in interest income on certificates of deposit was the result of a 201.4% increase in average balances of certificates of deposit and a 33 basis point increase in yield on certificates of deposit.\nInterest expense on deposits for 2019 was up 46.6% from 2018, increasing from $1,268,000 to $1,859,000. The increase in interest expense on deposits was the result of an 8 basis point increase in interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, which was partially offset by a 1.0% decrease in average balances of interest-bearing deposits.\nThe mix of deposits for the previous three years was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-interest-Bearing Demand\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,551\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n36.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n394,106\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n35.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n361,729\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n33.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-Bearing Demand (NOW)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n308,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n27.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n307,727\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n27.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n293,464\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n27.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings and MMDAs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n334,672\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n30.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n333,788\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n30.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n335,709\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n31.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n58,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n67,177\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n77,705\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,110,268\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,102,798\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,068,607\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan yields increased in 2019 and 2018 and deposit expense increased in 2019 and 2018. The Bank's net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets) was 4.00% in 2019 and 3.83% in 2018. The net spread between the rate for total earning assets and the rate for interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds increased 14 basis points from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the net spread was primarily due to an overall increase in interest rates on earning assets, which was partially offset by an increase in interest rates on interest-bearing deposits.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is established by charges to earnings based on management's overall evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. Based on this evaluation, the provision for loan losses decreased to $0 in 2019 from $2,100,000 in 2018, primarily due to limited loan growth coupled with improvements in credit quality and decreased non-performing assets and associated specific reserves in 2019. The amount of loans charged-off increased in 2019 to $779,000 from $685,000 in 2018, and recoveries increased to $313,000 in 2019 from $274,000 in 2018. The increase in charge-offs was due to an increase in charge-offs on commercial, agriculture and consumer loans, which was partially offset by a decrease in charge-offs on commercial real estate loans. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total loans at December 31, 2019 was 1.58% compared to 1.65% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more, net of guarantees was 1,311.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 250.4% at December 31, 2018.\nNon-Interest Income and Expenses\nNon-interest income consisted primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, net realized gains on loans held-for-sale, and other income. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $15,000 in 2019 over 2018. Net realized gains on loans held-for-sale increased $277,000 in 2019 over 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of loan sales. Other income decreased $291,000 in 2019 over 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income, which was partially offset by an increase in mortgage brokerage income.\nNon-interest expenses consisted primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, stationery and supplies expense, advertising and other expenses. Non-interest expenses increased to $33,940,000 in 2019 from $32,163,000 in 2018, representing an increase of $1,777,000, or 5.5%.\nFollowing is an analysis of the increase or decrease in the components of non-interest expenses (dollars in thousands) during the periods specified:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 over 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and Employee Benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,151\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOccupancy and Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nData Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n28.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStationery and Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(94\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(24.2\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdvertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n16.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirectors Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(9\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3.0\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOREO Expense and Impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,221.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(616\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(11.6\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,777\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2019 was primarily due to a 7% increase in regular salaries, a 29% increase in commissions and a 16% increase in group insurance. The increase in regular salaries expense and group insurance was primarily due to current year salary increases and an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees, which was partially due to staffing hired for a new branch which opened in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in commissions was primarily due to an increase in mortgage originations. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to rent expense and other expenses associated with the opening of an administrative office space in the third quarter of 2019 and a new branch in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in data processing expense was primarily due to costs associated with enhanced IT infrastructure as a result of a decision to outsource core processing and network infrastructure to third parties. The increase in other real estate owned expense was primarily due to a writedown on an existing commercial real estate property that was sold prior to year-end 2019. The decrease in other expenses was primarily due to a reversal of FDIC assessments expense due to the receipt of credits applied in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and a decrease in amortization of low-income housing tax credit investments in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is primarily affected by the tax rate, the level of earnings before taxes and the level of tax-exempt income. In 2019, tax expense increased to $5,670,000 from $4,744,000 in 2018, due to an increase in income before taxes. Non-taxable municipal bond income was $300,000 and $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to generate cash at a reasonable cost to fulfill lending commitments and support asset growth, while satisfying the withdrawal demands of deposit customers and any debt repayment requirements. The Bank's principal sources of liquidity are core deposits and loan and investment payments and prepayments. Providing a secondary source of liquidity is the available-for-sale investment portfolio. The Company held $342,897,000 in total investment securities at December 31, 2019. Under certain deposit, borrowing, and other arrangements, the Company must hold and pledge investment securities as collateral. At December 31, 2019, such collateral requirements totaled approximately $37,943,000. As a smaller source of liquidity, the Bank can utilize existing credit arrangements.\nThe Company's primary source of liquidity on a stand-alone basis is dividends from the Bank. As discussed in Part I (Item 1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, dividends from the Bank are subject to regulatory and corporate law restrictions.\nLiquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Bank experiences seasonal swings in deposits, which impact liquidity. Management has sought to address these seasonal swings by scheduling investment maturities and developing seasonal credit arrangements with the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Funds lines of credit with correspondent banks. In addition, the ability of the Bank's real estate department to originate and sell loans into the secondary market has provided another tool for the management of liquidity. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not created any special purpose entities to securitize assets or to obtain off-balance sheet funding.\nThe liquidity position of the Bank is managed daily, thus enabling the Bank to adapt its position according to market fluctuations. Liquidity is measured by various ratios, the most common of which is the ratio of net loans (including loans held-for-sale) to deposits. This ratio was 67.9% on December 31, 2019 and 68.1% on December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank's ratio of core deposits to total assets was 86.9% and 88.7%, respectively. Core deposits include demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction deposits, savings and money market deposit accounts, and time deposits $250,000 or less. Core deposits are important in maintaining a strong liquidity position as they represent a stable and relatively low-cost source of funds. Management believes that the Bank's liquidity position was adequate in 2019. This is best illustrated by the change in the Bank's net non-core ratio, which explains the degree of reliance on non-core liabilities to fund long-term assets. At December 31, 2019, the Bank's net core funding dependence ratio, the difference between non-core funds, time deposits $250,000 or more and brokered time deposits under $250,000, and short-term investments to long-term assets, was (7.96%) as of December 31, 2019 and (12.14%) as of December 31, 2018. This ratio indicated at December 31, 2019, the Bank did not significantly rely upon non-core deposits and borrowings to fund the Bank's long-term assets, namely loans and investments. The Bank believes that by maintaining adequate volumes of short-term investments and implementing competitive pricing strategies on deposits, it can ensure adequate liquidity to support future growth. The Bank also believes that its liquidity position remains strong to meet both present and future financial obligations and commitments, events or uncertainties that have resulted or are reasonably likely to result in material changes with respect to the Bank's liquidity.\nCommitments\nThe following table details the amounts and expected maturities of commitments as of December 31, 2019 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Maturities by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n86,497\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n63,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,630\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,519\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13,667\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,544\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8,961\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAgriculture\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23,921\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14,494\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n4,857\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n4,449\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n22,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n20,104\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,133\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n50,925\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13,503\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5,551\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,946\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23,925\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommitments to sell loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStandby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,455\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,256\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n202,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,641\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,750\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,141\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. These loans have been sold to third parties without recourse, subject to customary default, representations and warranties, recourse for breaches of the terms of the sales contracts and payment default recourse.\nFinancial instruments, whose contract amounts represent credit risk at December 31 of the indicated years, were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUndisbursed loan commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n198,534\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n201,983\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStandby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,455\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,974\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommitments to sell loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n202,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n205,527\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank expects its liquidity position to remain strong in 2020 as the Bank expects to continue to grow into existing markets. The stock market remained volatile this past year, but with the overall trend being favorable. While the Bank did not experience an outflow of deposits in 2019, the potential of outflows still exists if the stock market values continue to improve. Regardless of the outcome, the Bank believes that it has the means to provide adequate liquidity for funding normal operations in 2020.\nCapital\nThe Company believes a strong capital position is essential to the Company's continued growth and profitability. A solid capital base provides depositors and shareholders with a margin of safety, while allowing the Company to take advantage of profitable opportunities, support future growth and provide protection against any unforeseen losses.\nAt December 31, 2019, stockholders' equity totaled $132.9 million, an increase of $20.5 million from $112.5 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to net income of $14.7 million. Also affecting capital in 2019 was paid in capital in the amount of $0.6 million resulting from employee stock purchases and stock plan accruals. See the section entitled Business - Capital Standards\u201d for additional information.\nThe capital of the Company and the Bank historically have been maintained at a level that is in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized\u201d institution. The policy of annual stock dividends has, over time, allowed the Company to match capital and asset growth through retained earnings and a managed program of geographic growth.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nIntroduction\nThis overview highlights selected information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of changes in results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the Company and its subsidiary, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2019.\nOur subsidiary, First Northern Bank of Dixon, is a California state-chartered bank that derives most of its revenues from lending and deposit taking in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California. Interest rates, business conditions and customer confidence all affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition, the regulatory environment and competition can challenge our ability to generate those revenues.\nFinancial highlights for 2019 include:\nThe Company reported net income of $14.7 million for 2019, a 17.3% increase compared to net income of $12.6 million for 2018. Net income per common share for 2019 was $1.15, an increase of 16.2% compared to net income per common share of $0.99 for 2018. Net income per common share on a fully diluted basis was $1.14 for 2019, an increase of 17.5% compared to net income per common share on a fully diluted basis of $0.97 for 2018.\nNet interest income totaled $47.1 million for 2019, an increase of 6.3% from $44.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased average loan volumes and rates, increased investment securities volumes and rates, increased rates on interest bearing due from banks, increased average certificates of deposit volumes and rates, which was partially offset by decreased average due from banks volume and increased average interest-bearing transaction, savings and money market account volumes and rates.\nThere was no provision for loan losses in 2019 compared to provision for loan loss of $2.1 million in 2018. Net charge-offs were $466 thousand in 2019 compared to $411 thousand in 2018. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to limited loan growth coupled with improvements in credit quality and decreased non-performing assets and associated specific reserves.\nNon-interest income totaled $7.2 million for each of the periods ended in 2019 and 2018. Gain on sale of loans held-for sale and mortgage brokerage income increased in 2019 compared to 2018, which was partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $33.9 million for 2019, up 5.5% from $32.2 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits due to increased staffing levels, occupancy and equipment expense due to the opening of an administrative office space and a branch in the second half of 2019, data processing expenses as a result of enhanced IT infrastructure and outsourcing of core processing and other real estate owned expense primarily due to a write-down on other real estate owned. The increase in non-interest expenses was partially offset by a reversal of FDIC assessments expense due to the receipt of credits applied in the second half of 2019.\nThe Company reported total assets of $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 3.4% from $1.25 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nInvestments increased to $342.9 million as of December 31, 2019, a 9.0% increase from $314.6 million as of December 31, 2018. U.S. Treasury securities totaled $43.3 million as of December 31, 2019, down 14.7% from $50.7 million as of December 31, 2018; securities of U.S. government agencies and corporations totaled $53.9 million, up 28.1% from $42.1 million as of December 31, 2018; obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled $27.0 million, up 41.0% from $19.2 million as of December 31, 2018; collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $79.4 million, up 24.5% from $63.8 million as of December 31, 2018; and mortgage-backed securities totaled $139.3 million, up 0.3% from $138.9 million as of December 31, 2018.\nLoans (including loans held-for-sale), net of allowance, increased to $773.0 million as of December 31, 2019, a 1.0% increase from $765.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Commercial loans totaled $106.1 million as of December 31, 2019, down 15.2% from $125.2 million as of December 31, 2018; commercial real estate loans were $451.8 million, up 7.5% from $420.1 million as of December 31, 2018; agriculture loans were $115.8 million, down 6.4% from $123.6 million as of December 31, 2018; residential mortgage loans were $64.9 million, up 27.2% from $51.1 million as of December 31, 2018; residential construction loans were $15.2 million, down 24.4% from $20.1 million as of December 31, 2018; and consumer loans totaled $26.8 million, down 24.2% from $35.4 million as of December 31, 2018.\nDeposits increased to $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2019, a 1.3% increase from $1.12 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nStockholders' equity increased to $132.9 million as of December 31, 2019, an 18.2% increase from $112.5 million as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the allowance for loan losses, other real estate owned, investments, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company believes the allowance for loan losses accounting policy is critical because the loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the consolidated balance sheet, and there is significant judgment used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required loan payments. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses is based on the Company's periodic evaluation of the factors mentioned below, as well as other pertinent factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and a general component. The components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate. The allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. The specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The historical loan loss element is determined using analysis that examines loss experience.\nThe allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume. The general portion of the allowance reflects the Company's estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower's financial condition, the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates, and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors. Uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss. There are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses; some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although the Company believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from Company estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods.\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. For a loan that has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement, not the contractual terms specified by the restructuring agreement. An impaired loan is measured based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an impairment is recognized by a charge to the allowance for loan losses.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment in Debt Securities\nDebt securities with fair values that are less than amortized cost are considered impaired. Impairment may result from either a decline in the financial condition of the issuing entity or, in the case of fixed interest rate debt securities, from rising interest rates. At each consolidated financial statement date, management assesses each debt security in an unrealized loss position to determine if impaired debt securities are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other than temporary. This assessment includes consideration regarding the duration and severity of impairment, the credit quality of the issuer and a determination of whether the Company intends to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. Other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings if one of the following conditions exists: 1) the Company's intent is to sell the security; 2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the impairment is recovered; or 3) the Company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis. If, by contrast, the Company does not intend to sell the security and will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes only the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment in earnings. The credit loss component is calculated as the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of the future expected cash flows is deemed to be due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a non-recurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally corresponds with the Company's quarterly valuation process. For additional discussion, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nShare-Based Payment\nThe Company determines the fair value of stock options at grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock-based award and stock price volatility. The estimates used in the model involve inherent uncertainties and the application of Management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from that reflected in these financial statements. The fair value of non-vested restricted common shares generally equals the stock price at grant date. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those share-based awards expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be materially different. For additional discussion, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes reported in the consolidated financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach. We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets, Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, Management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business. The Company files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns.\nA \"more-likely-than-not\" recognition threshold must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, an enterprise may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. To the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions, our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities. For additional discussion, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nTransfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities are accounted for and reported based on consistent application of a financial-components approach that focuses on control. Transfers of financial assets that are sales are distinguished from transfers that are secured borrowings. Retained interests (mortgage servicing rights) in loans sold are measured by allocating the previous carrying amount of the transferred assets between the loans sold and retained interest, if any, based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on a current market interest rate. The Company recognizes a gain and a related asset for the fair value of the rights to service loans for others when loans are sold.\nThe recorded value of mortgage servicing rights is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets initially at fair value, and is amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. The Company assesses capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment based upon the fair value of those rights at each reporting date. For purposes of measuring impairment, the rights are stratified based upon the product type, term and interest rates. Fair value is determined by discounting estimated net future cash flows from mortgage servicing activities using discount rates that approximate current market rates and estimated prepayment rates, among other assumptions. The amount of impairment recognized, if any, is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights for a stratum exceeds their fair value. Impairment, if any, is recognized through a valuation allowance for each individual stratum.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. These amendments align the guidance for fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance (Issue 1). This ASU also requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, Financial Services - Depository and Lending, to present all \"principal payments received under leases\" within investing activities (Issue 2). Finally, this ASU exempts both lessees and lessors from having to provide certain interim disclosures in the fiscal year in which a company adopts the new leases standard (Issue 3). Issue 1 and Issue 2 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Issue 3 is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted Issue 3 of ASU 2019-01 on January 1, 2019, which did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The guidance clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with the leases standard. The effective date and transition requirements are the same as the effective dates and transition requirements in the credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. On October 16, 2019, the FASB voted to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13 until January 1, 2023 for small reporting companies with less than $250 million in public float as defined in the SEC's rules. The Company qualifies for this delay in adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements. In that regard, the Company has formed a cross-functional working group, under the direction of our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Credit Officer. The working group is comprised of individuals from various functional areas including credit risk, finance and information technology, among others. The Company is currently working through its implementation plan which includes assessment and documentation of processes, internal controls and data sources; model development and documentation; and system configuration, among other things. The Company is also in the process of implementing a third-party vendor solution to assist us in the application of ASU 2016-13. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 could result in an increase in the Company's allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an incurred loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an expected loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 will necessitate that the Company establish an allowance for expected credit losses for certain debt securities and other financial assets. While the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, the Company expects that the impact of adoption will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of its loan and securities portfolios as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. These amendments clarify and improve areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognition and measurement. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These amendments provide entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized Cost, with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments-Overall, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of Topic 326. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. An entity that elects the fair value option should subsequently apply the guidance in Subtopics 820-10, Fair Value Measurement-Overall, and 825-10. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates. This\nASU amends the effective dates of ASU 2017-12 (Hedging); ASU 2016-13 (Credit Losses) and ASU 2016-02 (Leases). It pushes back by one year the effective date for all other entities, and also distinguishes that smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC are considered for purposes of ASU No. 2016-13 only, as an other entity. This standard was effective immediately. ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) was effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which resulted in the Company's recognition of a right-of-use asset of $4,417,000 included in Interest receivable and other assets and lease liabilities of $4,812,000 included in Interest payable and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by the SEC and as such, the Company is allowed to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) to January 1, 2023. See discussion above on the expected impact of ASU 2016-13.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This ASU, among other narrow-scope improvements, clarifies guidance around how to report expected recoveries. This ASU permits organizations to record expected recoveries on assets purchased with credit deterioration. In addition to other narrow technical improvements, the ASU also reinforces existing guidance that prohibits organizations from recording negative allowances for available-for-sale debt securities. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether certain exceptions apply in a given period. This ASU also improves financial statement preparers' application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: a) Franchise taxes that are partially based on income; b) Transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; c) Separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and d) Enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. For public business entities, ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nSTATISTICAL INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION\nThe following statistical information and discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included in Part II (Item 6) and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II (Item 8) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity, the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amount of interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Average loan balances include non-performing loans. Interest income includes proceeds from loans on non-accrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income. Tax-exempt income is not shown on a tax equivalent basis.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity;\nInterest Rates and Interest Differential\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 43:

Commercial real estate loans generally fall into two categories, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied. Real estate construction loans are generally for financing the construction of single-family residential homes for individuals and builders we believe are well-qualified. These loans are secured by real estate and have short maturities. Residential mortgage loans, which are secured by real estate, include owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties in the Bank's market area. Loans are considered agriculture loans when the primary source of repayment is from the sale of an agricultural or agricultural-related product or service. Such loans are secured and/or unsecured to producers and processors of crops and livestock. The Bank also makes loans to individuals for investment purposes.\nAs shown in the comparative figures for loan mix during 2019 and 2018, total loans increased as a result of increases in commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans, which were partially offset by decreases in commercial loans, agriculture loans, residential construction loans and consumer loans.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nLoan maturities of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 are as follows (dollars in thousands) (excludes loans held-for-sale):\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> Maturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Variable Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWithin one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,317\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n64,807\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n73,124\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter one year through five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n94,495\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n49,836\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n144,331\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n136,931\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n426,259\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n563,190\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n239,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n540,902\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n780,645\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Accrual, Past Due, OREO and Restructured Loans\nIt is generally the Company's policy to discontinue interest accruals once a loan is past due for a period of 90 days as to interest or principal payments. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied against principal. A loan may only be restored to an accruing basis when it again becomes well secured and in the process of collection or all past due amounts have been collected and an appropriate period of performance has been demonstrated.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's non-accrual loans by loan category (dollars in thousands), net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S.

residential mortgage loan totaling $172,000 and four consumer loans totaling $253,000. Non-accrual loans amounted to $6,252,000 at December 31, 2018 and were comprised of two commercial loans totaling $750,000, two commercial real estate loans totaling $381,000, five agriculture loans totaling $4,830,000, two residential mortgage loans totaling $100,000, and one consumer loan totaling $191,000.\nIf interest on non-accrual loans had been accrued, such interest income would have approximated $139,000 and $377,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income actually recognized for these loans approximated $475,000 and $23,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in nonaccrual interest was primarily due to payoffs received on five loans during 2019 which resulted in recoveries of contractually due interest.\nLoans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Non-performing impaired loans are non-accrual loans and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing. Total non-performing impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, consisting of loans on non-accrual status totaled $1,157,000 and $6,252,000, respectively. A restructuring of a loan can constitute a troubled debt restructuring if the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. A loan that is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring is considered an impaired loan. Performing impaired loans, which consisted of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings, totaled $3,318,000 and $4,622,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company expects to collect all principal and interest due from performing impaired loans. These loans are not on non-accrual status. No assurance can be given that the existing or any additional collateral will be sufficient to secure full recovery of the obligations owed under these loans.\nThe Company had no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs the following table illustrates, total non-performing assets, which consists of loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90-days and still accruing and Other Real Estate Owned (\"OREO\") net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S. Government, including its agencies and its government-sponsored agencies, decreased $5,270,000, or 84.8%, to $942,000 from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets net of guarantees represent 0.1% and 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank's management believes that the $1,157,000 in non-accrual loans were appropriately reflected at their fair value at December 31, 2019. However, no assurance can be given that the existing or any additional collateral will be sufficient to secure full recovery of the obligations owed under these loans.\nTable 60: <table> <tr>

property that the Company has acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure proceedings, and property that the Company does not hold title to but is in actual control of, known as in-substance foreclosure. The estimated fair value of the property is determined prior to transferring the balance to OREO. The balance transferred to OREO is the estimated fair value of the property less estimated cost to sell. Impairment may be deemed necessary to bring the book value of the loan equal to the appraised value. Appraisals or loan officer evaluations are then conducted periodically thereafter charging any additional impairment to the appropriate expense account. The Company had no OREO as of the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company had one commercial real estate property classified as OREO totaling $1,092,000 as of the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPotential Problem Loans\nThe Company manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan portfolio and through review processes that include analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination of outstanding loans and delinquencies, with particular attention to portfolio dynamics and loan mix. The Company strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early enough to correct the problems, to record charge-offs promptly based on realistic assessments of collectability and current collateral values and to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at all times. Asset quality reviews of loans and other non-performing assets are administered using credit risk rating standards and criteria similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulatory agencies. The federal banking regulatory agencies utilize the following definitions for assets adversely classified for supervisory purposes: Substandard Assets: a substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\u201d Doubtful Assets: An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\u201d Other Real Estate Owned\u201d and loans rated Substandard and Doubtful are deemed classified assets.\u201d This category, which includes both performing and non-performing assets, receives an elevated level of attention regarding collection.\nCommercial loans, whether secured or unsecured, generally are made to support the short-term operations and other needs of small businesses. These loans are generally secured by the receivables, equipment, and other real property of the business and are susceptible to the related risks described above. Problem commercial loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, and payment history of the borrower. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nCommercial real estate loans generally fall into two categories, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied. Loans secured by owner occupied real estate are primarily susceptible to changes in the market conditions of the related business. This may be driven by, among other things, industry changes, geographic business changes, changes in the individual financial capacity of the business owner, general economic conditions and changes in business cycles. These same risks apply to commercial loans whether secured by equipment, receivables or other personal property or unsecured. Problem commercial real estate loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, payment history of the borrower, and site inspections. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Losses on loans secured by owner-occupied real estate, equipment, or other personal property generally are dictated by the value of underlying collateral at the time of default and liquidation of the collateral. When default is driven by issues related specifically to the business owner, collateral values tend to provide better repayment support and may result in little or no loss. Alternatively, when default is driven by more general economic conditions, underlying collateral generally has devalued more and results in larger losses due to default. Loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate are primarily susceptible to risks associated with swings in occupancy or vacancy and related shifts in lease rates, rental rates or room rates. Most often, these shifts are a result of changes in general economic or market conditions or overbuilding and resultant over-supply of space. Losses are dependent on the value of underlying collateral at the time of default. Values are generally driven by these same factors and influenced by interest rates and required rates of return as well as changes in occupancy costs. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, sales invoices, or other appropriate means. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nAgricultural loans, whether secured or unsecured, generally are made to producers and processors of crops and livestock. Repayment is primarily from the sale of an agricultural product or service. Agricultural loans are generally secured by inventory, receivables, equipment, and other real property. Agricultural loans primarily are susceptible to changes in market demand for specific commodities. This may be exacerbated by, among other things, industry changes, changes in the individual financial capacity of the business owner, general economic conditions and changes in business cycles, as well as changing weather conditions. Problem agricultural loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, crop budgets, payment history, and crop inspections. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nResidential mortgage loans, which are secured by real estate, are primarily susceptible to three risks; non-payment due to diminished or lost income, over-extension of credit, a lack of borrower's cash flow to sustain payments, and shortfalls in collateral value. In general, non-payment is due to loss of employment and follows general economic trends in the marketplace, particularly the upward movement in the unemployment rate, loss of collateral value, and demand shifts. Problem residential mortgage loans are generally identified via payment default. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nConstruction loans, whether owner occupied or non-owner occupied residential development loans, are not only susceptible to the related risks described above but the added risks of construction itself, including cost over-runs, mismanagement of the project, or lack of demand and market changes experienced at time of completion. Again, losses are primarily related to underlying collateral value and changes therein as described above. Problem construction loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns and payment history of the borrower. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors, or repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nConsumer loans, whether unsecured or secured, are primarily susceptible to four risks: non-payment due to diminished or lost income, over-extension of credit, a lack of borrower's cash flow to sustain payments, and shortfall in collateral value. In general, non-payment is due to loss of employment and will follow general economic trends in the marketplace, particularly the upward movements in the unemployment rate, loss of collateral value, and demand shifts. Problem consumer loans are generally identified via payment default. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nOnce a loan becomes delinquent or repayment becomes questionable, a Company collection officer will address collateral shortfalls with the borrower and attempt to obtain additional collateral or a principal payment. If this is not forthcoming and payment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement becomes unlikely, the Company will consider the loan to be impaired and will estimate its probable loss, using the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For collateral dependent loans, the Company will utilize a recent valuation of the underlying collateral less estimated costs of sale, and charge-off the loan down to the estimated net realizable amount. Depending on the length of time until final collection, the Company may periodically revalue the estimated loss and take additional charge-offs or specific reserves as warranted. Revaluations may occur as often as every 3-12 months depending on the underlying collateral and volatility of values. Final charge-offs or recoveries are taken when the collateral is liquidated and the actual loss is confirmed. Unpaid balances on loans after or during collection and liquidation may also be pursued through legal action and attachment of wages or judgment liens on the borrower's other assets.\nExcluding the non-performing loans cited previously, loans totaling $8,749,000 and $15,926,000 were classified as substandard or doubtful loans, representing potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Management's opinion, the potential loss related to these problem loans was sufficiently covered by the Bank's existing loan loss reserve (Allowance for Loan Losses) at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 1.58% and 1.65%, respectively.\nSUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE\nThe Company's allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, non-performing loans and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. A portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to classified loans whose full collectability is uncertain. Such allocations are determined by Management based on loan-by-loan analyses. In addition, loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends, grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent. Last, allocations are made to non-criticized and classified commercial loans and residential real estate loans based on historical loss rates, and other statistical data. The remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated. The unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance. It addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with Management's analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio, which are related to the risks of the Company's general lending activity. Included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have yet been recognized in past loan charge-off history (external factors). The external factors evaluated by the Company include: economic and business conditions, external competitive issues, and other factors. Also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the Company's loan portfolio and credit administration (internal factors). The internal factors evaluated by the Company include: loan review system, adequacy of lending Management and staff, loan policies and procedures, problem loan trends, concentrations of credit, and other factors. By their nature, these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify. Management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on Management's judgment as to the level of risk and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance. Management considered the $12,356,000 allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of December 31, 2019.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n(Dollars in

At December 31, 2018, the accrued benefit liability was $787,000, of which $827,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and ($40,000) was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $14.7 million, representing an increase of $2.2 million, or 17.3%, compared to net income of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was principally attributable to a $3.4 million increase in interest income and $2.1 million decrease in provision for loan loss, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in interest expense, $1.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $0.9 million increase in provision for income taxes.\nTotal assets increased by $42.7 million, or 3.4%, to $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets was mainly due to a $28.3 million increase in investment securities, $7.3 million increase in net loans (including loans held-for-sale), a $7.1 million increase in certificates of deposit and a $5.2 million increase in interest receivable and other assets, which was partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million decrease in other real estate owned. Total deposits increased $14.0 million, or 1.3%, to $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the excess of interest and fees earned on the Bank's loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and banker's acceptances over the interest expense paid on deposits, mortgage notes and other borrowed funds which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is primarily affected by the yields on the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding during the period. The $2,785,000 increase in the Bank's net interest income in 2019 from 2018 was driven by both increased volumes and interest rates. Average investment securities growth was the primary driver from a volume perspective, contributing $519,000 in additional interest income compared to 2018. This was partially offset by a decrease of $321,000 in interest income due to a decrease in average due from bank balances. Increasing interest rates drove increases in interest income from loans and investments by $1,795,000 and $775,000, respectively, while the rates paid on interest bearing deposit accounts increased interest expense by $629,000. See Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense\u201d set forth on page 34 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the effects of interest rates and loan/deposit volume on net interest income.\nThe Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit, was 4.50% at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the prime rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September, and December) to end the year at 5.50%. During 2019, the prime rate decreased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of August, September, and October) to end the year at 4.75%. The effective federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, was 1.50% at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the effective federal funds rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the period at 2.50%. During 2019, the effective federal funds rate decreased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of July, September and October) to end the period at 1.75%.\nWe are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011. Nonetheless, we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result. However, as market interest rates have increased, we have increased the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products.\nThe nature and impact of future changes in interest rates and monetary policy on the business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.

The increase in interest income on loans was the result of a 24 basis point increase in loan yields and 0.3% increase in average loan volume.\nInterest income on investment securities for 2019 was up 22.9% from 2018, increasing from $5,643,000 to $6,937,000. The increase in interest income on investment securities was the result of an 8.9% increase in average investment securities volume and a 25 basis point increase in investment securities yields. The Bank's strategy in 2019 was to use its excess cash to purchase investment securities and increase the investment portfolio. Investment securities yields were 2.17% and 1.92% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest income on interest-bearing due from banks for 2019 was down 0.7% from 2018, decreasing from $2,163,000 to $2,148,000. The decrease in interest income on interest-bearing due from banks was the result of a 13.8% decrease in average balances of interest-bearing due from banks, which was partially offset by a 29 basis point increase in yield on interest-bearing due from banks.\nInterest income on certificates of deposit for 2019 was up 241.4% from 2018, increasing from $104,000 to $355,000. The increase in interest income on certificates of deposit was the result of a 201.4% increase in average balances of certificates of deposit and a 33 basis point increase in yield on certificates of deposit.\nInterest expense on deposits for 2019 was up 46.6% from 2018, increasing from $1,268,000 to $1,859,000. The increase in interest expense on deposits was the result of an 8 basis point increase in interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, which was partially offset by a 1.0% decrease in average balances of interest-bearing deposits.\nThe mix of deposits for the previous three years was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-interest-Bearing Demand\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,551\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n36.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n394,106\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n35.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n361,729\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n33.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-Bearing Demand (NOW)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n308,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n27.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n307,727\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n27.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n293,464\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n27.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings and MMDAs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n334,672\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n30.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n333,788\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n30.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n335,709\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n31.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n58,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n67,177\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n77,705\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,110,268\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,102,798\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,068,607\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan yields increased in 2019 and 2018 and deposit expense increased in 2019 and 2018. The Bank's net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets) was 4.00% in 2019 and 3.83% in 2018. The net spread between the rate for total earning assets and the rate for interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds increased 14 basis points from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the net spread was primarily due to an overall increase in interest rates on earning assets, which was partially offset by an increase in interest rates on interest-bearing deposits.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is established by charges to earnings based on management's overall evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. Based on this evaluation, the provision for loan losses decreased to $0 in 2019 from $2,100,000 in 2018, primarily due to limited loan growth coupled with improvements in credit quality and decreased non-performing assets and associated specific reserves in 2019. The amount of loans charged-off increased in 2019 to $779,000 from $685,000 in 2018, and recoveries increased to $313,000 in 2019 from $274,000 in 2018. The increase in charge-offs was due to an increase in charge-offs on commercial, agriculture and consumer loans, which was partially offset by a decrease in charge-offs on commercial real estate loans. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total loans at December 31, 2019 was 1.58% compared to 1.65% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more, net of guarantees was 1,311.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 250.4% at December 31, 2018.\nNon-Interest Income and Expenses\nNon-interest income consisted primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, net realized gains on loans held-for-sale, and other income. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $15,000 in 2019 over 2018. Net realized gains on loans held-for-sale increased $277,000 in 2019 over 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of loan sales. Other income decreased $291,000 in 2019 over 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income, which was partially offset by an increase in mortgage brokerage income.\nNon-interest expenses consisted primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, stationery and supplies expense, advertising and other expenses. Non-interest expenses increased to $33,940,000 in 2019 from $32,163,000 in 2018, representing an increase of $1,777,000, or 5.5%.\nFollowing is an analysis of the increase or decrease in the components of non-interest expenses (dollars in thousands) during the periods specified:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 over 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and Employee Benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,151\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOccupancy and Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nData Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n28.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStationery and Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(94\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(24.2\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdvertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n16.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirectors Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(9\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3.0\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOREO Expense and Impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,221.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(616\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(11.6\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,777\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2019 was primarily due to a 7% increase in regular salaries, a 29% increase in commissions and a 16% increase in group insurance. The increase in regular salaries expense and group insurance was primarily due to current year salary increases and an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees, which was partially due to staffing hired for a new branch which opened in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in commissions was primarily due to an increase in mortgage originations. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to rent expense and other expenses associated with the opening of an administrative office space in the third quarter of 2019 and a new branch in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in data processing expense was primarily due to costs associated with enhanced IT infrastructure as a result of a decision to outsource core processing and network infrastructure to third parties. The increase in other real estate owned expense was primarily due to a writedown on an existing commercial real estate property that was sold prior to year-end 2019. The decrease in other expenses was primarily due to a reversal of FDIC assessments expense due to the receipt of credits applied in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and a decrease in amortization of low-income housing tax credit investments in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is primarily affected by the tax rate, the level of earnings before taxes and the level of tax-exempt income. In 2019, tax expense increased to $5,670,000 from $4,744,000 in 2018, due to an increase in income before taxes. Non-taxable municipal bond income was $300,000 and $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to generate cash at a reasonable cost to fulfill lending commitments and support asset growth, while satisfying the withdrawal demands of deposit customers and any debt repayment requirements. The Bank's principal sources of liquidity are core deposits and loan and investment payments and prepayments. Providing a secondary source of liquidity is the available-for-sale investment portfolio. The Company held $342,897,000 in total investment securities at December 31, 2019. Under certain deposit, borrowing, and other arrangements, the Company must hold and pledge investment securities as collateral. At December 31, 2019, such collateral requirements totaled approximately $37,943,000. As a smaller source of liquidity, the Bank can utilize existing credit arrangements.\nThe Company's primary source of liquidity on a stand-alone basis is dividends from the Bank. As discussed in Part I (Item 1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, dividends from the Bank are subject to regulatory and corporate law restrictions.\nLiquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Bank experiences seasonal swings in deposits, which impact liquidity. Management has sought to address these seasonal swings by scheduling investment maturities and developing seasonal credit arrangements with the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Funds lines of credit with correspondent banks. In addition, the ability of the Bank's real estate department to originate and sell loans into the secondary market has provided another tool for the management of liquidity. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not created any special purpose entities to securitize assets or to obtain off-balance sheet funding.\nThe liquidity position of the Bank is managed daily, thus enabling the Bank to adapt its position according to market fluctuations. Liquidity is measured by various ratios, the most common of which is the ratio of net loans (including loans held-for-sale) to deposits. This ratio was 67.9% on December 31, 2019 and 68.1% on December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank's ratio of core deposits to total assets was 86.9% and 88.7%, respectively. Core deposits include demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction deposits, savings and money market deposit accounts, and time deposits $250,000 or less. Core deposits are important in maintaining a strong liquidity position as they represent a stable and relatively low-cost source of funds. Management believes that the Bank's liquidity position was adequate in 2019. This is best illustrated by the change in the Bank's net non-core ratio, which explains the degree of reliance on non-core liabilities to fund long-term assets. At December 31, 2019, the Bank's net core funding dependence ratio, the difference between non-core funds, time deposits $250,000 or more and brokered time deposits under $250,000, and short-term investments to long-term assets, was (7.96%) as of December 31, 2019 and (12.14%) as of December 31, 2018. This ratio indicated at December 31, 2019, the Bank did not significantly rely upon non-core deposits and borrowings to fund the Bank's long-term assets, namely loans and investments. The Bank believes that by maintaining adequate volumes of short-term investments and implementing competitive pricing strategies on deposits, it can ensure adequate liquidity to support future growth. The Bank also believes that its liquidity position remains strong to meet both present and future financial obligations and commitments, events or uncertainties that have resulted or are reasonably likely to result in material changes with respect to the Bank's liquidity.\nCommitments\nThe following table details the amounts and expected maturities of commitments as of December 31, 2019 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Maturities by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n86,497\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n63,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,630\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,519\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13,667\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,544\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8,961\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAgriculture\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23,921\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14,494\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n4,857\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n4,449\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n22,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n20,104\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,133\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n50,925\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13,503\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5,551\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,946\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23,925\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommitments to sell loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStandby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,455\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,256\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n202,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,641\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,750\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,141\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. These loans have been sold to third parties without recourse, subject to customary default, representations and warranties, recourse for breaches of the terms of the sales contracts and payment default recourse.\nFinancial instruments, whose contract amounts represent credit risk at December 31 of the indicated years, were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUndisbursed loan commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n198,534\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n201,983\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStandby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,455\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2,974\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommitments to sell loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n202,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n205,527\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank expects its liquidity position to remain strong in 2020 as the Bank expects to continue to grow into existing markets. The stock market remained volatile this past year, but with the overall trend being favorable. While the Bank did not experience an outflow of deposits in 2019, the potential of outflows still exists if the stock market values continue to improve. Regardless of the outcome, the Bank believes that it has the means to provide adequate liquidity for funding normal operations in 2020.\nCapital\nThe Company believes a strong capital position is essential to the Company's continued growth and profitability. A solid capital base provides depositors and shareholders with a margin of safety, while allowing the Company to take advantage of profitable opportunities, support future growth and provide protection against any unforeseen losses.\nAt December 31, 2019, stockholders' equity totaled $132.9 million, an increase of $20.5 million from $112.5 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to net income of $14.7 million. Also affecting capital in 2019 was paid in capital in the amount of $0.6 million resulting from employee stock purchases and stock plan accruals. See the section entitled Business - Capital Standards\u201d for additional information.\nThe capital of the Company and the Bank historically have been maintained at a level that is in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized\u201d institution. The policy of annual stock dividends has, over time, allowed the Company to match capital and asset growth through retained earnings and a managed program of geographic growth.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nIntroduction\nThis overview highlights selected information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of changes in results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the Company and its subsidiary, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2019.\nOur subsidiary, First Northern Bank of Dixon, is a California state-chartered bank that derives most of its revenues from lending and deposit taking in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California. Interest rates, business conditions and customer confidence all affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition, the regulatory environment and competition can challenge our ability to generate those revenues.\nFinancial highlights for 2019 include:\nThe Company reported net income of $14.7 million for 2019, a 17.3% increase compared to net income of $12.6 million for 2018. Net income per common share for 2019 was $1.15, an increase of 16.2% compared to net income per common share of $0.99 for 2018. Net income per common share on a fully diluted basis was $1.14 for 2019, an increase of 17.5% compared to net income per common share on a fully diluted basis of $0.97 for 2018.\nNet interest income totaled $47.1 million for 2019, an increase of 6.3% from $44.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased average loan volumes and rates, increased investment securities volumes and rates, increased rates on interest bearing due from banks, increased average certificates of deposit volumes and rates, which was partially offset by decreased average due from banks volume and increased average interest-bearing transaction, savings and money market account volumes and rates.\nThere was no provision for loan losses in 2019 compared to provision for loan loss of $2.1 million in 2018. Net charge-offs were $466 thousand in 2019 compared to $411 thousand in 2018. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to limited loan growth coupled with improvements in credit quality and decreased non-performing assets and associated specific reserves.\nNon-interest income totaled $7.2 million for each of the periods ended in 2019 and 2018. Gain on sale of loans held-for sale and mortgage brokerage income increased in 2019 compared to 2018, which was partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $33.9 million for 2019, up 5.5% from $32.2 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits due to increased staffing levels, occupancy and equipment expense due to the opening of an administrative office space and a branch in the second half of 2019, data processing expenses as a result of enhanced IT infrastructure and outsourcing of core processing and other real estate owned expense primarily due to a write-down on other real estate owned. The increase in non-interest expenses was partially offset by a reversal of FDIC assessments expense due to the receipt of credits applied in the second half of 2019.\nThe Company reported total assets of $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 3.4% from $1.25 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nInvestments increased to $342.9 million as of December 31, 2019, a 9.0% increase from $314.6 million as of December 31, 2018. U.S. Treasury securities totaled $43.3 million as of December 31, 2019, down 14.7% from $50.7 million as of December 31, 2018; securities of U.S. government agencies and corporations totaled $53.9 million, up 28.1% from $42.1 million as of December 31, 2018; obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled $27.0 million, up 41.0% from $19.2 million as of December 31, 2018; collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $79.4 million, up 24.5% from $63.8 million as of December 31, 2018; and mortgage-backed securities totaled $139.3 million, up 0.3% from $138.9 million as of December 31, 2018.\nLoans (including loans held-for-sale), net of allowance, increased to $773.0 million as of December 31, 2019, a 1.0% increase from $765.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Commercial loans totaled $106.1 million as of December 31, 2019, down 15.2% from $125.2 million as of December 31, 2018; commercial real estate loans were $451.8 million, up 7.5% from $420.1 million as of December 31, 2018; agriculture loans were $115.8 million, down 6.4% from $123.6 million as of December 31, 2018; residential mortgage loans were $64.9 million, up 27.2% from $51.1 million as of December 31, 2018; residential construction loans were $15.2 million, down 24.4% from $20.1 million as of December 31, 2018; and consumer loans totaled $26.8 million, down 24.2% from $35.4 million as of December 31, 2018.\nDeposits increased to $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2019, a 1.3% increase from $1.12 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nStockholders' equity increased to $132.9 million as of December 31, 2019, an 18.2% increase from $112.5 million as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the allowance for loan losses, other real estate owned, investments, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company believes the allowance for loan losses accounting policy is critical because the loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the consolidated balance sheet, and there is significant judgment used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required loan payments. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses is based on the Company's periodic evaluation of the factors mentioned below, as well as other pertinent factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and a general component. The components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate. The allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. The specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The historical loan loss element is determined using analysis that examines loss experience.\nThe allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume. The general portion of the allowance reflects the Company's estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower's financial condition, the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates, and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors. Uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss. There are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses; some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although the Company believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from Company estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods.\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. For a loan that has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement, not the contractual terms specified by the restructuring agreement. An impaired loan is measured based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an impairment is recognized by a charge to the allowance for loan losses.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment in Debt Securities\nDebt securities with fair values that are less than amortized cost are considered impaired. Impairment may result from either a decline in the financial condition of the issuing entity or, in the case of fixed interest rate debt securities, from rising interest rates. At each consolidated financial statement date, management assesses each debt security in an unrealized loss position to determine if impaired debt securities are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other than temporary. This assessment includes consideration regarding the duration and severity of impairment, the credit quality of the issuer and a determination of whether the Company intends to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. Other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings if one of the following conditions exists: 1) the Company's intent is to sell the security; 2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the impairment is recovered; or 3) the Company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis. If, by contrast, the Company does not intend to sell the security and will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes only the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment in earnings. The credit loss component is calculated as the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of the future expected cash flows is deemed to be due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a non-recurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally corresponds with the Company's quarterly valuation process. For additional discussion, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nShare-Based Payment\nThe Company determines the fair value of stock options at grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock-based award and stock price volatility. The estimates used in the model involve inherent uncertainties and the application of Management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from that reflected in these financial statements. The fair value of non-vested restricted common shares generally equals the stock price at grant date. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those share-based awards expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be materially different. For additional discussion, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes reported in the consolidated financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach. We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets, Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, Management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business. The Company files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns.\nA \"more-likely-than-not\" recognition threshold must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, an enterprise may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. To the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions, our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities. For additional discussion, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nTransfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities are accounted for and reported based on consistent application of a financial-components approach that focuses on control. Transfers of financial assets that are sales are distinguished from transfers that are secured borrowings. Retained interests (mortgage servicing rights) in loans sold are measured by allocating the previous carrying amount of the transferred assets between the loans sold and retained interest, if any, based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on a current market interest rate. The Company recognizes a gain and a related asset for the fair value of the rights to service loans for others when loans are sold.\nThe recorded value of mortgage servicing rights is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets initially at fair value, and is amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. The Company assesses capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment based upon the fair value of those rights at each reporting date. For purposes of measuring impairment, the rights are stratified based upon the product type, term and interest rates. Fair value is determined by discounting estimated net future cash flows from mortgage servicing activities using discount rates that approximate current market rates and estimated prepayment rates, among other assumptions. The amount of impairment recognized, if any, is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights for a stratum exceeds their fair value. Impairment, if any, is recognized through a valuation allowance for each individual stratum.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. These amendments align the guidance for fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance (Issue 1). This ASU also requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, Financial Services - Depository and Lending, to present all \"principal payments received under leases\" within investing activities (Issue 2). Finally, this ASU exempts both lessees and lessors from having to provide certain interim disclosures in the fiscal year in which a company adopts the new leases standard (Issue 3). Issue 1 and Issue 2 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Issue 3 is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted Issue 3 of ASU 2019-01 on January 1, 2019, which did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The guidance clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with the leases standard. The effective date and transition requirements are the same as the effective dates and transition requirements in the credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. On October 16, 2019, the FASB voted to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13 until January 1, 2023 for small reporting companies with less than $250 million in public float as defined in the SEC's rules. The Company qualifies for this delay in adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements. In that regard, the Company has formed a cross-functional working group, under the direction of our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Credit Officer. The working group is comprised of individuals from various functional areas including credit risk, finance and information technology, among others. The Company is currently working through its implementation plan which includes assessment and documentation of processes, internal controls and data sources; model development and documentation; and system configuration, among other things. The Company is also in the process of implementing a third-party vendor solution to assist us in the application of ASU 2016-13. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 could result in an increase in the Company's allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an incurred loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an expected loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 will necessitate that the Company establish an allowance for expected credit losses for certain debt securities and other financial assets. While the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, the Company expects that the impact of adoption will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of its loan and securities portfolios as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. These amendments clarify and improve areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognition and measurement. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These amendments provide entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized Cost, with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments-Overall, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of Topic 326. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. An entity that elects the fair value option should subsequently apply the guidance in Subtopics 820-10, Fair Value Measurement-Overall, and 825-10. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates. This\nASU amends the effective dates of ASU 2017-12 (Hedging); ASU 2016-13 (Credit Losses) and ASU 2016-02 (Leases). It pushes back by one year the effective date for all other entities, and also distinguishes that smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC are considered for purposes of ASU No. 2016-13 only, as an other entity. This standard was effective immediately. ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) was effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which resulted in the Company's recognition of a right-of-use asset of $4,417,000 included in Interest receivable and other assets and lease liabilities of $4,812,000 included in Interest payable and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by the SEC and as such, the Company is allowed to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) to January 1, 2023. See discussion above on the expected impact of ASU 2016-13.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This ASU, among other narrow-scope improvements, clarifies guidance around how to report expected recoveries. This ASU permits organizations to record expected recoveries on assets purchased with credit deterioration. In addition to other narrow technical improvements, the ASU also reinforces existing guidance that prohibits organizations from recording negative allowances for available-for-sale debt securities. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether certain exceptions apply in a given period. This ASU also improves financial statement preparers' application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: a) Franchise taxes that are partially based on income; b) Transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; c) Separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and d) Enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. For public business entities, ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nSTATISTICAL INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION\nThe following statistical information and discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included in Part II (Item 6) and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II (Item 8) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity, the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amount of interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Average loan balances include non-performing loans. Interest income includes proceeds from loans on non-accrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income. Tax-exempt income is not shown on a tax equivalent basis.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity;\nInterest Rates and Interest Differential\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n (1) Average balances for loans include loans held-for-sale and non-accrual loans and are net of the allowance for loan losses. \nNet Interest Earnings\nAverage Balances, Yields and Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n (1) Average balances for loans include loans held-for-sale and non-accrual loans and are net of the allowance for loan losses, but non-accrued interest thereon is excluded. Includes amortization of deferred loan fees and costs. \n (2) Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities are not presented on a taxable equivalent basis. \nContinuation of\nNet Interest Earnings\nAverage Balances, Yields and Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n(1) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average interest-earning assets.\n (2) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. \nAnalysis of Changes\nin Interest Income and Interest Expense\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFollowing is an analysis of changes in interest income and expense (dollars in thousands) for 2019 over 2018. Changes not solely due to interest rate or volume have been allocated proportionately to interest rate and volume.\n\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nComposition of Investment Securities\nThe mix of investment securities held by the Company at December 31 of the previous three fiscal years is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nMaturities of Investment Securities\nThe following table is a summary of the relative maturities (dollars in thousands) and projected yields of the Company's investment securities as of December 31, 2019. The yields on tax-exempt securities are shown on a tax equivalent basis.\nPeriod to Maturity\n\n\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\nComposition of Loans\nThe mix of loans, net of deferred origination fees and costs and allowance for loan losses and excluding loans held-for-sale, at December 31 for the previous five fiscal years is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nCommercial loans are primarily for financing the needs of a diverse group of businesses located in the Bank's market area. Commercial real estate loans generally fall into two categories, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied. Real estate construction loans are generally for financing the construction of single-family residential homes for individuals and builders we believe are well-qualified. These loans are secured by real estate and have short maturities. Residential mortgage loans, which are secured by real estate, include owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties in the Bank's market area. Loans are considered agriculture loans when the primary source of repayment is from the sale of an agricultural or agricultural-related product or service. Such loans are secured and/or unsecured to producers and processors of crops and livestock. The Bank also makes loans to individuals for investment purposes.\nAs shown in the comparative figures for loan mix during 2019 and 2018, total loans increased as a result of increases in commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans, which were partially offset by decreases in commercial loans, agriculture loans, residential construction loans and consumer loans.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nLoan maturities of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 are as follows (dollars in thousands) (excludes loans held-for-sale):\n\nNon-Accrual, Past Due, OREO and Restructured Loans\nIt is generally the Company's policy to discontinue interest accruals once a loan is past due for a period of 90 days as to interest or principal payments. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied against principal. A loan may only be restored to an accruing basis when it again becomes well secured and in the process of collection or all past due amounts have been collected and an appropriate period of performance has been demonstrated.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's non-accrual loans by loan category (dollars in thousands), net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S. Government, including its agencies and its government-sponsored agencies at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\n\n\nNon-accrual loans amounted to $1,157,000 at December 31, 2019 and were comprised of three commercial loans totaling $266,000, two commercial real estate loans totaling $466,000, one residential mortgage loan totaling $172,000 and four consumer loans totaling $253,000. Non-accrual loans amounted to $6,252,000 at December 31, 2018 and were comprised of two commercial loans totaling $750,000, two commercial real estate loans totaling $381,000, five agriculture loans totaling $4,830,000, two residential mortgage loans totaling $100,000, and one consumer loan totaling $191,000.\nIf interest on non-accrual loans had been accrued, such interest income would have approximated $139,000 and $377,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income actually recognized for these loans approximated $475,000 and $23,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in nonaccrual interest was primarily due to payoffs received on five loans during 2019 which resulted in recoveries of contractually due interest.\nLoans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Non-performing impaired loans are non-accrual loans and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing. Total non-performing impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, consisting of loans on non-accrual status totaled $1,157,000 and $6,252,000, respectively. A restructuring of a loan can constitute a troubled debt restructuring if the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. A loan that is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring is considered an impaired loan. Performing impaired loans, which consisted of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings, totaled $3,318,000 and $4,622,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company expects to collect all principal and interest due from performing impaired loans. These loans are not on non-accrual status. No assurance can be given that the existing or any additional collateral will be sufficient to secure full recovery of the obligations owed under these loans.\nThe Company had no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs the following table illustrates, total non-performing assets, which consists of loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90-days and still accruing and Other Real Estate Owned (\"OREO\") net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S. Government, including its agencies and its government-sponsored agencies, decreased $5,270,000, or 84.8%, to $942,000 from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets net of guarantees represent 0.1% and 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank's management believes that the $1,157,000 in non-accrual loans were appropriately reflected at their fair value at December 31, 2019. However, no assurance can be given that the existing or any additional collateral will be sufficient to secure full recovery of the obligations owed under these loans.\n\n\n\nOREO consists of property that the Company has acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure proceedings, and property that the Company does not hold title to but is in actual control of, known as in-substance foreclosure. The estimated fair value of the property is determined prior to transferring the balance to OREO. The balance transferred to OREO is the estimated fair value of the property less estimated cost to sell. Impairment may be deemed necessary to bring the book value of the loan equal to the appraised value. Appraisals or loan officer evaluations are then conducted periodically thereafter charging any additional impairment to the appropriate expense account. The Company had no OREO as of the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company had one commercial real estate property classified as OREO totaling $1,092,000 as of the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPotential Problem Loans\nThe Company manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan portfolio and through review processes that include analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination of outstanding loans and delinquencies, with particular attention to portfolio dynamics and loan mix. The Company strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early enough to correct the problems, to record charge-offs promptly based on realistic assessments of collectability and current collateral values and to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at all times. Asset quality reviews of loans and other non-performing assets are administered using credit risk rating standards and criteria similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulatory agencies. The federal banking regulatory agencies utilize the following definitions for assets adversely classified for supervisory purposes: Substandard Assets: a substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\u201d Doubtful Assets: An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\u201d Other Real Estate Owned\u201d and loans rated Substandard and Doubtful are deemed classified assets.\u201d This category, which includes both performing and non-performing assets, receives an elevated level of attention regarding collection.\nCommercial loans, whether secured or unsecured, generally are made to support the short-term operations and other needs of small businesses. These loans are generally secured by the receivables, equipment, and other real property of the business and are susceptible to the related risks described above. Problem commercial loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, and payment history of the borrower. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nCommercial real estate loans generally fall into two categories, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied. Loans secured by owner occupied real estate are primarily susceptible to changes in the market conditions of the related business. This may be driven by, among other things, industry changes, geographic business changes, changes in the individual financial capacity of the business owner, general economic conditions and changes in business cycles. These same risks apply to commercial loans whether secured by equipment, receivables or other personal property or unsecured. Problem commercial real estate loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, payment history of the borrower, and site inspections. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Losses on loans secured by owner-occupied real estate, equipment, or other personal property generally are dictated by the value of underlying collateral at the time of default and liquidation of the collateral. When default is driven by issues related specifically to the business owner, collateral values tend to provide better repayment support and may result in little or no loss. Alternatively, when default is driven by more general economic conditions, underlying collateral generally has devalued more and results in larger losses due to default. Loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate are primarily susceptible to risks associated with swings in occupancy or vacancy and related shifts in lease rates, rental rates or room rates. Most often, these shifts are a result of changes in general economic or market conditions or overbuilding and resultant over-supply of space. Losses are dependent on the value of underlying collateral at the time of default. Values are generally driven by these same factors and influenced by interest rates and required rates of return as well as changes in occupancy costs. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, sales invoices, or other appropriate means. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nAgricultural loans, whether secured or unsecured, generally are made to producers and processors of crops and livestock. Repayment is primarily from the sale of an agricultural product or service. Agricultural loans are generally secured by inventory, receivables, equipment, and other real property. Agricultural loans primarily are susceptible to changes in market demand for specific commodities. This may be exacerbated by, among other things, industry changes, changes in the individual financial capacity of the business owner, general economic conditions and changes in business cycles, as well as changing weather conditions. Problem agricultural loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns, crop budgets, payment history, and crop inspections. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nResidential mortgage loans, which are secured by real estate, are primarily susceptible to three risks; non-payment due to diminished or lost income, over-extension of credit, a lack of borrower's cash flow to sustain payments, and shortfalls in collateral value. In general, non-payment is due to loss of employment and follows general economic trends in the marketplace, particularly the upward movement in the unemployment rate, loss of collateral value, and demand shifts. Problem residential mortgage loans are generally identified via payment default. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nConstruction loans, whether owner occupied or non-owner occupied residential development loans, are not only susceptible to the related risks described above but the added risks of construction itself, including cost over-runs, mismanagement of the project, or lack of demand and market changes experienced at time of completion. Again, losses are primarily related to underlying collateral value and changes therein as described above. Problem construction loans are generally identified by periodic review of financial information that may include financial statements, tax returns and payment history of the borrower. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors, or repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nConsumer loans, whether unsecured or secured, are primarily susceptible to four risks: non-payment due to diminished or lost income, over-extension of credit, a lack of borrower's cash flow to sustain payments, and shortfall in collateral value. In general, non-payment is due to loss of employment and will follow general economic trends in the marketplace, particularly the upward movements in the unemployment rate, loss of collateral value, and demand shifts. Problem consumer loans are generally identified via payment default. Based on this information, the Company may decide to take any of several courses of action, including demand for repayment, requiring the borrower to provide a significant principal payment and/or additional collateral or requiring similar support from guarantors. Notwithstanding, when repayment becomes unlikely based on the borrower's income and cash flow, repossession or foreclosure of the underlying collateral may become necessary. Collateral values may be determined by appraisals obtained through Bank-approved, licensed appraisers, qualified independent third parties, purchase invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Appropriate valuations are obtained at origination of the credit and periodically thereafter (generally every 3-12 months depending on the collateral type and market conditions), once repayment is questionable, and the loan has been deemed classified.\nOnce a loan becomes delinquent or repayment becomes questionable, a Company collection officer will address collateral shortfalls with the borrower and attempt to obtain additional collateral or a principal payment. If this is not forthcoming and payment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement becomes unlikely, the Company will consider the loan to be impaired and will estimate its probable loss, using the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For collateral dependent loans, the Company will utilize a recent valuation of the underlying collateral less estimated costs of sale, and charge-off the loan down to the estimated net realizable amount. Depending on the length of time until final collection, the Company may periodically revalue the estimated loss and take additional charge-offs or specific reserves as warranted. Revaluations may occur as often as every 3-12 months depending on the underlying collateral and volatility of values. Final charge-offs or recoveries are taken when the collateral is liquidated and the actual loss is confirmed. Unpaid balances on loans after or during collection and liquidation may also be pursued through legal action and attachment of wages or judgment liens on the borrower's other assets.\nExcluding the non-performing loans cited previously, loans totaling $8,749,000 and $15,926,000 were classified as substandard or doubtful loans, representing potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Management's opinion, the potential loss related to these problem loans was sufficiently covered by the Bank's existing loan loss reserve (Allowance for Loan Losses) at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 1.58% and 1.65%, respectively.\nSUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE\nThe Company's allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, non-performing loans and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. A portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to classified loans whose full collectability is uncertain. Such allocations are determined by Management based on loan-by-loan analyses. In addition, loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends, grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent. Last, allocations are made to non-criticized and classified commercial loans and residential real estate loans based on historical loss rates, and other statistical data. The remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated. The unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance. It addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with Management's analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio, which are related to the risks of the Company's general lending activity. Included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have yet been recognized in past loan charge-off history (external factors). The external factors evaluated by the Company include: economic and business conditions, external competitive issues, and other factors. Also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the Company's loan portfolio and credit administration (internal factors). The internal factors evaluated by the Company include: loan review system, adequacy of lending Management and staff, loan policies and procedures, problem loan trends, concentrations of credit, and other factors. By their nature, these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify. Management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on Management's judgment as to the level of risk and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance. Management considered the $12,356,000 allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of December 31, 2019.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses has been established as a general component available to absorb probable inherent losses throughout the loan portfolio. The following table is an allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses balance on the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nThe Bank believes that any breakdown or allocation of the allowance into loan categories lends an appearance of exactness, which does not exist, because the allowance is available for all loans. The allowance breakdown shown above is computed taking actual experience into consideration but should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amount and allocation of actual charge-offs that may ultimately occur.\nDeposits\nThe following table sets forth the average amount and the average rate paid on each of the listed deposit categories (dollars in thousands) during the periods specified:\n\nThe following table sets forth by time remaining to maturity the Bank's time deposits over $250,000 (dollars in thousands) as of December 31, 2019:\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company had no secured borrowings and no Federal Funds purchased at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAdditional short-term borrowings available to the Company consist of a line of credit and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of FHLB stock and certain other qualifying collateral such as commercial and mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019, the Company had collateral borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $349,068,000 and at such date, also had unsecured Federal Funds lines of credit totaling $82,000,000 with correspondent banks.\nLong-Term Borrowings\nThe Company had no long-term borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Average outstanding balances of long-term borrowings were $0 during 2019 and 2018.\nSupplemental Compensation Plans\nThe Company and the Bank maintain an unfunded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan ( Salary Continuation Plan\u201d) and related split dollar plan for a select group of highly compensated employees. Eligibility to participate in the Salary Continuation Plan is limited to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Bank that are designated by the Board. Additionally, the Company and the Bank adopted a supplemental executive retirement plan ( SERP\u201d) in 2006. The SERP is intended to integrate the various forms of retirement payments offered to executives. There are currently three participants in the SERP. At December 31, 2019, the accrued benefit liability was $5,871,000, of which $3,891,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and $1,980,000 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2018, the accrued benefit liability was $5,322,000, of which $3,640,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and $1,682,000 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company and the Bank maintain an unfunded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan ( Directors' Retirement Plan\u201d) and related split dollar plan for the directors of the Bank. At December 31, 2019, the accrued benefit liability was $820,000, of which $798,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and $22,000 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2018, the accrued benefit liability was $787,000, of which $827,000 was recorded in interest payable and other liabilities and ($40,000) was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $14.7 million, representing an increase of $2.2 million, or 17.3%, compared to net income of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was principally attributable to a $3.4 million increase in interest income and $2.1 million decrease in provision for loan loss, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in interest expense, $1.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $0.9 million increase in provision for income taxes.\nTotal assets increased by $42.7 million, or 3.4%, to $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets was mainly due to a $28.3 million increase in investment securities, $7.3 million increase in net loans (including loans held-for-sale), a $7.1 million increase in certificates of deposit and a $5.2 million increase in interest receivable and other assets, which was partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million decrease in other real estate owned. Total deposits increased $14.0 million, or 1.3%, to $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the excess of interest and fees earned on the Bank's loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and banker's acceptances over the interest expense paid on deposits, mortgage notes and other borrowed funds which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is primarily affected by the yields on the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding during the period. The $2,785,000 increase in the Bank's net interest income in 2019 from 2018 was driven by both increased volumes and interest rates. Average investment securities growth was the primary driver from a volume perspective, contributing $519,000 in additional interest income compared to 2018. This was partially offset by a decrease of $321,000 in interest income due to a decrease in average due from bank balances. Increasing interest rates drove increases in interest income from loans and investments by $1,795,000 and $775,000, respectively, while the rates paid on interest bearing deposit accounts increased interest expense by $629,000. See Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense\u201d set forth on page 34 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the effects of interest rates and loan/deposit volume on net interest income.\nThe Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit, was 4.50% at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the prime rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September, and December) to end the year at 5.50%. During 2019, the prime rate decreased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of August, September, and October) to end the year at 4.75%. The effective federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, was 1.50% at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the effective federal funds rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the period at 2.50%. During 2019, the effective federal funds rate decreased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of July, September and October) to end the period at 1.75%.\nWe are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011. Nonetheless, we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result. However, as market interest rates have increased, we have increased the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products.\nThe nature and impact of future changes in interest rates and monetary policy on the business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted. For additional information, see The Effects of Changes or Increases in, or Supervisory Enforcement of, Banking or Other Laws and Regulations or Governmental Fiscal or Monetary Policies Could Adversely Affect Us\u201d in Risk Factors (Item 1A) of this Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest income on loans for 2019 was up 5.1% from 2018, increasing from $37,189,000 to $39,097,000. The increase in interest income on loans was the result of a 24 basis point increase in loan yields and 0.3% increase in average loan volume.\nInterest income on investment securities for 2019 was up 22.9% from 2018, increasing from $5,643,000 to $6,937,000. The increase in interest income on investment securities was the result of an 8.9% increase in average investment securities volume and a 25 basis point increase in investment securities yields. The Bank's strategy in 2019 was to use its excess cash to purchase investment securities and increase the investment portfolio. Investment securities yields were 2.17% and 1.92% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest income on interest-bearing due from banks for 2019 was down 0.7% from 2018, decreasing from $2,163,000 to $2,148,000. The decrease in interest income on interest-bearing due from banks was the result of a 13.8% decrease in average balances of interest-bearing due from banks, which was partially offset by a 29 basis point increase in yield on interest-bearing due from banks.\nInterest income on certificates of deposit for 2019 was up 241.4% from 2018, increasing from $104,000 to $355,000. The increase in interest income on certificates of deposit was the result of a 201.4% increase in average balances of certificates of deposit and a 33 basis point increase in yield on certificates of deposit.\nInterest expense on deposits for 2019 was up 46.6% from 2018, increasing from $1,268,000 to $1,859,000. The increase in interest expense on deposits was the result of an 8 basis point increase in interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, which was partially offset by a 1.0% decrease in average balances of interest-bearing deposits.\nThe mix of deposits for the previous three years was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nLoan yields increased in 2019 and 2018 and deposit expense increased in 2019 and 2018. The Bank's net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets) was 4.00% in 2019 and 3.83% in 2018. The net spread between the rate for total earning assets and the rate for interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds increased 14 basis points from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the net spread was primarily due to an overall increase in interest rates on earning assets, which was partially offset by an increase in interest rates on interest-bearing deposits.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is established by charges to earnings based on management's overall evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. Based on this evaluation, the provision for loan losses decreased to $0 in 2019 from $2,100,000 in 2018, primarily due to limited loan growth coupled with improvements in credit quality and decreased non-performing assets and associated specific reserves in 2019. The amount of loans charged-off increased in 2019 to $779,000 from $685,000 in 2018, and recoveries increased to $313,000 in 2019 from $274,000 in 2018. The increase in charge-offs was due to an increase in charge-offs on commercial, agriculture and consumer loans, which was partially offset by a decrease in charge-offs on commercial real estate loans. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total loans at December 31, 2019 was 1.58% compared to 1.65% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to total non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more, net of guarantees was 1,311.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 250.4% at December 31, 2018.\nNon-Interest Income and Expenses\nNon-interest income consisted primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, net realized gains on loans held-for-sale, and other income. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $15,000 in 2019 over 2018. Net realized gains on loans held-for-sale increased $277,000 in 2019 over 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of loan sales. Other income decreased $291,000 in 2019 over 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income, which was partially offset by an increase in mortgage brokerage income.\nNon-interest expenses consisted primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, stationery and supplies expense, advertising and other expenses. Non-interest expenses increased to $33,940,000 in 2019 from $32,163,000 in 2018, representing an increase of $1,777,000, or 5.5%.\nFollowing is an analysis of the increase or decrease in the components of non-interest expenses (dollars in thousands) during the periods specified:\n\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2019 was primarily due to a 7% increase in regular salaries, a 29% increase in commissions and a 16% increase in group insurance. The increase in regular salaries expense and group insurance was primarily due to current year salary increases and an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees, which was partially due to staffing hired for a new branch which opened in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in commissions was primarily due to an increase in mortgage originations. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to rent expense and other expenses associated with the opening of an administrative office space in the third quarter of 2019 and a new branch in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in data processing expense was primarily due to costs associated with enhanced IT infrastructure as a result of a decision to outsource core processing and network infrastructure to third parties. The increase in other real estate owned expense was primarily due to a writedown on an existing commercial real estate property that was sold prior to year-end 2019. The decrease in other expenses was primarily due to a reversal of FDIC assessments expense due to the receipt of credits applied in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and a decrease in amortization of low-income housing tax credit investments in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is primarily affected by the tax rate, the level of earnings before taxes and the level of tax-exempt income. In 2019, tax expense increased to $5,670,000 from $4,744,000 in 2018, due to an increase in income before taxes. Non-taxable municipal bond income was $300,000 and $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to generate cash at a reasonable cost to fulfill lending commitments and support asset growth, while satisfying the withdrawal demands of deposit customers and any debt repayment requirements. The Bank's principal sources of liquidity are core deposits and loan and investment payments and prepayments. Providing a secondary source of liquidity is the available-for-sale investment portfolio. The Company held $342,897,000 in total investment securities at December 31, 2019. Under certain deposit, borrowing, and other arrangements, the Company must hold and pledge investment securities as collateral. At December 31, 2019, such collateral requirements totaled approximately $37,943,000. As a smaller source of liquidity, the Bank can utilize existing credit arrangements.\nThe Company's primary source of liquidity on a stand-alone basis is dividends from the Bank. As discussed in Part I (Item 1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, dividends from the Bank are subject to regulatory and corporate law restrictions.\nLiquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Bank experiences seasonal swings in deposits, which impact liquidity. Management has sought to address these seasonal swings by scheduling investment maturities and developing seasonal credit arrangements with the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Funds lines of credit with correspondent banks. In addition, the ability of the Bank's real estate department to originate and sell loans into the secondary market has provided another tool for the management of liquidity. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not created any special purpose entities to securitize assets or to obtain off-balance sheet funding.\nThe liquidity position of the Bank is managed daily, thus enabling the Bank to adapt its position according to market fluctuations. Liquidity is measured by various ratios, the most common of which is the ratio of net loans (including loans held-for-sale) to deposits. This ratio was 67.9% on December 31, 2019 and 68.1% on December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank's ratio of core deposits to total assets was 86.9% and 88.7%, respectively. Core deposits include demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction deposits, savings and money market deposit accounts, and time deposits $250,000 or less. Core deposits are important in maintaining a strong liquidity position as they represent a stable and relatively low-cost source of funds. Management believes that the Bank's liquidity position was adequate in 2019. This is best illustrated by the change in the Bank's net non-core ratio, which explains the degree of reliance on non-core liabilities to fund long-term assets. At December 31, 2019, the Bank's net core funding dependence ratio, the difference between non-core funds, time deposits $250,000 or more and brokered time deposits under $250,000, and short-term investments to long-term assets, was (7.96%) as of December 31, 2019 and (12.14%) as of December 31, 2018. This ratio indicated at December 31, 2019, the Bank did not significantly rely upon non-core deposits and borrowings to fund the Bank's long-term assets, namely loans and investments. The Bank believes that by maintaining adequate volumes of short-term investments and implementing competitive pricing strategies on deposits, it can ensure adequate liquidity to support future growth. The Bank also believes that its liquidity position remains strong to meet both present and future financial obligations and commitments, events or uncertainties that have resulted or are reasonably likely to result in material changes with respect to the Bank's liquidity.\nCommitments\nThe following table details the amounts and expected maturities of commitments as of December 31, 2019 (amounts in thousands):\n\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. These loans have been sold to third parties without recourse, subject to customary default, representations and warranties, recourse for breaches of the terms of the sales contracts and payment default recourse.\nFinancial instruments, whose contract amounts represent credit risk at December 31 of the indicated years, were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe Bank expects its liquidity position to remain strong in 2020 as the Bank expects to continue to grow into existing markets. The stock market remained volatile this past year, but with the overall trend being favorable. While the Bank did not experience an outflow of deposits in 2019, the potential of outflows still exists if the stock market values continue to improve. Regardless of the outcome, the Bank believes that it has the means to provide adequate liquidity for funding normal operations in 2020.\nCapital\nThe Company believes a strong capital position is essential to the Company's continued growth and profitability. A solid capital base provides depositors and shareholders with a margin of safety, while allowing the Company to take advantage of profitable opportunities, support future growth and provide protection against any unforeseen losses.\nAt December 31, 2019, stockholders' equity totaled $132.9 million, an increase of $20.5 million from $112.5 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to net income of $14.7 million. Also affecting capital in 2019 was paid in capital in the amount of $0.6 million resulting from employee stock purchases and stock plan accruals. See the section entitled Business - Capital Standards\u201d for additional information.\nThe capital of the Company and the Bank historically have been maintained at a level that is in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized\u201d institution. The policy of annual stock dividends has, over time, allowed the Company to match capital and asset growth through retained earnings and a managed program of geographic growth.", "item_7_tables":

million in 2018, mainly due to higher interest income, lower provision for loan losses, and higher income tax expense. \n\n- Total assets grew 3.4% to $1.29 billion, driven by increases in investments, net loans, certificates of deposit, and interest receivable. Total deposits grew 1.3% to $1.14 billion.\n\n- Net interest income rose 6.3% to $47.1 million due to higher loan volumes and rates, growth in investments, and increased deposit rates. This was partially offset by lower interest-bearing due from banks. \n\n- Provision for loan losses fell to $0 from $2.1 million, reflecting limited loan growth, improved credit quality, and lower nonperforming assets.\n\n- Non-interest income was flat at $7.2 million as higher gains on loan sales were offset by lower other income. \n\n- Non-interest expenses increased 5.5% to $33.9 million, driven by higher salaries, occupancy, data processing, and OREO expenses.\n\n- The net interest margin rose to 4.00% from 3.83% in 2018. \n\n- The bank's capital position remains strong, with stockholders' equity rising 18.2% to $132.9 million."}
