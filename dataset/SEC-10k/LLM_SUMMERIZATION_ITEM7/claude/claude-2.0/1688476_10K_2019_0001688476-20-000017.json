Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information related to forward looking statements or information related to the basis of presentation and comparability of financial information, please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information\u201d and Basis of Presentation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\u201d, both of which immediately follow the table of contents of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nNexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. is an industry-leading U.S. land oilfield focused service company, with a diverse set of well completion and production services across a variety of active and demanding basins. We have a history of growth through acquisition, including (i) our 2017 acquisition of RockPile, a multi-basin provider of integrated well completion services in the U.S. whose primary service offerings included hydraulic fracturing, wireline perforation and workover rigs, and (ii) our 2018 asset acquisition from RSI to acquire approximately 90,000 hydraulic horsepower and related support equipment. Our most recent strategic transaction was the October 31, 2019, merger transaction with C&J Energy Services, Inc. ( C&J Merger\u201d), a publicly traded Delaware corporation. This history impacts the comparability of our operational results from year to year. See Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report for an overview of our history, including additional information on the acquisitions noted above, including the C&J Merger, our 2017 IPO, predecessor, and business environment. Additional information on these transactions can be found in Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d\nIndustry Overview\nWe provide our services in several of the most active basins in the United States, including the Permian, the Marcellus Shale/Utica, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken/Rockies. These regions are expected to account for approximately 73% of all new horizontal wells anticipated to be drilled through 2021. In addition, the high density of our operations in the basins in which we are most active provides us the opportunity to leverage our fixed costs and to quickly respond with what we believe are highly efficient, integrated solutions that are best suited to address customer requirements.\nIn particular, we are one of the largest providers of completion services in the Permian Basin, the most prolific and cost-competitive oil and natural gas basin in the United States. The Permian and the Marcellus Shale/Utica Basins are expected to account for 56% of total active rigs in the United States through 2022. These basins have experienced a recovery in activity since the spring of 2016, with an 156% increase in rig count from their combined second quarter of 2016 low of 185 to 475 as of December 31, 2019. Our financial performance is significantly affected by rig and well count in North America, as well as oil and natural gas prices, which are summarized in the tables below.\nActivity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas demand. Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices, global oil supply, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling activity.\nWhile it is too early to determine the impact, the recent actions taken by OPEC are expected to have a material negative impact on crude oil prices. Our customers' cash flows, in most instances, depend upon the revenue they generate from the sale of oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets. We are closely monitoring the situation including potential activity responses by our E&P customers.\nThe following table shows the average historical oil and natural gas prices for WTI and Henry Hub natural gas:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil price - WTI(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas price - Henry Hub(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Oil price measured in dollars per barrel\n(2) Natural gas price measured in dollars per million British thermal units (Btu), or MMBtu\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe historical average U.S. rig counts based on the weekly Baker Hughes Incorporated rig count information were as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Horizontal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vertical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Directional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of February 2020, global liquids demand is expected to average 101.7 million barrels per day in 2020. The EIA anticipates continued growth in the long-term U.S. domestic demand for natural gas, supported by various factors, including (i) increased likelihood of favorable regulatory and legislative initiatives, (ii) increased acceptance of natural gas as a clean and abundant domestic fuel source and (iii) the emergence of low-cost natural gas shale developments. As of February 2020, natural gas demand in the United States is expected to average 86.24 billion cubic feet per day in 2020.\nOperating Approach & Strategy\nWe believe our integrated approach and proven capabilities enable us to deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments, higher pressure rates and proppant intensity and multiple fracturing stages in challenging high-pressure formations. In addition, our technical team and our three innovation centers, provide us with the ability to supplement our service offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address customers' completion requirements and unique challenges.\nOur revenues and profits are generated by providing services and equipment to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells. Our results of operations in our core service lines are driven primarily by five interrelated, fluctuating variables: (1) the drilling, completion and production activities of our customers, which is primarily driven by oil and natural gas prices and directly affects the demand for our services; (2) the price we are able to charge for our services and equipment, which is primarily driven by the level of demand for our services and the supply of equipment capacity in the market; (3) the cost of materials, supplies and labor involved in providing our services, and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers; (4) our activity, or deployed equipment utilization\u201d levels; and (5) the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution.\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high utilization levels of deployed equipment to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the quality and efficiency of our service execution and aligning with customers who recognize the value that we provide through service quality and efficiency gains are central to our efforts to support equipment utilization and grow our business.\nHowever, equipment utilization cannot be relied on as wholly indicative of our financial or operating performance due to variations in revenue and profitability from job to job, the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle.\nHistorically, our utilization levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore spending by our customers, which is heavily driven by the price of oil and natural gas. Generally, as capital spending by our customers increases, drilling, completion and production activity also increases, resulting in increased demand for our services, and therefore more days or hours worked (as the case may be). Conversely, when drilling, completion and production activity levels decline due to lower spending by our customers, we generally provide fewer services, which results in fewer days or hours worked (as the case may be). Additionally, during periods of decreased spending by our customers, we may be required to discount our rates or provide other pricing concessions to remain competitive and support deployed equipment utilization, which negatively impacts our revenue and operating margins. During periods of pricing weakness for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, and our ability to achieve any cost reductions from our suppliers typically lags behind the decline in pricing for our services, which could further adversely affect our results. Furthermore, when demand for our services increases following a period of low demand, our ability to capitalize on such increased demand may be delayed while we reengage and redeploy equipment and crews that have been idled during a downturn. The mix of customers that we are working for, as well as limited periods of exposure to the spot market, also impacts our deployed equipment utilization.\nOur Reportable Segments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were organized into three reportable segments:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completion Services, which consists of the following businesses and services lines: (1) hydraulic fracturing; (2) wireline and pumpdown services; and (3) completion support services, which includes our innovation centers and activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Well Construction and Intervention Services, which consists of the following businesses and service lines: (1) cementing services and (2) coiled tubing services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Well Support Services, which consists of the following businesses and service lines: (1) rig services; (2) fluids management; and (3) other special well site services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Completion Services\nThe core services provided through our Completion Services segment are hydraulic fracturing, wireline and pumpdown services. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 45 hydraulic fracturing fleets, 118 wireline trucks and 80 pumpdown units capable of being deployed. Our completion support services are focused on supporting the efficiency, reliability and quality of our operations. Our Innovation Centers provide in-house manufacturing capabilities that help to reduce operating cost and enable us to offer more technologically advanced and efficiency focused completion services, which we believe is a competitive differentiator. For example, through our Innovation Centers we manufacture the data control instruments used in our fracturing operations and the perforating guns and addressable switches used in our wireline operations; these products are also available for sale to third-parties. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our fracturing business.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nThe core services provided through our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment are cementing and coiled tubing services. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our cementing business. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 25 coiled tubing units and 101 cementing units capable of being deployed.\nWell Support Services\nOur Well Support Services segment was divested in a transaction that closed on March 9, 2020. It focused on post-completion activities at the well site, including rig services, such as workover and plug and abandonment, fluids management services, and other specialty well site services. Since early 2017, in response to the highly competitive landscape and reflecting our returns-focused strategy, we had focused on operational rightsizing measures to better align these businesses with current market conditions. This strategy resulted in closing facilities and idling unproductive equipment. For example, we either sold or shut down numerous businesses or asset packages, which included the divestiture of the majority of our fluids management assets in both West and South Texas in the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 276 workover rigs and 348 fluids management trucks capable of being deployed. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our rig services business, and we consider rig services and fluids management to be the primary businesses within this segment.\nHow we calculate utilization for each segment\nOur management team monitors asset utilization, among other factors, for purposes of assessing our overall activity levels and customer demand. For our Completion Services segment, asset utilization levels for our own fleets is defined as the ratio of the average number of deployed fleets to the number of total fleets for a given time period. We define active fleets as fleets available for deployment; we consider one of our fleets deployed if the fleet has been put in service at least one day during the period for which we calculate utilization; and we define fully-\nutilized fleets per month as fleets that were deployed and working with our customers for a significant portion of a given month. As a result, as additional fleets are incrementally deployed, our utilization rate increases. We define industry utilization of fracturing assets as the ratio of the total industry demand of hydraulic horsepower to the total available capacity of hydraulic horsepower, in each case as reported by an independent industry source. Our method for calculating the utilization rate for our own fracturing fleets or the industry may differ from the method used by other companies or industry sources which could, for example, be based off a ratio of the total number of days a fleet is put in service to the total number of days in the relevant period. We believe that our measures of utilization, based on the number of deployed fleets, provide an accurate representation of existing, available capacity for additional revenue generating activity.\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, we measure our asset utilization levels for our cementing business primarily by the total number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month. In our coiled tubing business, we measure certain asset utilization levels by the hour to better understand measures between daylight and 24-hour operations. Both the financial and operating performance of our coiled tubing and cement units can vary in revenue and profitability from job to job depending on the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed.\nIn our Well Support Services segment, we measured asset utilization levels primarily by the number of hours our assets work on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month.\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the safety, quality and efficiency of our service execution and our alignment with customers who recognize the value that we provide are central to our efforts to support utilization and grow our business. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle.

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from our Completion Services, Well Construction and Intervention Services and Well Support Services segments. Revenue in 2019 decreased by $315.5 million, or 15%, to $1.8 billion from $2.1 billion in 2018. The net decline was driven primarily by a decrease in rig count and fleet utilization, combined with pricing pressures from macroeconomic market conditions. This decrease in utilization was primarily from our customers shifting their focus to capital discipline through reduced activity levels and pricing. Despite pricing pressures, we retained our core customer base by aligning with high quality and efficient customers under dedicated agreements. This change in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue decreased by $391.0 million, or 19%, to $1.7 billion in 2019 from $2.1 billion in 2018. The segment revenue decline was driven by lower fleet utilization and decreased activity levels year over year, in addition to continued pricing pressures from market conditions. This was offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the C&J Merger.\nWell Construction and Intervention: Well Construction and Intervention Services segment revenue increased by $27.0 million, or 75%, to $63.0 million in 2019 from $36.1 million in 2018. This increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the C&J Merger.\nWell Support Services: Well Support Services segment revenue was $48.6 million in 2019 with no comparison period in 2018. This increase in revenue was solely attributable to the acquisition of the segment through the C&J Merger.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2019 decreased by $256.6 million, or 15%, to $1.4 billion from $1.7 billion in 2018. This change was driven by several factors including lower overall activity and fleet utilization, as discussed above under Revenue, in addition to the impact of cost optimization from cost management efforts and input cost deflation.\nEquipment Utilization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $33.0 million, or 13%, to $292.2 million in 2019 from $259.1 million in 2018. The change in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to additional equipment purchases from the RSI Acquisition in late 2018, maintenance spend for fleet readiness, and other equipment used for continuing to enhance safety and efficiency through our multi-faceted approach of surface, digital and downhole technologies. Loss on disposal of assets in 2019 decreased by $0.6 million, to a loss of $4.5 million in 2019 from a loss of $5.0 million in 2018. The decrease in loss on disposal of assets is primarily related to a larger number of early failures of major components in 2018 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher activity and use of equipment in 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $9.9 million, or 9%, to $123.7 million in 2019 from $113.8 million in 2018. This change in SG&A was primarily related to non-cash compensation expense of $19.4 million and litigation contingencies of $3.8 million.\nMerger and integration expense. Merger and integration expense increased by $68.3 million to $68.7 million in 2019 from $0.4 million in 2018. The $68.7 million in merger and integration expense in 2019 was due to the C&J Merger, which consisted primarily of professional services, severance costs, and facility consolidation. The $0.4 million in 2018 is related to transaction cost associated with the RSI Acquisition.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, in 2019 increased by $1.4 million, or 150%, to income of $0.5 million in 2019 from expense of $0.9 million in 2018. In 2018, other expense, net was primarily due to a $13.2 million adjustment to our Rockpile CVR liability, $2.7 million loss on foreign currency related to the wind-down of the Canadian entity, offset by a $14.9 million gain on the insurance proceeds received for losses resulting from the July 1, 2018 accidental fire.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $11.6 million, or 35%, to $21.9 million in 2019 from $33.5 million in 2018. This change was primarily attributable to the $7.6 million write-offs of deferred financing costs in 2018, in connection with the debt extinguishment of our 2017 Term Loan Facility.\nEffective tax rate. Upon consummation of the IPO, the Company became a corporation subject to federal income taxes. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2019 was (0.96)%, as compared to 6.71% in 2018. For 2019, the effective rate is primarily made up of state taxes and a tax benefit derived from the current period operating loss offset by a valuation allowance. For 2018, the effective rate was primarily made up of state taxes and tax benefits derived from the current period operating income offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of market conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate as it is not more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets. The remaining tax impact not offset by a valuation allowance is related to indefinite-lived assets.\nIndustry Drivers of 2019 Operations\nBetween January and April 2019, the increase in oil prices incentivized many of our customers to significantly increase activity levels early in 2019. This resulted in E&P capital budget exhaustion and early\nachievement of E&P production targets, and in combination with normal year-end seasonality, resulted in softening demand for completions services by the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, lackluster oil and gas prices in 2019 resulted in the E&P budgeting process to be more muted, causing many E&P companies to delay activity start-up into early 2020. Furthermore, the current market oversupply of fracturing equipment created a competitive pricing environment at year-end 2019 during E&P budgeting season, which resulted in pricing pressure in order win new work or extend existing dedicated agreements that were up for renewal. With that said, most of our customers see value in a long-term partnership with us, and as a result, traded some price concessions by us for extended terms or additional work scope.\nWe are committed to continuing to manage our business in line with demand for our services and make adjustments as necessary to effectively respond to changes in market conditions, customer activity levels, pricing for our services and equipment, and utilization of our deployed equipment and personnel. Our response to the industry's persistent uncertainty is to maintain sufficient liquidity, preserve our conservative capital structure and closely monitor our discretionary spending. We take a measured approach to asset deployment, balancing our view of current and expected customer activity levels with a focus on generating positive returns for our shareholders. Our priorities remain to drive revenue by maximizing deployed equipment utilization, to improve margins through cost controls, to protect and grow our market share by focusing on the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution, and to ensure that we are strategically positioned to capitalize on constructive market dynamics.\nLooking Ahead to 2020\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Although many factors contributing to these risks are beyond our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable. In addition, while we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Please read the factors described in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information about the known material risks that we face.\nFiscal 2020 Objectives\nWith recent commodity price volatility, we intend to closely monitor the market and will adjust our approach as the situation develops. At this time, in 2020, our principal business objective continues to be growing our business and safely providing best-in-class services in all of our operating segments, while delivering shareholder value and maintaining a disciplined capital deployment strategy. We expect to achieve our objective through:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>partnering and growing with well-capitalized customers under dedicated agreements who focus their efforts on safety, high-efficiency completions, continuous improvement and innovation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>allocating our assets to maximize utilization and returns, including diversification of geographies and commodities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maximizing profitability of fully-utilized fleets through leading-edge pricing and efficiencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investing in technology to further drive efficiencies, enable differentiation of service offerings, and reduce our overall cost structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>leveraging our flexible and scalable logistics infrastructure to provide assurance of supply at lowest landed cost;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>leveraging our platform to identify, retain and promote talent to sustain growth and support operational and commercial excellence; maintaining agreements with our existing strategic suppliers and identify and develop relationships with additional strategic suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and optimize efficiency;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintaining our conservative and flexible capital position, supporting continued growth and maintenance of active equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>gaining scale, enhancing our service offering, and capturing targeted cost synergies from the C&J Merger; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>returning capital to shareholders in a disciplined fashion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Completion Services\nIn our Completion Services segment, our strategy remains focused on deploying our market-ready fracturing fleets and bundling more of our wireline and pumpdown units with our deployed fracturing fleets and on a stand-alone basis. We are focused on increasing our dedicated fracturing fleet count with efficient customers that allow us to achieve high equipment utilization, which should result in improved financial performance. Additionally, we are focused on bundling more of our wireline and pumpdown units with our fracturing fleets to increase operational efficiencies and profitability. With that said, current market conditions remain challenging, and our primary focus remains to lower our overall cost structure by aligning with efficient, dedicated customers with deep inventories of work and proven track records of efficient operations, many of which we have created long-term relationships with over the past several years.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, our strategy remains focused on deploying our market-ready cementing equipment and two newbuild coiled tubing units that we will take delivery of in the first quarter of 2020. In our cementing business, even though market conditions remain challenged due to customers releasing drilling rigs and declining E&P capital spending in 2020, we remain focused on providing high-quality, timely service and deploying more of our stacked units with efficient customers with deep inventories of work in our core operating basins. We will stay focused on controlling costs, improving market share with an efficient customer base that plan to maintain stable drilling rig counts in 2020. In our coiled tubing business, we are focused on deploying two newbuild, large-diameter units into our core operating basins and increasing market share with large, efficient customers with deep inventories of completion-oriented work that will keep our new units highly utilized.\nWell Support Services\nWe divested our Well Support Services segment on March 9, 2020, for total consideration of $93.7 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity represents a company's ability to adjust its future cash flows to meet needs and opportunities, both expected and unexpected.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, net of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(114,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(297,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(250,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,746\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant sources and uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2019\nSources of cash:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating activities:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net cash generated by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $305.5 million was a result of our thoroughness in receiving collections from our customers and controlling costs.

Our ability to generate future cash flows is subject to a number of variables, many of which are outside of our control, including the drilling, completion and production activity by our customers, which is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d for additional discussion of certain factors that impact our results and the market challenges within our industry.\nOur primary uses of cash are for operating costs, capital expenditures, debt service and our stock repurchase program.\nCapital expenditures for 2020 are projected to be primarily related to maintenance capital spend to support our existing active fleets, wireline trucks, coil units, and cementing units.\nDebt service for the year ended December 31, 2020 is projected to be $30.9 million, of which $3.5 million is related to capital leases. We anticipate our debt service will be funded by cash flows from operations.\nOn December 11, 2019, the Company announced the board of directors approved a new $100 million capital return program, which includes a $50 million stock repurchase program through December 2020. No share repurchases were made under the share repurchase program in 2019. Although our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We anticipate any share repurchases will be funded by cash flows from operations.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nFinancial position in current market. As of December 31, 2019, we had $255.0 million of cash and a total of $303.8 million available under our revolving credit facility. We currently believe that our cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months, including for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital investments and stock repurchases.\nGuarantee agreements. Under the 2019 ABL Facility $31.8 million of letters of credit were outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nCustomer receivables. In line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. The majority of our trade receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity.

On the October 31, 2019, we, and certain of our other subsidiaries as additional borrowers and guarantors, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the 2019 ABL Facility\u201d) to the original Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2017, as amended December 22, 2017 (the 2017 ABL Facility\u201d).\nStructure. Our 2019 ABL Facility provides for a $450.0 million revolving credit facility (with a $100.0 million subfacility for letters of credit), subject to a borrowing base in accordance with the terms agreed between us and the lenders. In addition, subject to approval by the applicable lenders and other customary conditions, the 2019 ABL Facility allows for an additional increase in commitments of up to $200.0 million. The 2019 ABL Facility is subject to customary fees, guarantees of subsidiaries, restrictions and covenants, including certain restricted payments.\nMaturity. The loans arising under the initial commitments under the 2019 ABL Facility mature on October 31, 2024. The loans arising under any tranche of extended loans or additional commitments mature as specified in the applicable extension amendment or increase joinder, respectively.\nInterest. Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 ABL Facility, amounts outstanding under the 2019 ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group Holdings, LLC's option, (a) the base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 1.00%, (y) if the\naverage excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 0.75% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 0.50%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 2.00%, (y) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 1.75% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 1.50%, to a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group Holdings, LLC's option, (a) the base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 0.75%, (y) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 0.50% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 0.25%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 1.75%, (y) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 1.50% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 1.25%.\nFinancial Covenants. The 2019 ABL Facility requires that, under certain circumstances, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio not be lower than 1.0:1.0 as of the last day of the most recently completed four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements were required to have been delivered, including if excess availability (or liquidity if no loan or letter of credit, other than any letter of credit that has been cash collateralized, is outstanding) is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the loan cap and (ii) $30.0 million at any time. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\n2018 Term Loan Facility\nOn May 25, 2018, Keane Group and the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors (as defined below) entered into the 2018 Term Loan Facility with each lender from time to time party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The proceeds of the 2018 Term Loan Facility were used to refinance Keane Group's then-existing term loan facility and to repay related fees and expenses, with the excess proceeds to fund general corporate purposes.\nStructure. The 2018 Term Loan Facility provides for a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the loans incurred under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the 2018 Term Loans\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $337.6 million principal amount of 2018 Term Loans outstanding. In addition, subject to certain customary conditions, the 2018 Term Loan Facility allows for additional incremental term loans to be incurred thereunder in an amount equal to the sum of (a) $200.0 million plus the aggregate principal amount of voluntary prepayments of 2018 Term Loans made on or prior to the date of determination (less amounts incurred in reliance on the capacity described in this subclause (a)), plus (b) an unlimited amount, subject to, (x) in the case of debt secured on a pari passu basis with the 2018 Term Loans, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a first lien net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 2.00:1.00, (y) in the case of debt secured on a junior basis with the 2018 Term Loans, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a secured net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 3.00:1.00 and (z) in the case of unsecured debt, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a total net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 3.50:1.00.\nMaturity. May 25, 2025 or, if earlier, the stated maturity date of any other term loans or term commitments.\nAmortization. The 2018 Term Loans amortize in quarterly installments equal to 1.00% per annum of the aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding.\nInterest. The 2018 Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group's option, (a) the base rate plus 2.75%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 3.75%, subject to, on and after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, a pricing grid with three 0.25% per annum step-ups and one 0.25% per annum step-down determined based on total net leverage for the relevant period. Following a payment event of default, the 2018 Term Loans bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such 2018 Term Loans at such time plus an additional 2.00% per annum during the continuance of such event of default.\nPrepayments. The 2018 Term Loan Facility is required to be prepaid with: (a) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and other dispositions, subject to the terms of an intercreditor\nagreement between the agent for the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the agent for the 2019 ABL Facility and certain exceptions; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of debt incurrences or issuances (other than debt incurrences permitted under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, which exclusion is not applicable to permitted refinancing debt) and (c) 50% (subject to step-downs to 25% and 0%, upon and during achievement of certain total net leverage ratios) of excess cash flow in excess of a certain amount, minus certain voluntary prepayments made under the 2018 Term Loan Facility or other debt secured on a pari passu basis with the 2018 Term Loans and voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2019 ABL Facility to the extent the commitments under the 2019 ABL Facility are permanently reduced by such prepayments.\nGuarantees. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by the Company, Keane Frac, LP, KS Drilling, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco I, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC, and Keane Frac GP, LLC, and each subsidiary of the Company that will be required to execute and deliver a facility guaranty in the future pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors\u201d).\nSecurity. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan Facility are secured by (a) a first-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the assets of Keane Group and the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors to the extent not constituting ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as defined below) and (b) a second-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the accounts receivable, inventory, and frac iron equipment, and certain other assets and property related to the foregoing including certain chattel paper, investment property, documents, letter of credit rights, payment intangibles, general intangibles, commercial tort claims, books and records and supporting obligations of the borrowers and guarantors under the 2019 ABL Facility (the ABL Facility Priority Collateral\u201d).\nFees. Certain customary fees are payable to the lenders and the agents under the 2018 Term Loan Facility.\nRestricted Payment Covenant. The 2018 Term Loan Facility includes a covenant restricting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions. The 2018 Term Loan Facility provides that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may, among things, make cash dividends and other restricted payments in an aggregate amount during the life of the facility not to exceed (a) $100.0 million, plus (b) the amount of net proceeds received by Keane Group from the funding of the 2018 Term Loans in excess of the of such net proceeds required to finance the refinancing of the pre-existing term loan facility and pay fees and expenses related thereto and to the entry into the 2018 Term Loan Facility, plus (c) an unlimited amount so long as, after giving effect to such restricted payment, the total net leverage ratio would not exceed 2.00:1.00. In addition, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may make restricted payments utilizing the Cumulative Credit (as defined below), subject to certain conditions including, if any portion of the Cumulative Credit utilized is comprised of amounts under clause (b) of the definition thereof below, the pro forma total net leverage ratio being no greater than 2.50:1.00.\nCumulative Credit\u201d, generally, is defined as an amount equal to (a) $25.0 million, (b) 50% of consolidated net income of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries on a cumulative basis from April 1, 2018 (which cumulative amount shall not be less than zero), plus (c) other customary additions, and reduced by the amount of Cumulative Credit used prior to such time (whether for restricted payments, junior debt payments or investments).\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants. The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants (in each case, subject to customary exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility). The 2018 Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\nEvents of Default. The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions or special purpose entities.\nRelated Party Transactions\nOur board of directors has adopted a written policy and procedures (the Related Party Policy\u201d) for the review, approval and ratification of the related party transactions by the independent members of the audit and risk committee of our board of directors. For purposes of the Related Party Policy, a Related Party Transaction\u201d is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including the incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness or the guarantee of indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be reasonably expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (2) the company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any Related Party (as defined herein) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. All Related Party Transactions will be reviewed in accordance with the standards set forth in the Related Party Policy after full disclosure of the Related Party's interests in the transaction.\nThe Related Party Policy defines Related Party\u201d as any person who is, or, at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, was (1) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (2) a person with greater than five percent (5%) beneficial interest in the Company, (3) an immediate family member of any of the individuals or entities identified in (1) or (2) of this paragraph, and (4) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing individuals or entities is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person or entity has a five percent (5%) or greater beneficial interest. Immediate family members includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's home, other than a tenant or employee.\nTransaction prices with our related parties are commensurate with transaction prices in arms-length transactions. For further details about our transactions with Related Parties, see Note (19) Related Party Transactions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion on the impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted to our consolidated and combined financial statements, see Note (23) New Accounting Pronouncements of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nA critical accounting estimate is one that requires a high level of subjective judgment by management and has a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nBusiness combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of businesses we acquire to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows, multi-period excess earning or income-based-relief-from-royalty methods. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventories, identifiable long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets, as well as any contingent consideration or earn-out provisions that provide for additional consideration to be paid to the seller if certain future conditions are met. These estimates are reviewed during the 12-month measurement period and adjusted based on actual results. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our recently completed merger and acquisition during 2019 and 2017, respectively.\nAsset acquisitions\nAsset acquisitions are measured based on their cost to us, including transaction costs incurred by us. An asset acquisition's cost or the consideration transferred by us is assumed to be equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired. If the consideration transferred is cash, measurement is based on the amount of cash we paid to the seller, as well as transaction costs incurred by us. Consideration given in the form of nonmonetary assets, liabilities incurred or equity interests issued is measured based on either the cost to us or the fair value of the assets or net assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. The cost of an asset acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated relative fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventories, identifiable long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. See Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for our asset acquisition from RSI in 2018.\nLegal and environmental contingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations, claims and actions, as is typical of the industry. These claims include, but are not limited to, contract claims, environmental claims, employment related claims, claims alleging injury or claims related to operational issues. Our assessment of the likely outcome of litigation matters is based on our judgment of a number of factors, including experience with similar matters, past history, precedents, relevant financial information and other evidence and facts specific to the matter. We accrue for contingencies when the occurrence of a material loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, based on our best estimate of the expected liability. The estimate of probable costs related to a contingency is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. The accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. Differences between the actual settlement costs, final judgments or fines from our estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. See Note (18) Commitments and Contingencies of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our legal, environmental and other regulatory contingencies.\nValuation of long-lived assets, indefinite-lived assets and goodwill\nWe assess our long-lived assets, such as definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually, as of October 31, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or the indefinite-lived assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment charge that reduces our earnings.\nWe perform our qualitative assessments of the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors relevant to each of our reporting segments, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value\ncalculations are based on subjective, judgmental assessments of projected revenue growth, fleet count, utilization, gross margin rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Many of these judgments are driven by crude oil prices. If the crude oil market declines and remains at low levels for a sustained period of time, we would expect to perform our impairment assessments more frequently and could record impairment charges.\nSee Note (2)(h) Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and (2)(i) Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on our impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, indefinite-lived assets and goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are accounted for based upon the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carry-forwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. We estimate our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time, while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year-end. Our effective tax rates will vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income or losses, fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In addition to our historical financial results, we consider forecasted market growth, earnings and taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. We establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.\nWe calculate our income tax liability based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of our tax liabilities. These differences are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to, (1) the requirement to pay a one-time transition tax on all undistributed earnings of\nforeign subsidiaries; (2) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (3) eliminating the alternative minimum tax; (4) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (5) changing rules related to use and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We evaluated the provisions of the Tax Act and determined only the reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% would have an impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements as of December 31, 2017. Accordingly, we recorded a provision to income taxes for our assessment of the tax impact of the Tax Act on ending deferred tax assets and liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance. The effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are not expected to have an adverse impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements. We will continue to assess the impact of other aspects of U.S. tax reform on our tax positions and our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nSee Note (17) Income Taxes of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLeases\nPer ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" lessees can classify leases as finance leases or operating leases, while lessors can classify leases as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases. All leases, with the exception of short-term leases, are capitalized on the balance sheet by recording a lease liability, which represents our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, along with a corresponding right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset being leased. For leases in which we are the lessee, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability, as in most cases we do not know the lessor's implicit rate in the lease. Establishing our lease obligations on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets require judgmental assessments of the term lengths of each and the interest rate yield curve that best represents the collateralized incremental borrowing rate to apply to each lease. We engage third-party specialists to assist us in determining the collateralized incremental borrowing rate yield curve. Errors in determining the lease term lengths and/or selecting the best representative collateralized incremental borrowing rate can have a material adverse effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For further details about our leases, see Note (16) Leases of Part II, \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor discussion on the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted, see Note (23) New Accounting Pronouncements of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8.

For additional information related to forward looking statements or information related to the basis of presentation and comparability of financial information, please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information\u201d and Basis of Presentation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\u201d, both of which immediately follow the table of contents of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nNexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. is an industry-leading U.S. land oilfield focused service company, with a diverse set of well completion and production services across a variety of active and demanding basins. We have a history of growth through acquisition, including (i) our 2017 acquisition of RockPile, a multi-basin provider of integrated well completion services in the U.S. whose primary service offerings included hydraulic fracturing, wireline perforation and workover rigs, and (ii) our 2018 asset acquisition from RSI to acquire approximately 90,000 hydraulic horsepower and related support equipment. Our most recent strategic transaction was the October 31, 2019, merger transaction with C&J Energy Services, Inc. ( C&J Merger\u201d), a publicly traded Delaware corporation. This history impacts the comparability of our operational results from year to year. See Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report for an overview of our history, including additional information on the acquisitions noted above, including the C&J Merger, our 2017 IPO, predecessor, and business environment. Additional information on these transactions can be found in Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d\nIndustry Overview\nWe provide our services in several of the most active basins in the United States, including the Permian, the Marcellus Shale/Utica, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken/Rockies. These regions are expected to account for approximately 73% of all new horizontal wells anticipated to be drilled through 2021. In addition, the high density of our operations in the basins in which we are most active provides us the opportunity to leverage our fixed costs and to quickly respond with what we believe are highly efficient, integrated solutions that are best suited to address customer requirements.\nIn particular, we are one of the largest providers of completion services in the Permian Basin, the most prolific and cost-competitive oil and natural gas basin in the United States. The Permian and the Marcellus Shale/Utica Basins are expected to account for 56% of total active rigs in the United States through 2022. These basins have experienced a recovery in activity since the spring of 2016, with an 156% increase in rig count from their combined second quarter of 2016 low of 185 to 475 as of December 31, 2019. Our financial performance is significantly affected by rig and well count in North America, as well as oil and natural gas prices, which are summarized in the tables below.\nActivity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas demand. Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices, global oil supply, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling activity.\nWhile it is too early to determine the impact, the recent actions taken by OPEC are expected to have a material negative impact on crude oil prices. Our customers' cash flows, in most instances, depend upon the revenue they generate from the sale of oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets. We are closely monitoring the situation including potential activity responses by our E&P customers.\nThe following table shows the average historical oil and natural gas prices for WTI and Henry Hub natural gas:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil price - WTI(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas price - Henry Hub(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Oil price measured in dollars per barrel\n(2) Natural gas price measured in dollars per million British thermal units (Btu), or MMBtu\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe historical average U.S. rig counts based on the weekly Baker Hughes Incorporated rig count information were as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Horizontal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vertical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Directional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of February 2020, global liquids demand is expected to average 101.7 million barrels per day in 2020. The EIA anticipates continued growth in the long-term U.S. domestic demand for natural gas, supported by various factors, including (i) increased likelihood of favorable regulatory and legislative initiatives, (ii) increased acceptance of natural gas as a clean and abundant domestic fuel source and (iii) the emergence of low-cost natural gas shale developments. As of February 2020, natural gas demand in the United States is expected to average 86.24 billion cubic feet per day in 2020.\nOperating Approach & Strategy\nWe believe our integrated approach and proven capabilities enable us to deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments, higher pressure rates and proppant intensity and multiple fracturing stages in challenging high-pressure formations. In addition, our technical team and our three innovation centers, provide us with the ability to supplement our service offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address customers' completion requirements and unique challenges.\nOur revenues and profits are generated by providing services and equipment to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells. Our results of operations in our core service lines are driven primarily by five interrelated, fluctuating variables: (1) the drilling, completion and production activities of our customers, which is primarily driven by oil and natural gas prices and directly affects the demand for our services; (2) the price we are able to charge for our services and equipment, which is primarily driven by the level of demand for our services and the supply of equipment capacity in the market; (3) the cost of materials, supplies and labor involved in providing our services, and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers; (4) our activity, or deployed equipment utilization\u201d levels; and (5) the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution.\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high utilization levels of deployed equipment to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the quality and efficiency of our service execution and aligning with customers who recognize the value that we provide through service quality and efficiency gains are central to our efforts to support equipment utilization and grow our business.\nHowever, equipment utilization cannot be relied on as wholly indicative of our financial or operating performance due to variations in revenue and profitability from job to job, the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle.\nHistorically, our utilization levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore spending by our customers, which is heavily driven by the price of oil and natural gas. Generally, as capital spending by our customers increases, drilling, completion and production activity also increases, resulting in increased demand for our services, and therefore more days or hours worked (as the case may be). Conversely, when drilling, completion and production activity levels decline due to lower spending by our customers, we generally provide fewer services, which results in fewer days or hours worked (as the case may be). Additionally, during periods of decreased spending by our customers, we may be required to discount our rates or provide other pricing concessions to remain competitive and support deployed equipment utilization, which negatively impacts our revenue and operating margins. During periods of pricing weakness for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, and our ability to achieve any cost reductions from our suppliers typically lags behind the decline in pricing for our services, which could further adversely affect our results. Furthermore, when demand for our services increases following a period of low demand, our ability to capitalize on such increased demand may be delayed while we reengage and redeploy equipment and crews that have been idled during a downturn. The mix of customers that we are working for, as well as limited periods of exposure to the spot market, also impacts our deployed equipment utilization.\nOur Reportable Segments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were organized into three reportable segments:\n \u2022 Completion Services, which consists of the following businesses and services lines: (1) hydraulic fracturing; (2) wireline and pumpdown services; and (3) completion support services, which includes our innovation centers and activities. \n \u2022 Well Construction and Intervention Services, which consists of the following businesses and service lines: (1) cementing services and (2) coiled tubing services. \n \u2022 Well Support Services, which consists of the following businesses and service lines: (1) rig services; (2) fluids management; and (3) other special well site services.  Completion Services\nThe core services provided through our Completion Services segment are hydraulic fracturing, wireline and pumpdown services. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 45 hydraulic fracturing fleets, 118 wireline trucks and 80 pumpdown units capable of being deployed. Our completion support services are focused on supporting the efficiency, reliability and quality of our operations. Our Innovation Centers provide in-house manufacturing capabilities that help to reduce operating cost and enable us to offer more technologically advanced and efficiency focused completion services, which we believe is a competitive differentiator. For example, through our Innovation Centers we manufacture the data control instruments used in our fracturing operations and the perforating guns and addressable switches used in our wireline operations; these products are also available for sale to third-parties. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our fracturing business.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nThe core services provided through our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment are cementing and coiled tubing services. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our cementing business. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 25 coiled tubing units and 101 cementing units capable of being deployed.\nWell Support Services\nOur Well Support Services segment was divested in a transaction that closed on March 9, 2020. It focused on post-completion activities at the well site, including rig services, such as workover and plug and abandonment, fluids management services, and other specialty well site services. Since early 2017, in response to the highly competitive landscape and reflecting our returns-focused strategy, we had focused on operational rightsizing measures to better align these businesses with current market conditions. This strategy resulted in closing facilities and idling unproductive equipment. For example, we either sold or shut down numerous businesses or asset packages, which included the divestiture of the majority of our fluids management assets in both West and South Texas in the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 276 workover rigs and 348 fluids management trucks capable of being deployed. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our rig services business, and we consider rig services and fluids management to be the primary businesses within this segment.\nHow we calculate utilization for each segment\nOur management team monitors asset utilization, among other factors, for purposes of assessing our overall activity levels and customer demand. For our Completion Services segment, asset utilization levels for our own fleets is defined as the ratio of the average number of deployed fleets to the number of total fleets for a given time period. We define active fleets as fleets available for deployment; we consider one of our fleets deployed if the fleet has been put in service at least one day during the period for which we calculate utilization; and we define fully-\nutilized fleets per month as fleets that were deployed and working with our customers for a significant portion of a given month. As a result, as additional fleets are incrementally deployed, our utilization rate increases. We define industry utilization of fracturing assets as the ratio of the total industry demand of hydraulic horsepower to the total available capacity of hydraulic horsepower, in each case as reported by an independent industry source. Our method for calculating the utilization rate for our own fracturing fleets or the industry may differ from the method used by other companies or industry sources which could, for example, be based off a ratio of the total number of days a fleet is put in service to the total number of days in the relevant period. We believe that our measures of utilization, based on the number of deployed fleets, provide an accurate representation of existing, available capacity for additional revenue generating activity.\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, we measure our asset utilization levels for our cementing business primarily by the total number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month. In our coiled tubing business, we measure certain asset utilization levels by the hour to better understand measures between daylight and 24-hour operations. Both the financial and operating performance of our coiled tubing and cement units can vary in revenue and profitability from job to job depending on the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed.\nIn our Well Support Services segment, we measured asset utilization levels primarily by the number of hours our assets work on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month.\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the safety, quality and efficiency of our service execution and our alignment with customers who recognize the value that we provide are central to our efforts to support utilization and grow our business. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle.

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from our Completion Services, Well Construction and Intervention Services and Well Support Services segments. Revenue in 2019 decreased by $315.5 million, or 15%, to $1.8 billion from $2.1 billion in 2018. The net decline was driven primarily by a decrease in rig count and fleet utilization, combined with pricing pressures from macroeconomic market conditions. This decrease in utilization was primarily from our customers shifting their focus to capital discipline through reduced activity levels and pricing. Despite pricing pressures, we retained our core customer base by aligning with high quality and efficient customers under dedicated agreements. This change in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue decreased by $391.0 million, or 19%, to $1.7 billion in 2019 from $2.1 billion in 2018. The segment revenue decline was driven by lower fleet utilization and decreased activity levels year over year, in addition to continued pricing pressures from market conditions. This was offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the C&J Merger.\nWell Construction and Intervention: Well Construction and Intervention Services segment revenue increased by $27.0 million, or 75%, to $63.0 million in 2019 from $36.1 million in 2018. This increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the C&J Merger.\nWell Support Services: Well Support Services segment revenue was $48.6 million in 2019 with no comparison period in 2018. This increase in revenue was solely attributable to the acquisition of the segment through the C&J Merger.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2019 decreased by $256.6 million, or 15%, to $1.4 billion from $1.7 billion in 2018. This change was driven by several factors including lower overall activity and fleet utilization, as discussed above under Revenue, in addition to the impact of cost optimization from cost management efforts and input cost deflation.\nEquipment Utilization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $33.0 million, or 13%, to $292.2 million in 2019 from $259.1 million in 2018. The change in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to additional equipment purchases from the RSI Acquisition in late 2018, maintenance spend for fleet readiness, and other equipment used for continuing to enhance safety and efficiency through our multi-faceted approach of surface, digital and downhole technologies. Loss on disposal of assets in 2019 decreased by $0.6 million, to a loss of $4.5 million in 2019 from a loss of $5.0 million in 2018. The decrease in loss on disposal of assets is primarily related to a larger number of early failures of major components in 2018 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher activity and use of equipment in 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $9.9 million, or 9%, to $123.7 million in 2019 from $113.8 million in 2018. This change in SG&A was primarily related to non-cash compensation expense of $19.4 million and litigation contingencies of $3.8 million.\nMerger and integration expense. Merger and integration expense increased by $68.3 million to $68.7 million in 2019 from $0.4 million in 2018. The $68.7 million in merger and integration expense in 2019 was due to the C&J Merger, which consisted primarily of professional services, severance costs, and facility consolidation. The $0.4 million in 2018 is related to transaction cost associated with the RSI Acquisition.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, in 2019 increased by $1.4 million, or 150%, to income of $0.5 million in 2019 from expense of $0.9 million in 2018. In 2018, other expense, net was primarily due to a $13.2 million adjustment to our Rockpile CVR liability, $2.7 million loss on foreign currency related to the wind-down of the Canadian entity, offset by a $14.9 million gain on the insurance proceeds received for losses resulting from the July 1, 2018 accidental fire.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $11.6 million, or 35%, to $21.9 million in 2019 from $33.5 million in 2018. This change was primarily attributable to the $7.6 million write-offs of deferred financing costs in 2018, in connection with the debt extinguishment of our 2017 Term Loan Facility.\nEffective tax rate. Upon consummation of the IPO, the Company became a corporation subject to federal income taxes. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2019 was (0.96)%, as compared to 6.71% in 2018. For 2019, the effective rate is primarily made up of state taxes and a tax benefit derived from the current period operating loss offset by a valuation allowance. For 2018, the effective rate was primarily made up of state taxes and tax benefits derived from the current period operating income offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of market conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate as it is not more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets. The remaining tax impact not offset by a valuation allowance is related to indefinite-lived assets.\nIndustry Drivers of 2019 Operations\nBetween January and April 2019, the increase in oil prices incentivized many of our customers to significantly increase activity levels early in 2019. This resulted in E&P capital budget exhaustion and early\nachievement of E&P production targets, and in combination with normal year-end seasonality, resulted in softening demand for completions services by the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, lackluster oil and gas prices in 2019 resulted in the E&P budgeting process to be more muted, causing many E&P companies to delay activity start-up into early 2020. Furthermore, the current market oversupply of fracturing equipment created a competitive pricing environment at year-end 2019 during E&P budgeting season, which resulted in pricing pressure in order win new work or extend existing dedicated agreements that were up for renewal. With that said, most of our customers see value in a long-term partnership with us, and as a result, traded some price concessions by us for extended terms or additional work scope.\nWe are committed to continuing to manage our business in line with demand for our services and make adjustments as necessary to effectively respond to changes in market conditions, customer activity levels, pricing for our services and equipment, and utilization of our deployed equipment and personnel. Our response to the industry's persistent uncertainty is to maintain sufficient liquidity, preserve our conservative capital structure and closely monitor our discretionary spending. We take a measured approach to asset deployment, balancing our view of current and expected customer activity levels with a focus on generating positive returns for our shareholders. Our priorities remain to drive revenue by maximizing deployed equipment utilization, to improve margins through cost controls, to protect and grow our market share by focusing on the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution, and to ensure that we are strategically positioned to capitalize on constructive market dynamics.\nLooking Ahead to 2020\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Although many factors contributing to these risks are beyond our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable. In addition, while we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Please read the factors described in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information about the known material risks that we face.\nFiscal 2020 Objectives\nWith recent commodity price volatility, we intend to closely monitor the market and will adjust our approach as the situation develops. At this time, in 2020, our principal business objective continues to be growing our business and safely providing best-in-class services in all of our operating segments, while delivering shareholder value and maintaining a disciplined capital deployment strategy. We expect to achieve our objective through:\n \u2022 partnering and growing with well-capitalized customers under dedicated agreements who focus their efforts on safety, high-efficiency completions, continuous improvement and innovation; \n \u2022 allocating our assets to maximize utilization and returns, including diversification of geographies and commodities; \n \u2022 maximizing profitability of fully-utilized fleets through leading-edge pricing and efficiencies; \n \u2022 investing in technology to further drive efficiencies, enable differentiation of service offerings, and reduce our overall cost structure; \n \u2022 leveraging our flexible and scalable logistics infrastructure to provide assurance of supply at lowest landed cost; \n \u2022 leveraging our platform to identify, retain and promote talent to sustain growth and support operational and commercial excellence; maintaining agreements with our existing strategic suppliers and identify and develop relationships with additional strategic suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and optimize efficiency; \n \u2022 maintaining our conservative and flexible capital position, supporting continued growth and maintenance of active equipment; \n \u2022 gaining scale, enhancing our service offering, and capturing targeted cost synergies from the C&J Merger; and \n \u2022 returning capital to shareholders in a disciplined fashion.  Completion Services\nIn our Completion Services segment, our strategy remains focused on deploying our market-ready fracturing fleets and bundling more of our wireline and pumpdown units with our deployed fracturing fleets and on a stand-alone basis. We are focused on increasing our dedicated fracturing fleet count with efficient customers that allow us to achieve high equipment utilization, which should result in improved financial performance. Additionally, we are focused on bundling more of our wireline and pumpdown units with our fracturing fleets to increase operational efficiencies and profitability. With that said, current market conditions remain challenging, and our primary focus remains to lower our overall cost structure by aligning with efficient, dedicated customers with deep inventories of work and proven track records of efficient operations, many of which we have created long-term relationships with over the past several years.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, our strategy remains focused on deploying our market-ready cementing equipment and two newbuild coiled tubing units that we will take delivery of in the first quarter of 2020. In our cementing business, even though market conditions remain challenged due to customers releasing drilling rigs and declining E&P capital spending in 2020, we remain focused on providing high-quality, timely service and deploying more of our stacked units with efficient customers with deep inventories of work in our core operating basins. We will stay focused on controlling costs, improving market share with an efficient customer base that plan to maintain stable drilling rig counts in 2020. In our coiled tubing business, we are focused on deploying two newbuild, large-diameter units into our core operating basins and increasing market share with large, efficient customers with deep inventories of completion-oriented work that will keep our new units highly utilized.\nWell Support Services\nWe divested our Well Support Services segment on March 9, 2020, for total consideration of $93.7 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity represents a company's ability to adjust its future cash flows to meet needs and opportunities, both expected and unexpected.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, net of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(114,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(297,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(250,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,746\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant sources and uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2019\nSources of cash:\n \u2022 Operating activities: \n - Net cash generated by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $305.5 million was a result of our thoroughness in receiving collections from our customers and controlling costs.

We used a portion of our IPO proceeds and the proceeds of the 2017 Term Loan Facility to repay our 2016 Term Loan Facility and Senior Secured Notes.  Future sources and use of cash\nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically included, and we have funded our capital expenditures with, cash flows from operations, proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under debt facilities. Our ability to generate future cash flows is subject to a number of variables, many of which are outside of our control, including the drilling, completion and production activity by our customers, which is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d for additional discussion of certain factors that impact our results and the market challenges within our industry.\nOur primary uses of cash are for operating costs, capital expenditures, debt service and our stock repurchase program.\nCapital expenditures for 2020 are projected to be primarily related to maintenance capital spend to support our existing active fleets, wireline trucks, coil units, and cementing units.\nDebt service for the year ended December 31, 2020 is projected to be $30.9 million, of which $3.5 million is related to capital leases. We anticipate our debt service will be funded by cash flows from operations.\nOn December 11, 2019, the Company announced the board of directors approved a new $100 million capital return program, which includes a $50 million stock repurchase program through December 2020. No share repurchases were made under the share repurchase program in 2019. Although our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We anticipate any share repurchases will be funded by cash flows from operations.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nFinancial position in current market. As of December 31, 2019, we had $255.0 million of cash and a total of $303.8 million available under our revolving credit facility. We currently believe that our cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months, including for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital investments and stock repurchases.\nGuarantee agreements. Under the 2019 ABL Facility $31.8 million of letters of credit were outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nCustomer receivables. In line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. The majority of our trade receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity. The table below contains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands of Dollars)\nContractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023-2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2025+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portion(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-method investment(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal contingency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Long-term debt represents our obligations under our 2018 Term Loan Facility, exclusive of interest payments.

Interest rates used for variable rate debt are based on the prevailing current London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). \n (3) Finance lease obligations primarily consist of obligations on our finance leases of light weight vehicles with ARI Financial Services Inc. and Enterprise FM Trust and includes interest payments. \n (4) Operating lease obligations are related to our real estate, rail cars, and light duty vehicles. \n (5) Purchase commitments primarily relate to our agreements with vendors for sand purchases and deposits on equipment. The purchase commitments to sand suppliers represent our annual obligations to purchase a minimum amount of sand from vendors. If the minimum purchase requirement is not met, the shortfall at the end of the year is settled in cash or, in some cases, carried forward to the next year. \n (6) Equity-method investment is related to our research and development commitments with our equity-method investee.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further details. .\nPrincipal Debt Agreements\n2019 ABL Facility\nOrigination. On the October 31, 2019, we, and certain of our other subsidiaries as additional borrowers and guarantors, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the 2019 ABL Facility\u201d) to the original Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2017, as amended December 22, 2017 (the 2017 ABL Facility\u201d).\nStructure. Our 2019 ABL Facility provides for a $450.0 million revolving credit facility (with a $100.0 million subfacility for letters of credit), subject to a borrowing base in accordance with the terms agreed between us and the lenders. In addition, subject to approval by the applicable lenders and other customary conditions, the 2019 ABL Facility allows for an additional increase in commitments of up to $200.0 million. The 2019 ABL Facility is subject to customary fees, guarantees of subsidiaries, restrictions and covenants, including certain restricted payments.\nMaturity. The loans arising under the initial commitments under the 2019 ABL Facility mature on October 31, 2024. The loans arising under any tranche of extended loans or additional commitments mature as specified in the applicable extension amendment or increase joinder, respectively.\nInterest. Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 ABL Facility, amounts outstanding under the 2019 ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group Holdings, LLC's option, (a) the base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 1.00%, (y) if the\naverage excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 0.75% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 0.50%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 2.00%, (y) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 1.75% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 1.50%, to a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group Holdings, LLC's option, (a) the base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 0.75%, (y) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 0.50% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 0.25%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if the average excess availability is less than 33%, 1.75%, (y) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 33% but less than 66%, 1.50% or (z) if the average excess availability is greater than or equal to 66%, 1.25%.\nFinancial Covenants. The 2019 ABL Facility requires that, under certain circumstances, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio not be lower than 1.0:1.0 as of the last day of the most recently completed four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements were required to have been delivered, including if excess availability (or liquidity if no loan or letter of credit, other than any letter of credit that has been cash collateralized, is outstanding) is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the loan cap and (ii) $30.0 million at any time. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\n2018 Term Loan Facility\nOn May 25, 2018, Keane Group and the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors (as defined below) entered into the 2018 Term Loan Facility with each lender from time to time party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The proceeds of the 2018 Term Loan Facility were used to refinance Keane Group's then-existing term loan facility and to repay related fees and expenses, with the excess proceeds to fund general corporate purposes.\nStructure. The 2018 Term Loan Facility provides for a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the loans incurred under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the 2018 Term Loans\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $337.6 million principal amount of 2018 Term Loans outstanding. In addition, subject to certain customary conditions, the 2018 Term Loan Facility allows for additional incremental term loans to be incurred thereunder in an amount equal to the sum of (a) $200.0 million plus the aggregate principal amount of voluntary prepayments of 2018 Term Loans made on or prior to the date of determination (less amounts incurred in reliance on the capacity described in this subclause (a)), plus (b) an unlimited amount, subject to, (x) in the case of debt secured on a pari passu basis with the 2018 Term Loans, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a first lien net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 2.00:1.00, (y) in the case of debt secured on a junior basis with the 2018 Term Loans, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a secured net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 3.00:1.00 and (z) in the case of unsecured debt, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a total net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 3.50:1.00.\nMaturity. May 25, 2025 or, if earlier, the stated maturity date of any other term loans or term commitments.\nAmortization. The 2018 Term Loans amortize in quarterly installments equal to 1.00% per annum of the aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding.\nInterest. The 2018 Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group's option, (a) the base rate plus 2.75%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 3.75%, subject to, on and after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, a pricing grid with three 0.25% per annum step-ups and one 0.25% per annum step-down determined based on total net leverage for the relevant period. Following a payment event of default, the 2018 Term Loans bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such 2018 Term Loans at such time plus an additional 2.00% per annum during the continuance of such event of default.\nPrepayments. The 2018 Term Loan Facility is required to be prepaid with: (a) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and other dispositions, subject to the terms of an intercreditor\nagreement between the agent for the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the agent for the 2019 ABL Facility and certain exceptions; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of debt incurrences or issuances (other than debt incurrences permitted under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, which exclusion is not applicable to permitted refinancing debt) and (c) 50% (subject to step-downs to 25% and 0%, upon and during achievement of certain total net leverage ratios) of excess cash flow in excess of a certain amount, minus certain voluntary prepayments made under the 2018 Term Loan Facility or other debt secured on a pari passu basis with the 2018 Term Loans and voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2019 ABL Facility to the extent the commitments under the 2019 ABL Facility are permanently reduced by such prepayments.\nGuarantees. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by the Company, Keane Frac, LP, KS Drilling, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco I, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC, and Keane Frac GP, LLC, and each subsidiary of the Company that will be required to execute and deliver a facility guaranty in the future pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors\u201d).\nSecurity. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan Facility are secured by (a) a first-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the assets of Keane Group and the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors to the extent not constituting ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as defined below) and (b) a second-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the accounts receivable, inventory, and frac iron equipment, and certain other assets and property related to the foregoing including certain chattel paper, investment property, documents, letter of credit rights, payment intangibles, general intangibles, commercial tort claims, books and records and supporting obligations of the borrowers and guarantors under the 2019 ABL Facility (the ABL Facility Priority Collateral\u201d).\nFees. Certain customary fees are payable to the lenders and the agents under the 2018 Term Loan Facility.\nRestricted Payment Covenant. The 2018 Term Loan Facility includes a covenant restricting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions. The 2018 Term Loan Facility provides that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may, among things, make cash dividends and other restricted payments in an aggregate amount during the life of the facility not to exceed (a) $100.0 million, plus (b) the amount of net proceeds received by Keane Group from the funding of the 2018 Term Loans in excess of the of such net proceeds required to finance the refinancing of the pre-existing term loan facility and pay fees and expenses related thereto and to the entry into the 2018 Term Loan Facility, plus (c) an unlimited amount so long as, after giving effect to such restricted payment, the total net leverage ratio would not exceed 2.00:1.00. In addition, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may make restricted payments utilizing the Cumulative Credit (as defined below), subject to certain conditions including, if any portion of the Cumulative Credit utilized is comprised of amounts under clause (b) of the definition thereof below, the pro forma total net leverage ratio being no greater than 2.50:1.00.\nCumulative Credit\u201d, generally, is defined as an amount equal to (a) $25.0 million, (b) 50% of consolidated net income of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries on a cumulative basis from April 1, 2018 (which cumulative amount shall not be less than zero), plus (c) other customary additions, and reduced by the amount of Cumulative Credit used prior to such time (whether for restricted payments, junior debt payments or investments).\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants. The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants (in each case, subject to customary exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility). The 2018 Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\nEvents of Default. The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions or special purpose entities.\nRelated Party Transactions\nOur board of directors has adopted a written policy and procedures (the Related Party Policy\u201d) for the review, approval and ratification of the related party transactions by the independent members of the audit and risk committee of our board of directors. For purposes of the Related Party Policy, a Related Party Transaction\u201d is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including the incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness or the guarantee of indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be reasonably expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (2) the company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any Related Party (as defined herein) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. All Related Party Transactions will be reviewed in accordance with the standards set forth in the Related Party Policy after full disclosure of the Related Party's interests in the transaction.\nThe Related Party Policy defines Related Party\u201d as any person who is, or, at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, was (1) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (2) a person with greater than five percent (5%) beneficial interest in the Company, (3) an immediate family member of any of the individuals or entities identified in (1) or (2) of this paragraph, and (4) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing individuals or entities is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person or entity has a five percent (5%) or greater beneficial interest. Immediate family members includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's home, other than a tenant or employee.\nTransaction prices with our related parties are commensurate with transaction prices in arms-length transactions. For further details about our transactions with Related Parties, see Note (19) Related Party Transactions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion on the impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted to our consolidated and combined financial statements, see Note (23) New Accounting Pronouncements of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nA critical accounting estimate is one that requires a high level of subjective judgment by management and has a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nBusiness combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of businesses we acquire to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows, multi-period excess earning or income-based-relief-from-royalty methods. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventories, identifiable long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets, as well as any contingent consideration or earn-out provisions that provide for additional consideration to be paid to the seller if certain future conditions are met. These estimates are reviewed during the 12-month measurement period and adjusted based on actual results. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our recently completed merger and acquisition during 2019 and 2017, respectively.\nAsset acquisitions\nAsset acquisitions are measured based on their cost to us, including transaction costs incurred by us. An asset acquisition's cost or the consideration transferred by us is assumed to be equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired. If the consideration transferred is cash, measurement is based on the amount of cash we paid to the seller, as well as transaction costs incurred by us. Consideration given in the form of nonmonetary assets, liabilities incurred or equity interests issued is measured based on either the cost to us or the fair value of the assets or net assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. The cost of an asset acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated relative fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventories, identifiable long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. See Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for our asset acquisition from RSI in 2018.\nLegal and environmental contingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations, claims and actions, as is typical of the industry. These claims include, but are not limited to, contract claims, environmental claims, employment related claims, claims alleging injury or claims related to operational issues. Our assessment of the likely outcome of litigation matters is based on our judgment of a number of factors, including experience with similar matters, past history, precedents, relevant financial information and other evidence and facts specific to the matter. We accrue for contingencies when the occurrence of a material loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, based on our best estimate of the expected liability. The estimate of probable costs related to a contingency is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. The accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. Differences between the actual settlement costs, final judgments or fines from our estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. See Note (18) Commitments and Contingencies of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our legal, environmental and other regulatory contingencies.\nValuation of long-lived assets, indefinite-lived assets and goodwill\nWe assess our long-lived assets, such as definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually, as of October 31, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or the indefinite-lived assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment charge that reduces our earnings.\nWe perform our qualitative assessments of the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors relevant to each of our reporting segments, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value\ncalculations are based on subjective, judgmental assessments of projected revenue growth, fleet count, utilization, gross margin rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Many of these judgments are driven by crude oil prices. If the crude oil market declines and remains at low levels for a sustained period of time, we would expect to perform our impairment assessments more frequently and could record impairment charges.\nSee Note (2)(h) Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and (2)(i) Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on our impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, indefinite-lived assets and goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are accounted for based upon the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carry-forwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. We estimate our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time, while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year-end. Our effective tax rates will vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income or losses, fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In addition to our historical financial results, we consider forecasted market growth, earnings and taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. We establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.\nWe calculate our income tax liability based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of our tax liabilities. These differences are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to, (1) the requirement to pay a one-time transition tax on all undistributed earnings of\nforeign subsidiaries; (2) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (3) eliminating the alternative minimum tax; (4) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (5) changing rules related to use and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We evaluated the provisions of the Tax Act and determined only the reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% would have an impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements as of December 31, 2017. Accordingly, we recorded a provision to income taxes for our assessment of the tax impact of the Tax Act on ending deferred tax assets and liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance. The effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are not expected to have an adverse impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements. We will continue to assess the impact of other aspects of U.S. tax reform on our tax positions and our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nSee Note (17) Income Taxes of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLeases\nPer ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" lessees can classify leases as finance leases or operating leases, while lessors can classify leases as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases. All leases, with the exception of short-term leases, are capitalized on the balance sheet by recording a lease liability, which represents our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, along with a corresponding right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset being leased. For leases in which we are the lessee, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability, as in most cases we do not know the lessor's implicit rate in the lease. Establishing our lease obligations on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets require judgmental assessments of the term lengths of each and the interest rate yield curve that best represents the collateralized incremental borrowing rate to apply to each lease. We engage third-party specialists to assist us in determining the collateralized incremental borrowing rate yield curve. Errors in determining the lease term lengths and/or selecting the best representative collateralized incremental borrowing rate can have a material adverse effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For further details about our leases, see Note (16) Leases of Part II, \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor discussion on the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted, see Note (23) New Accounting Pronouncements of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information related to forward looking statements or information related to the basis of presentation and comparability of financial information, please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information\u201d and Basis of Presentation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\u201d, both of which immediately follow the table of contents of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nNexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. is an industry-leading U.S. land oilfield focused service company, with a diverse set of well completion and production services across a variety of active and demanding basins. We have a history of growth through acquisition, including (i) our 2017 acquisition of RockPile, a multi-basin provider of integrated well completion services in the U.S. whose primary service offerings included hydraulic fracturing, wireline perforation and workover rigs, and (ii) our 2018 asset acquisition from RSI to acquire approximately 90,000 hydraulic horsepower and related support equipment. Our most recent strategic transaction was the October 31, 2019, merger transaction with C&J Energy Services, Inc. ( C&J Merger\u201d), a publicly traded Delaware corporation. This history impacts the comparability of our operational results from year to year. See Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report for an overview of our history, including additional information on the acquisitions noted above, including the C&J Merger, our 2017 IPO, predecessor, and business environment. Additional information on these transactions can be found in Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d\nIndustry Overview\nWe provide our services in several of the most active basins in the United States, including the Permian, the Marcellus Shale/Utica, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken/Rockies. These regions are expected to account for approximately 73% of all new horizontal wells anticipated to be drilled through 2021. In addition, the high density of our operations in the basins in which we are most active provides us the opportunity to leverage our fixed costs and to quickly respond with what we believe are highly efficient, integrated solutions that are best suited to address customer requirements.\nIn particular, we are one of the largest providers of completion services in the Permian Basin, the most prolific and cost-competitive oil and natural gas basin in the United States. The Permian and the Marcellus Shale/Utica Basins are expected to account for 56% of total active rigs in the United States through 2022. These basins have experienced a recovery in activity since the spring of 2016, with an 156% increase in rig count from their combined second quarter of 2016 low of 185 to 475 as of December 31, 2019. Our financial performance is significantly affected by rig and well count in North America, as well as oil and natural gas prices, which are summarized in the tables below.\nActivity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas demand. Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices, global oil supply, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling activity.\nWhile it is too early to determine the impact, the recent actions taken by OPEC are expected to have a material negative impact on crude oil prices. Our customers' cash flows, in most instances, depend upon the revenue they generate from the sale of oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets. We are closely monitoring the situation including potential activity responses by our E&P customers.\nThe following table shows the average historical oil and natural gas prices for WTI and Henry Hub natural gas:\n\nThe historical average U.S. rig counts based on the weekly Baker Hughes Incorporated rig count information were as follows:\n\n\nAs of February 2020, global liquids demand is expected to average 101.7 million barrels per day in 2020. The EIA anticipates continued growth in the long-term U.S. domestic demand for natural gas, supported by various factors, including (i) increased likelihood of favorable regulatory and legislative initiatives, (ii) increased acceptance of natural gas as a clean and abundant domestic fuel source and (iii) the emergence of low-cost natural gas shale developments. As of February 2020, natural gas demand in the United States is expected to average 86.24 billion cubic feet per day in 2020.\nOperating Approach & Strategy\nWe believe our integrated approach and proven capabilities enable us to deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments, higher pressure rates and proppant intensity and multiple fracturing stages in challenging high-pressure formations. In addition, our technical team and our three innovation centers, provide us with the ability to supplement our service offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address customers' completion requirements and unique challenges.\nOur revenues and profits are generated by providing services and equipment to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells. Our results of operations in our core service lines are driven primarily by five interrelated, fluctuating variables: (1) the drilling, completion and production activities of our customers, which is primarily driven by oil and natural gas prices and directly affects the demand for our services; (2) the price we are able to charge for our services and equipment, which is primarily driven by the level of demand for our services and the supply of equipment capacity in the market; (3) the cost of materials, supplies and labor involved in providing our services, and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers; (4) our activity, or deployed equipment utilization\u201d levels; and (5) the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution.\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high utilization levels of deployed equipment to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the quality and efficiency of our service execution and aligning with customers who recognize the value that we provide through service quality and efficiency gains are central to our efforts to support equipment utilization and grow our business.\nHowever, equipment utilization cannot be relied on as wholly indicative of our financial or operating performance due to variations in revenue and profitability from job to job, the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle.\nHistorically, our utilization levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore spending by our customers, which is heavily driven by the price of oil and natural gas. Generally, as capital spending by our customers increases, drilling, completion and production activity also increases, resulting in increased demand for our services, and therefore more days or hours worked (as the case may be). Conversely, when drilling, completion and production activity levels decline due to lower spending by our customers, we generally provide fewer services, which results in fewer days or hours worked (as the case may be). Additionally, during periods of decreased spending by our customers, we may be required to discount our rates or provide other pricing concessions to remain competitive and support deployed equipment utilization, which negatively impacts our revenue and operating margins. During periods of pricing weakness for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, and our ability to achieve any cost reductions from our suppliers typically lags behind the decline in pricing for our services, which could further adversely affect our results. Furthermore, when demand for our services increases following a period of low demand, our ability to capitalize on such increased demand may be delayed while we reengage and redeploy equipment and crews that have been idled during a downturn. The mix of customers that we are working for, as well as limited periods of exposure to the spot market, also impacts our deployed equipment utilization.\nOur Reportable Segments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were organized into three reportable segments:\n \u2022 Completion Services, which consists of the following businesses and services lines: (1) hydraulic fracturing; (2) wireline and pumpdown services; and (3) completion support services, which includes our innovation centers and activities. \n \u2022 Well Construction and Intervention Services, which consists of the following businesses and service lines: (1) cementing services and (2) coiled tubing services. \n \u2022 Well Support Services, which consists of the following businesses and service lines: (1) rig services; (2) fluids management; and (3) other special well site services.  Completion Services\nThe core services provided through our Completion Services segment are hydraulic fracturing, wireline and pumpdown services. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 45 hydraulic fracturing fleets, 118 wireline trucks and 80 pumpdown units capable of being deployed. Our completion support services are focused on supporting the efficiency, reliability and quality of our operations. Our Innovation Centers provide in-house manufacturing capabilities that help to reduce operating cost and enable us to offer more technologically advanced and efficiency focused completion services, which we believe is a competitive differentiator. For example, through our Innovation Centers we manufacture the data control instruments used in our fracturing operations and the perforating guns and addressable switches used in our wireline operations; these products are also available for sale to third-parties. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our fracturing business.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nThe core services provided through our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment are cementing and coiled tubing services. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our cementing business. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 25 coiled tubing units and 101 cementing units capable of being deployed.\nWell Support Services\nOur Well Support Services segment was divested in a transaction that closed on March 9, 2020. It focused on post-completion activities at the well site, including rig services, such as workover and plug and abandonment, fluids management services, and other specialty well site services. Since early 2017, in response to the highly competitive landscape and reflecting our returns-focused strategy, we had focused on operational rightsizing measures to better align these businesses with current market conditions. This strategy resulted in closing facilities and idling unproductive equipment. For example, we either sold or shut down numerous businesses or asset packages, which included the divestiture of the majority of our fluids management assets in both West and South Texas in the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 276 workover rigs and 348 fluids management trucks capable of being deployed. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our rig services business, and we consider rig services and fluids management to be the primary businesses within this segment.\nHow we calculate utilization for each segment\nOur management team monitors asset utilization, among other factors, for purposes of assessing our overall activity levels and customer demand. For our Completion Services segment, asset utilization levels for our own fleets is defined as the ratio of the average number of deployed fleets to the number of total fleets for a given time period. We define active fleets as fleets available for deployment; we consider one of our fleets deployed if the fleet has been put in service at least one day during the period for which we calculate utilization; and we define fully-\nutilized fleets per month as fleets that were deployed and working with our customers for a significant portion of a given month. As a result, as additional fleets are incrementally deployed, our utilization rate increases. We define industry utilization of fracturing assets as the ratio of the total industry demand of hydraulic horsepower to the total available capacity of hydraulic horsepower, in each case as reported by an independent industry source. Our method for calculating the utilization rate for our own fracturing fleets or the industry may differ from the method used by other companies or industry sources which could, for example, be based off a ratio of the total number of days a fleet is put in service to the total number of days in the relevant period. We believe that our measures of utilization, based on the number of deployed fleets, provide an accurate representation of existing, available capacity for additional revenue generating activity.\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, we measure our asset utilization levels for our cementing business primarily by the total number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month. In our coiled tubing business, we measure certain asset utilization levels by the hour to better understand measures between daylight and 24-hour operations. Both the financial and operating performance of our coiled tubing and cement units can vary in revenue and profitability from job to job depending on the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed.\nIn our Well Support Services segment, we measured asset utilization levels primarily by the number of hours our assets work on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month.\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the safety, quality and efficiency of our service execution and our alignment with customers who recognize the value that we provide are central to our efforts to support utilization and grow our business. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle. For additional information about factors impacting our business and results of operations, please see Industry Trends and Outlook\u201d in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended the year ended December 31, 2018. Our financial results for 2019 include the financial and operating results of the businesses acquired in the C&J Merger for the partial period beginning November 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.\nA comparison of our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in the \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed on February 27, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\nRevenue. Total revenue is comprised of revenue from our Completion Services, Well Construction and Intervention Services and Well Support Services segments. Revenue in 2019 decreased by $315.5 million, or 15%, to $1.8 billion from $2.1 billion in 2018. The net decline was driven primarily by a decrease in rig count and fleet utilization, combined with pricing pressures from macroeconomic market conditions. This decrease in utilization was primarily from our customers shifting their focus to capital discipline through reduced activity levels and pricing. Despite pricing pressures, we retained our core customer base by aligning with high quality and efficient customers under dedicated agreements. This change in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue decreased by $391.0 million, or 19%, to $1.7 billion in 2019 from $2.1 billion in 2018. The segment revenue decline was driven by lower fleet utilization and decreased activity levels year over year, in addition to continued pricing pressures from market conditions. This was offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the C&J Merger.\nWell Construction and Intervention: Well Construction and Intervention Services segment revenue increased by $27.0 million, or 75%, to $63.0 million in 2019 from $36.1 million in 2018. This increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the C&J Merger.\nWell Support Services: Well Support Services segment revenue was $48.6 million in 2019 with no comparison period in 2018. This increase in revenue was solely attributable to the acquisition of the segment through the C&J Merger.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2019 decreased by $256.6 million, or 15%, to $1.4 billion from $1.7 billion in 2018. This change was driven by several factors including lower overall activity and fleet utilization, as discussed above under Revenue, in addition to the impact of cost optimization from cost management efforts and input cost deflation.\nEquipment Utilization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $33.0 million, or 13%, to $292.2 million in 2019 from $259.1 million in 2018. The change in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to additional equipment purchases from the RSI Acquisition in late 2018, maintenance spend for fleet readiness, and other equipment used for continuing to enhance safety and efficiency through our multi-faceted approach of surface, digital and downhole technologies. Loss on disposal of assets in 2019 decreased by $0.6 million, to a loss of $4.5 million in 2019 from a loss of $5.0 million in 2018. The decrease in loss on disposal of assets is primarily related to a larger number of early failures of major components in 2018 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher activity and use of equipment in 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $9.9 million, or 9%, to $123.7 million in 2019 from $113.8 million in 2018. This change in SG&A was primarily related to non-cash compensation expense of $19.4 million and litigation contingencies of $3.8 million.\nMerger and integration expense. Merger and integration expense increased by $68.3 million to $68.7 million in 2019 from $0.4 million in 2018. The $68.7 million in merger and integration expense in 2019 was due to the C&J Merger, which consisted primarily of professional services, severance costs, and facility consolidation. The $0.4 million in 2018 is related to transaction cost associated with the RSI Acquisition.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, in 2019 increased by $1.4 million, or 150%, to income of $0.5 million in 2019 from expense of $0.9 million in 2018. In 2018, other expense, net was primarily due to a $13.2 million adjustment to our Rockpile CVR liability, $2.7 million loss on foreign currency related to the wind-down of the Canadian entity, offset by a $14.9 million gain on the insurance proceeds received for losses resulting from the July 1, 2018 accidental fire.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $11.6 million, or 35%, to $21.9 million in 2019 from $33.5 million in 2018. This change was primarily attributable to the $7.6 million write-offs of deferred financing costs in 2018, in connection with the debt extinguishment of our 2017 Term Loan Facility.\nEffective tax rate. Upon consummation of the IPO, the Company became a corporation subject to federal income taxes. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2019 was (0.96)%, as compared to 6.71% in 2018. For 2019, the effective rate is primarily made up of state taxes and a tax benefit derived from the current period operating loss offset by a valuation allowance. For 2018, the effective rate was primarily made up of state taxes and tax benefits derived from the current period operating income offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of market conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate as it is not more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets. The remaining tax impact not offset by a valuation allowance is related to indefinite-lived assets.\nIndustry Drivers of 2019 Operations\nBetween January and April 2019, the increase in oil prices incentivized many of our customers to significantly increase activity levels early in 2019. This resulted in E&P capital budget exhaustion and early\nachievement of E&P production targets, and in combination with normal year-end seasonality, resulted in softening demand for completions services by the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, lackluster oil and gas prices in 2019 resulted in the E&P budgeting process to be more muted, causing many E&P companies to delay activity start-up into early 2020. Furthermore, the current market oversupply of fracturing equipment created a competitive pricing environment at year-end 2019 during E&P budgeting season, which resulted in pricing pressure in order win new work or extend existing dedicated agreements that were up for renewal. With that said, most of our customers see value in a long-term partnership with us, and as a result, traded some price concessions by us for extended terms or additional work scope.\nWe are committed to continuing to manage our business in line with demand for our services and make adjustments as necessary to effectively respond to changes in market conditions, customer activity levels, pricing for our services and equipment, and utilization of our deployed equipment and personnel. Our response to the industry's persistent uncertainty is to maintain sufficient liquidity, preserve our conservative capital structure and closely monitor our discretionary spending. We take a measured approach to asset deployment, balancing our view of current and expected customer activity levels with a focus on generating positive returns for our shareholders. Our priorities remain to drive revenue by maximizing deployed equipment utilization, to improve margins through cost controls, to protect and grow our market share by focusing on the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution, and to ensure that we are strategically positioned to capitalize on constructive market dynamics.\nLooking Ahead to 2020\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Although many factors contributing to these risks are beyond our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable. In addition, while we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Please read the factors described in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information about the known material risks that we face.\nFiscal 2020 Objectives\nWith recent commodity price volatility, we intend to closely monitor the market and will adjust our approach as the situation develops. At this time, in 2020, our principal business objective continues to be growing our business and safely providing best-in-class services in all of our operating segments, while delivering shareholder value and maintaining a disciplined capital deployment strategy. We expect to achieve our objective through:\n \u2022 partnering and growing with well-capitalized customers under dedicated agreements who focus their efforts on safety, high-efficiency completions, continuous improvement and innovation; \n \u2022 allocating our assets to maximize utilization and returns, including diversification of geographies and commodities; \n \u2022 maximizing profitability of fully-utilized fleets through leading-edge pricing and efficiencies; \n \u2022 investing in technology to further drive efficiencies, enable differentiation of service offerings, and reduce our overall cost structure; \n \u2022 leveraging our flexible and scalable logistics infrastructure to provide assurance of supply at lowest landed cost; \n \u2022 leveraging our platform to identify, retain and promote talent to sustain growth and support operational and commercial excellence; maintaining agreements with our existing strategic suppliers and identify and develop relationships with additional strategic suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and optimize efficiency; \n \u2022 maintaining our conservative and flexible capital position, supporting continued growth and maintenance of active equipment; \n \u2022 gaining scale, enhancing our service offering, and capturing targeted cost synergies from the C&J Merger; and \n \u2022 returning capital to shareholders in a disciplined fashion.  Completion Services\nIn our Completion Services segment, our strategy remains focused on deploying our market-ready fracturing fleets and bundling more of our wireline and pumpdown units with our deployed fracturing fleets and on a stand-alone basis. We are focused on increasing our dedicated fracturing fleet count with efficient customers that allow us to achieve high equipment utilization, which should result in improved financial performance. Additionally, we are focused on bundling more of our wireline and pumpdown units with our fracturing fleets to increase operational efficiencies and profitability. With that said, current market conditions remain challenging, and our primary focus remains to lower our overall cost structure by aligning with efficient, dedicated customers with deep inventories of work and proven track records of efficient operations, many of which we have created long-term relationships with over the past several years.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, our strategy remains focused on deploying our market-ready cementing equipment and two newbuild coiled tubing units that we will take delivery of in the first quarter of 2020. In our cementing business, even though market conditions remain challenged due to customers releasing drilling rigs and declining E&P capital spending in 2020, we remain focused on providing high-quality, timely service and deploying more of our stacked units with efficient customers with deep inventories of work in our core operating basins. We will stay focused on controlling costs, improving market share with an efficient customer base that plan to maintain stable drilling rig counts in 2020. In our coiled tubing business, we are focused on deploying two newbuild, large-diameter units into our core operating basins and increasing market share with large, efficient customers with deep inventories of completion-oriented work that will keep our new units highly utilized.\nWell Support Services\nWe divested our Well Support Services segment on March 9, 2020, for total consideration of $93.7 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity represents a company's ability to adjust its future cash flows to meet needs and opportunities, both expected and unexpected.\n\n\nSignificant sources and uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2019\nSources of cash:\n \u2022 Operating activities: \n - Net cash generated by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $305.5 million was a result of our thoroughness in receiving collections from our customers and controlling costs.

We used a portion of our IPO proceeds and the proceeds of the 2017 Term Loan Facility to repay our 2016 Term Loan Facility and Senior Secured Notes.  Future sources and use of cash\nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically included, and we have funded our capital expenditures with, cash flows from operations, proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under debt facilities. Our ability to generate future cash flows is subject to a number of variables, many of which are outside of our control, including the drilling, completion and production activity by our customers, which is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d for additional discussion of certain factors that impact our results and the market challenges within our industry.\nOur primary uses of cash are for operating costs, capital expenditures, debt service and our stock repurchase program.\nCapital expenditures for 2020 are projected to be primarily related to maintenance capital spend to support our existing active fleets, wireline trucks, coil units, and cementing units.\nDebt service for the year ended December 31, 2020 is projected to be $30.9 million, of which $3.5 million is related to capital leases. We anticipate our debt service will be funded by cash flows from operations.\nOn December 11, 2019, the Company announced the board of directors approved a new $100 million capital return program, which includes a $50 million stock repurchase program through December 2020. No share repurchases were made under the share repurchase program in 2019. Although our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We anticipate any share repurchases will be funded by cash flows from operations.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nFinancial position in current market. As of December 31, 2019, we had $255.0 million of cash and a total of $303.8 million available under our revolving credit facility. We currently believe that our cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months, including for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital investments and stock repurchases.\nGuarantee agreements. Under the 2019 ABL Facility $31.8 million of letters of credit were outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nCustomer receivables. In line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. The majority of our trade receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity. The table below contains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019.\n\n (1) Long-term debt represents our obligations under our 2018 Term Loan Facility, exclusive of interest payments. In addition, these amounts exclude $7.1 million of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with our 2018 Term Loan Facility. \n (2) Estimated interest payments are based on debt balances outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and include interest related to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. Interest rates used for variable rate debt are based on the prevailing current London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). \n (3) Finance lease obligations primarily consist of obligations on our finance leases of light weight vehicles with ARI Financial Services Inc. and Enterprise FM Trust and includes interest payments. \n (4) Operating lease obligations are related to our real estate, rail cars, and light duty vehicles. \n (5) Purchase commitments primarily relate to our agreements with vendors for sand purchases and deposits on equipment. The purchase commitments to sand suppliers represent our annual obligations to purchase a minimum amount of sand from vendors. If the minimum purchase requirement is not met, the shortfall at the end of the year is settled in cash or, in some cases, carried forward to the next year. \n (6) Equity-method investment is related to our research and development commitments with our equity-method investee. See Notes (18) Commitments and Contingencies and (19) Related Party Transactions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further details. .\nPrincipal Debt Agreements\n2019 ABL Facility\nOrigination. On the October 31, 2019, we, and certain of our other subsidiaries as additional borrowers and guarantors, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the 2019 ABL Facility\u201d) to the original Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2017, as amended December 22, 2017 (the 2017 ABL Facility\u201d).\nStructure. Our 2019 ABL Facility provides for a $450.0 million revolving credit facility (with a $100.0 million subfacility for letters of credit), subject to a borrowing base in accordance with the terms agreed between us and the lenders. In addition, subject to approval by the applicable lenders and other customary conditions, the 2019 ABL Facility allows for an additional increase in commitments of up to $200.0 million.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\n2018 Term Loan Facility\nOn May 25, 2018, Keane Group and the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors (as defined below) entered into the 2018 Term Loan Facility with each lender from time to time party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The proceeds of the 2018 Term Loan Facility were used to refinance Keane Group's then-existing term loan facility and to repay related fees and expenses, with the excess proceeds to fund general corporate purposes.\nStructure. The 2018 Term Loan Facility provides for a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the loans incurred under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the 2018 Term Loans\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $337.6 million principal amount of 2018 Term Loans outstanding. In addition, subject to certain customary conditions, the 2018 Term Loan Facility allows for additional incremental term loans to be incurred thereunder in an amount equal to the sum of (a) $200.0 million plus the aggregate principal amount of voluntary prepayments of 2018 Term Loans made on or prior to the date of determination (less amounts incurred in reliance on the capacity described in this subclause (a)), plus (b) an unlimited amount, subject to, (x) in the case of debt secured on a pari passu basis with the 2018 Term Loans, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a first lien net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 2.00:1.00, (y) in the case of debt secured on a junior basis with the 2018 Term Loans, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a secured net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 3.00:1.00 and (z) in the case of unsecured debt, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, a total net leverage ratio being less than or equal to 3.50:1.00.\nMaturity. May 25, 2025 or, if earlier, the stated maturity date of any other term loans or term commitments.\nAmortization. The 2018 Term Loans amortize in quarterly installments equal to 1.00% per annum of the aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding.\nInterest. The 2018 Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group's option, (a) the base rate plus 2.75%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 3.75%, subject to, on and after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, a pricing grid with three 0.25% per annum step-ups and one 0.25% per annum step-down determined based on total net leverage for the relevant period. Following a payment event of default, the 2018 Term Loans bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such 2018 Term Loans at such time plus an additional 2.00% per annum during the continuance of such event of default.\nPrepayments. The 2018 Term Loan Facility is required to be prepaid with: (a) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and other dispositions, subject to the terms of an intercreditor\nagreement between the agent for the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the agent for the 2019 ABL Facility and certain exceptions; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of debt incurrences or issuances (other than debt incurrences permitted under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, which exclusion is not applicable to permitted refinancing debt) and (c) 50% (subject to step-downs to 25% and 0%, upon and during achievement of certain total net leverage ratios) of excess cash flow in excess of a certain amount, minus certain voluntary prepayments made under the 2018 Term Loan Facility or other debt secured on a pari passu basis with the 2018 Term Loans and voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2019 ABL Facility to the extent the commitments under the 2019 ABL Facility are permanently reduced by such prepayments.\nGuarantees. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by the Company, Keane Frac, LP, KS Drilling, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco I, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC, and Keane Frac GP, LLC, and each subsidiary of the Company that will be required to execute and deliver a facility guaranty in the future pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors\u201d).\nSecurity. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan Facility are secured by (a) a first-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the assets of Keane Group and the 2018 Term Loan Guarantors to the extent not constituting ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as defined below) and (b) a second-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the accounts receivable, inventory, and frac iron equipment, and certain other assets and property related to the foregoing including certain chattel paper, investment property, documents, letter of credit rights, payment intangibles, general intangibles, commercial tort claims, books and records and supporting obligations of the borrowers and guarantors under the 2019 ABL Facility (the ABL Facility Priority Collateral\u201d).\nFees. Certain customary fees are payable to the lenders and the agents under the 2018 Term Loan Facility.\nRestricted Payment Covenant. The 2018 Term Loan Facility includes a covenant restricting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions. The 2018 Term Loan Facility provides that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may, among things, make cash dividends and other restricted payments in an aggregate amount during the life of the facility not to exceed (a) $100.0 million, plus (b) the amount of net proceeds received by Keane Group from the funding of the 2018 Term Loans in excess of the of such net proceeds required to finance the refinancing of the pre-existing term loan facility and pay fees and expenses related thereto and to the entry into the 2018 Term Loan Facility, plus (c) an unlimited amount so long as, after giving effect to such restricted payment, the total net leverage ratio would not exceed 2.00:1.00. In addition, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may make restricted payments utilizing the Cumulative Credit (as defined below), subject to certain conditions including, if any portion of the Cumulative Credit utilized is comprised of amounts under clause (b) of the definition thereof below, the pro forma total net leverage ratio being no greater than 2.50:1.00.\nCumulative Credit\u201d, generally, is defined as an amount equal to (a) $25.0 million, (b) 50% of consolidated net income of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries on a cumulative basis from April 1, 2018 (which cumulative amount shall not be less than zero), plus (c) other customary additions, and reduced by the amount of Cumulative Credit used prior to such time (whether for restricted payments, junior debt payments or investments).\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants. The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants (in each case, subject to customary exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility). The 2018 Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\nEvents of Default. The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods as set forth in the definitive documentation for the 2018 Term Loan Facility).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions or special purpose entities.\nRelated Party Transactions\nOur board of directors has adopted a written policy and procedures (the Related Party Policy\u201d) for the review, approval and ratification of the related party transactions by the independent members of the audit and risk committee of our board of directors. For purposes of the Related Party Policy, a Related Party Transaction\u201d is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including the incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness or the guarantee of indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be reasonably expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (2) the company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any Related Party (as defined herein) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. All Related Party Transactions will be reviewed in accordance with the standards set forth in the Related Party Policy after full disclosure of the Related Party's interests in the transaction.\nThe Related Party Policy defines Related Party\u201d as any person who is, or, at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, was (1) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (2) a person with greater than five percent (5%) beneficial interest in the Company, (3) an immediate family member of any of the individuals or entities identified in (1) or (2) of this paragraph, and (4) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing individuals or entities is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person or entity has a five percent (5%) or greater beneficial interest. Immediate family members includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's home, other than a tenant or employee.\nTransaction prices with our related parties are commensurate with transaction prices in arms-length transactions. For further details about our transactions with Related Parties, see Note (19) Related Party Transactions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion on the impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted to our consolidated and combined financial statements, see Note (23) New Accounting Pronouncements of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nA critical accounting estimate is one that requires a high level of subjective judgment by management and has a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nBusiness combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of businesses we acquire to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows, multi-period excess earning or income-based-relief-from-royalty methods. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventories, identifiable long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets, as well as any contingent consideration or earn-out provisions that provide for additional consideration to be paid to the seller if certain future conditions are met. These estimates are reviewed during the 12-month measurement period and adjusted based on actual results. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our recently completed merger and acquisition during 2019 and 2017, respectively.\nAsset acquisitions\nAsset acquisitions are measured based on their cost to us, including transaction costs incurred by us. An asset acquisition's cost or the consideration transferred by us is assumed to be equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired. If the consideration transferred is cash, measurement is based on the amount of cash we paid to the seller, as well as transaction costs incurred by us. Consideration given in the form of nonmonetary assets, liabilities incurred or equity interests issued is measured based on either the cost to us or the fair value of the assets or net assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. The cost of an asset acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated relative fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventories, identifiable long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. See Note (3) Mergers and Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for our asset acquisition from RSI in 2018.\nLegal and environmental contingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations, claims and actions, as is typical of the industry. These claims include, but are not limited to, contract claims, environmental claims, employment related claims, claims alleging injury or claims related to operational issues. Our assessment of the likely outcome of litigation matters is based on our judgment of a number of factors, including experience with similar matters, past history, precedents, relevant financial information and other evidence and facts specific to the matter. We accrue for contingencies when the occurrence of a material loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, based on our best estimate of the expected liability. The estimate of probable costs related to a contingency is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. The accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. Differences between the actual settlement costs, final judgments or fines from our estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. See Note (18) Commitments and Contingencies of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our legal, environmental and other regulatory contingencies.\nValuation of long-lived assets, indefinite-lived assets and goodwill\nWe assess our long-lived assets, such as definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually, as of October 31, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or the indefinite-lived assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment charge that reduces our earnings.\nWe perform our qualitative assessments of the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors relevant to each of our reporting segments, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value\ncalculations are based on subjective, judgmental assessments of projected revenue growth, fleet count, utilization, gross margin rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Many of these judgments are driven by crude oil prices. If the crude oil market declines and remains at low levels for a sustained period of time, we would expect to perform our impairment assessments more frequently and could record impairment charges.\nSee Note (2)(h) Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and (2)(i) Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on our impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, indefinite-lived assets and goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are accounted for based upon the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carry-forwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. We estimate our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time, while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year-end. Our effective tax rates will vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income or losses, fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In addition to our historical financial results, we consider forecasted market growth, earnings and taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. We establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.\nWe calculate our income tax liability based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of our tax liabilities. These differences are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to, (1) the requirement to pay a one-time transition tax on all undistributed earnings of\nforeign subsidiaries; (2) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (3) eliminating the alternative minimum tax; (4) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (5) changing rules related to use and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We evaluated the provisions of the Tax Act and determined only the reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% would have an impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements as of December 31, 2017. Accordingly, we recorded a provision to income taxes for our assessment of the tax impact of the Tax Act on ending deferred tax assets and liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance. The effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are not expected to have an adverse impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements. We will continue to assess the impact of other aspects of U.S. tax reform on our tax positions and our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nSee Note (17) Income Taxes of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLeases\nPer ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" lessees can classify leases as finance leases or operating leases, while lessors can classify leases as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases. All leases, with the exception of short-term leases, are capitalized on the balance sheet by recording a lease liability, which represents our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, along with a corresponding right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset being leased. For leases in which we are the lessee, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability, as in most cases we do not know the lessor's implicit rate in the lease. Establishing our lease obligations on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets require judgmental assessments of the term lengths of each and the interest rate yield curve that best represents the collateralized incremental borrowing rate to apply to each lease. We engage third-party specialists to assist us in determining the collateralized incremental borrowing rate yield curve. Errors in determining the lease term lengths and/or selecting the best representative collateralized incremental borrowing rate can have a material adverse effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For further details about our leases, see Note (16) Leases of Part II, \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor discussion on the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted, see Note (23) New Accounting Pronouncements of Part II, Item 8.

pricing pressures.\n\n- Net loss for 2019 was $106.2 million compared to net income of $59.3 million in 2018, mainly driven by lower revenue and higher merger and integration expenses related to the C&J merger. \n\n- The company has three reportable segments - Completion Services, Well Construction and Intervention Services, and Well Support Services. Completion Services is the largest segment and provides hydraulic fracturing, wireline, and pumpdown services. \n\n- Cash and cash equivalents were $255 million as of December 31, 2019.
