Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of this 2018 Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this 2018 Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a publicly traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is primarily engaged in the business of investing directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, and other real estate related securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nWe focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring residential mortgage loans and on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. At December 31, 2018, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 47% of our investment portfolio was residential mortgage loans, 47% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS and 6% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, respectively. At December 31, 2017, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 67% of our investment portfolio was residential mortgage loans, 22% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS and 11% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, respectively.\nOur investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. During 2018, we saw an increase in the relative value of Agency MBS over the residential mortgage loans and shifted our asset mix significantly in favor of Agency MBS as compared to 2017. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and preserve capital throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term.\nWe use leverage to increase returns and to finance the acquisition of our assets. Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We expect to finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, securitizations, warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, structured asset financing and offerings of our securities. We may manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources.\nMarket Conditions and our Strategy\nThere are several key factors that impact our financial results, including the interest rate environment and changes in LIBOR rates, U.S. unemployment rates and residential home prices, as well as residential mortgage origination and refinance activity. The interest rate environment is sensitive to actual and anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve actions, availability of adequate and efficient financing sources, rate volatility as well as other market factors. We have operated over the past several years and continue to operate in a volatile interest rate environment.\nFinancial results were mixed in 2018 as the S&P 500 experienced gains early in 2018 following the trends of 2016 and 2017. The S&P 500 declined in late January but then generally rebounded through September before falling from that point through the end of the year. Overall the S&P lost 6% in 2018, snapping a multi-year streak of gains. The Federal Reserve continued its plan of increasing short term rates, increasing the Fed Funds Target rate four times in 2018 with hikes in March, June, September and December. Longer-term interest rates generally increased during the year, with the 10-year Treasury hitting peaks in October and November before falling to the end of the year. Overall, the short end of the yield curve was up approximately 100 basis points driven by the four rate hikes while the 10-year Treasury was up only 28 basis points, creating a flattening of the yield curve.\nThe Case-Shiller housing index showed continued strength but the pace of growth started to slow down after the first quarter of 2018. U.S. mortgage rates trended up for most of the year before slipping in November and most of December. The rate of unemployment continues to be historically low, which is generally supportive of the U.S. housing economy.\nIn 2018, we added approximately $6.9 billion of Agency pass throughs, $943 million of Agency CMBS and $1.7 billion of Loans held for investments. To finance these acquisitions, we added approximately $6.8 billion of repurchase agreements and $1.8 billion of securitized debt.\nWhile the interest rate environment and investor demand was supportive of the value of the assets in our portfolio during 2018, the increase in short-term rates increased our economic interest expense and the cost to finance our portfolio. We added to our interest earning assets in 2018, growing from an average of $18.0 billion in 2017 to $21.8 billion in 2018 and reduced the asset yield by 50 basis points as our asset mix was shifted to lower yielding Agency MBS. Our average interest-bearing liabilities are up from $15.5 billion in 2017 to $18.9 billion in 2018 and economic borrowing costs are up approximately 10 basis points.\nOur book value per common share was $15.90 as of December 31, 2018 down from $16.85 as of December 31, 2017 as year-end interest rate declines caused losses in our hedge portfolio. Given the economic environment, we continue to seek high yielding investment opportunities that will deliver a durable dividend to our shareholders while managing risk.\nBusiness Operations\nNet

interest income of consolidated VIEs of $904,830, $914,022 and $678,623 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. See Note 8 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n(2) Includes interest expense of consolidated VIEs of $395,255, $390,858 and $249,708 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 8 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOur primary source of income is interest income earned on our assets, net of interest expense paid on our financing liabilities.\nOur net income available to common shareholders decreased by $123 million to $368 million, or $1.97 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $491 million, or $2.62 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to an increase in Net losses on derivatives of $129 million, and a decrease in Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value of $65 million, which was offset in part by an increase in Gains on extinguishment of debt of $62 million and a decrease in other than temporary impairment losses of $40 million, compared to the same period of, 2017.\nOur net income available to common shareholders decreased by $58 million to $491 million, or $2.62 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $549 million, or $2.93 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in other income of $95 million, which was a one-time receipt of additional remedies against other parties in the first quarter of 2016, an increase in losses on debt extinguishment of $35 million and an increase in preferred stock dividends of $31 million. These decreases to net income were offset in part by an increase in unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value of $52 million and an increase in unrealized gains on derivatives of $44 million, compared to the same period of 2016.\nInterest Income\nThe changes in our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017, are primarily driven by the repositioning of our balance sheet by significantly increasing Agency MBS investments.\nInterest income increased by $135 million, or 12%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.1 billion for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on Agency MBS of $135 million and Loans held for investments of $51 million, which was driven by higher average Agency MBS and Loan held for investment balances, as compared to the same period of 2017. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in interest income on Non-Agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs of $48 million, compared to the same period of 2017.\nInterest income increased by $205 million, or 22%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $934 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on residential mortgage loans of $260 million as compared to the same period of 2016. This increase was offset in part by lower interest income on our Agency MBS of $30 million and Non-agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs of $18 million, compared to the same period of 2016, as in 2017, we reduced our Agency MBS and Non-agency RMBS investments from 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $146 million, or 27%, to $679 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $533 million for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses on repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS of $85 million, repurchase agreements collateralized by RMBS from loan securitization of $38 million and securitized debt, collateralized by loans of $13 million, compared to the same period of 2017. Interest expense is also higher as a result of higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017. LIBOR rates have increased during the year ended 2018 following the increases in the Federal funds rate in March 2018, June 2018, September 2018 and December 2018. Interest expense for GAAP reporting does not include the periodic costs of our derivatives, which are reported separately in our GAAP financial statements.\nInterest expense increased by $185 million, or 53%, to $533 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $348 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased interest expense on securitized debt, collateralized by seasoned subprime residential mortgage loans of $143 million and repurchase agreements collateralized by RMBS from loan securitization of $41 million, which were driven primarily by higher securitized debt and repurchase agreements collateralized by loan balances compared to the same period of 2016. Interest expense is also higher in 2017 as a result of higher interest rates compared to 2016. LIBOR rates increased during the year ended 2017 following the increases in the Federal fund rate in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017 and December 2017.\nEconomic Net Interest Income\nOur Economic net interest income\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure, that equals interest income, less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate swaps. Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Net realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. However, Economic net interest income should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nThe following table reconciles the Economic net interest income to GAAP Net interest income for the periods presented.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Net Interest Income and the Average Earning Assets\nOur economic net interest income increased by $4 million to $593 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $589 million for the same period of 2017. Our net interest rate spread, which equals the yield on our average interest-earning assets less the economic average cost of funds decreased by 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. The net interest margin, which equals the economic net interest income as a percentage of the net average balance of our interest-earning assets less our interest-bearing liabilities also decreased by 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Average net interest-earning assets increased by $450 million to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. This increase in average net interest-earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in our average investments in Agency MBS and residential mortgage loans, which was partially offset by an increase in our repurchase agreements.\nEconomic Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nThe borrowing rate at which we are able to finance our assets using repurchase agreements and securitized debt is typically correlated to LIBOR and the term of the financing. The table below shows our average borrowed funds, economic interest expense, average cost of funds (inclusive of realized losses on interest rate swaps), average one-month LIBOR, average three-month LIBOR and average one-month LIBOR relative to average three-month LIBOR.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average Debt Balance\n</td> <td>Economic Interest Expense (1)\n</td> <td>Average Cost of Funds\n</td> <td>Average One-Month LIBOR\n</td> <td>Average Three-Month LIBOR\n</td> <td>Average One-Month LIBOR Relative to Average Three-Month LIBOR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Ratios have been annualized, dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,901,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.28\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,512,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,676,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>375,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,777,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,348,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.23\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,883,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,642,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Economic interest expense increased by $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and economic interest expense is a result of the increase in the amount of our repurchase agreements as well as the increase in LIBOR.\nAverage one-month and three-month LIBOR were up 91 basis points and 104 basis points, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017, contributing to the increase in economic interest expense. While we do acquire interest rate hedges to mitigate changes in interest rate risks, the hedges may not fully offset interest expense movements.\nNet Other-than-temporary Credit Impairment Losses\nOTTI losses are generated when fair values decline below our amortized cost basis, an unrealized loss, and the expected future cash flows decline from prior periods, an adverse change. When an unrealized loss and an adverse change in cash flows occur, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings. In addition, if we intend to sell a security, or believe we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the unrealized loss.\nOTTI losses were $22 million, $62 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of these amounts, $19 million, $53 million and $39 million of the OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were related to securities included in our consolidated VIEs. As of December 31, 2018, we had three Non-agency RMBS securities subject to OTTI in an unrealized loss position totaling $513 thousand for which we did not recognize impairment. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio and will record an OTTI for all investments in an unrealized loss position for which we do not believe we will recover our amortized cost prior to maturity or sale.\nNet Gains (losses) on derivatives\nOur interest rate swaps are primarily used to economically hedge the effects of changes in interest rates on our portfolio, specifically our floating rate debt. Therefore, we included the periodic interest costs of the interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on these economic hedges in our presentation of economic net interest income and our net interest spreads. As we do not account for these as hedges for GAAP presentation, we present these gains and losses separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease in the net periodic interest cost of the interest rate swaps are primarily due to the increase in interest rates and changes in our swap portfolio balance during the year.\nThe table below shows a summary of our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Periodic interest cost of interest rate swaps, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury Futures\n</td> <td>21,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,061\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaptions\n</td> <td>(1,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6,134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Derivative Assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaps - Terminations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(60,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>19,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(77,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rate Swaps\n</td> <td>(125,595\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>43,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury Futures\n</td> <td>(16,928\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaptions\n</td> <td>1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td>(141,162\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>47,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(122,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net gains and losses on our derivatives include both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses include the net cash paid and received on our interest rate swaps during the period as well as sales and settlements of our Treasury Futures and swaptions. The realized loss on our derivative instruments is primarily a result of the pay fixed leg of our swaps carried at a higher interest rate than the receive floating leg of these same swaps, resulting in a net payment on the periodic settlement of the swaps during the year.\nUnrealized gains and losses include the change in market value, period over period, on our derivatives portfolio. Changes in market value are generally a result of changes in interest rates. We may or may not ultimately realize these unrealized derivative gains and losses depending on trade activity, changes in interest rates and the values of the underlying securities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized total net losses on derivatives of $123 million, compared to net gains on derivatives of $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized losses on interest rate swaps in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThere were no swap terminations during the year ended December 31, 2018. We paid $16 million to terminate interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Treasury futures positions remained unchanged at $620 million of notional value during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We reduced our swaptions by $338 million of notional value to $53 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to the $391 million notional value at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in our derivative positions were a result of changes in our portfolio composition and changes in interest rates.\nWe had net realized gains on our short futures positions of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and net realized losses of $4 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The realized gains and losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates during these periods, which affects the Treasury futures prices, resulting in realized gains or losses on our short futures positions. Treasury futures are not included in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income.\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nWe have elected the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in earnings for our IO MBS securities, certain Non-Agency RMBS securities which receive residual cash flows, Loans held for investment, and the related financing for the loans consolidated as a VIE in our statement of financial condition. In addition, we have elected to account for Agency MBS investments acquired on or after July 1, 2017 under the fair value option. All Agency MBS investments owned prior to July 1, 2017 will continue to be carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) as available-for-sale investments.\nIO MBS securities represent the right to receive the interest on a pool of mortgage backed securities, including both Agency and Non-Agency mortgage pools. The fair value of IO MBS securities are heavily impacted by changes in expected prepayment\nrates. When IO securities prepay faster than expectations, the holder of the IO security will receive less interest on the investment due to the reduced principal.\nWe invest in overcollateralization classes of several seasoned pools of mortgage loans. These holdings generally do not have a traditional original and current face or notional face value amount and pay cash based on guidance in the trust documents when excess cash is available. Many of these holdings do not pay any interest and may never pay interest. We have elected to carry these overcollateralization classes at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\nThe Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $47 million. The year to date 2018 gains on financial instruments at fair value were primarily driven by unrealized gains on Securitized debt collateralized by loans held for investment of $52 million and Non-Agency RMBS of $21 million, offset in part by unrealized losses on Loans held for investments of $27 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value were $111 million, which were primarily driven by unrealized gains on Loans held for investment of $206 million, offset in part by unrealized losses on Securitized debt collateralized by loans held for investment of $78 million.\nGains and Losses on Sales of Assets and Extinguishment of Securitized Debt\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had net realized losses of $3 million, net realized gains of $9 million and $18 million, respectively, on sales of investments. We do not forecast sales of investments as we generally expect to invest for long term gains. However, from time to time, we may sell assets to create liquidity necessary to pursue new opportunities, achieve targeted leverage ratios as well as for gains when prices indicate a sale is most beneficial to us, or is the most prudent course of action to maintain a targeted risk adjusted yield for our investors.\nWhen we acquire our outstanding securitized debt, we extinguish the outstanding debt and recognize a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the debt and the cost to acquire the debt which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThere were no securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS with an amortized cost balance of $166 thousand for $167 thousand. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1 thousand, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS with an amortized cost balance of $10 million for $11 million. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $355 thousand, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $861 million for $835 million. These transactions resulted in a net gain on the extinguishment of debt of $26 million, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $1.0 billion for $1.1 billion. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $35 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $609 million for $609 million. These transactions resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $122 thousand. This loss is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016. As our securitized debt is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings some of these losses were recognized during prior periods.\nCompensation, General and Administrative Expenses and Deal Expenses\nThe table below shows our total compensation and benefit expense, general and administrative, or G&A expenses, and deal expenses as compared to average total assets and average equity for the periods presented.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Compensation, G&A and Deal Expenses\n</td> <td>Total Compensation, G&A and Deal Expenses/Average Assets\n</td> <td>Total Compensation, G&A and Deal Expenses/Average Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Ratios have been annualized, dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompensation and benefit costs were $35 million, $30 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases in Compensation and benefit costs for each year were primarily driven by higher bonuses and stock based compensation.\nG&A expenses were $24 million, $18 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The G&A expenses are primarily comprised of auditing, information technology, legal and consulting expenses. The increases in G&A expenses during 2018, were primarily driven by higher legal expenses, due diligence fees and investment manager fees as compared to the same period of 2017. G&A expenses were relatively unchanged during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe Company incurred deal expenses of $8 million, $21 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in deal expenses year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by lower securitization activity compared to the same period of 2017. The deal expenses increased during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased securitization activity as during 2017.\nServicing Fees\nServicing fees expenses were $41 million, $42 million and $31 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These servicing fees are related to the consolidation of the whole loan securitization vehicles and are paid from interest income earned by the VIEs. The servicing fees range from 20 to 50 basis points of unpaid principal balances of our consolidated VIEs.\nCore earnings\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income excluding unrealized gains on the aggregate portfolio, impairment losses, realized gains on sales of investments, realized gains or losses on futures, realized gains or losses on swap terminations, gain on deconsolidation, extinguishment of debt and certain other non-recurring gains or losses. As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk and other expenses. Management believes that the presentation of core earnings provides investors with a useful measure to facilitate comparisons of financial performance between our REIT peers, but has important limitations. We believe core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions but is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides GAAP measures of net income and net income per basic share available to common stockholders for the periods presented and details with respect to reconciling the line items to core earnings and related per

The amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security is more favorable than previously estimated, a portion of the amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be transferred to accretable discount and accreted into interest income over time.

Our principal sources of capital and funds for additional investments primarily include earnings, principal paydowns and sales from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities including warehouse facilities, and proceeds from equity or other securities offerings. We also maintain a certain amount of liquid, un-levered securities that we can either finance with recourse or sell if we have liquidity needs.\nTo meet our short term (one year or less) liquidity needs, we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements and, subject to market conditions, other types of financing. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, as to repayment and margin requirements. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts or the percentage that is subtracted from the value of RMBS that collateralizes the financing, purchase price maintenance requirements, and requirements that all disputes related to the repurchase agreement be litigated or arbitrated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our lenders.\nBased on our current portfolio, leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements, we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term liquidity requirements. However, a decline in the value of our collateral could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns. If our cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell investments, potentially at a loss, issue debt or additional common or preferred equity securities.\nTo meet our longer term liquidity needs (greater than one year), we expect our principal sources of capital and funds to continue to be provided by earnings, principal paydowns and sales from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, as well as proceeds from equity or other securities offerings.\nIn addition to the principal sources of capital described above, we may enter into warehouse facilities and use longer dated structured repurchase agreements. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these facilities, and the investment opportunities available to us.\nCurrent Period\nWe held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $47 million, $64 million and $178 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities described below, our cash position decreased by $17 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nOur operating activities provided net cash of approximately $298 million, $487 million and $553 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cash provided by our operations is primarily due to interest received in excess of interest paid during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, interest received net of interest paid was $636 million, $580 million and $582 million, respectively.\nOur investing activities used cash of $6.0 billion, $4.3 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash for investment purchases of $9.7 billion, primarily Agency MBS and Loans held for investments. This cash used was offset in part by cash received for principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency RMBS, and Loans held for investments of $2.9 billion and sale of investments of $791 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased investments of $7.9 billion, primarily Loans held for investments. This cash used was offset in part by cash received for principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and securitized loans of $2.8 billion and investment sales of $749 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased investments of $6.1 billion, primarily Loans held for investments. The cash used was offset in part by cash received on sales of investments of $2.7 billion, primarily Agency RMBS, and principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and securitized loans of $2.2 billion.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $5.7 billion, $3.7 billion and $781 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received cash from net proceeds on our repurchase agreements of $6.8 billion, debt issuance of $1.8 billion, and Series C preferred stock offering of $252 million. These receipts of cash were offset in part by cash used for repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $2.7 billion, common and preferred dividends paid of $418 million, and repurchase of common stock of $15 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received cash of $5.2 billion from debt issuance, $1.6 billion from net proceeds received on repurchase agreements\nand $314 million from our Series B preferred stock offering. These receipts of cash provided were offset in part by repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $3.0 billion and common and preferred dividends paid of $412 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received cash of $4.8 billion on debt issuance. The cash provided was offset in part by net proceeds paid on repurchase agreements of $1.8 billion, repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $1.9 billion, and dividends paid of $454 million.\nOur recourse leverage was 3.8:1 and 2.0:1 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, respectively. Our recourse leverage excludes the securitized debt which can only be repaid from the proceeds on the assets securing this debt in their respective VIEs. Our recourse leverage is presented as a ratio of our repurchase agreements, which are recourse to our assets and our equity.\nWe believe that our cash balances and liquid Agency portfolio provides an appropriate level of liquidity. Even though we have unrestricted Agency MBS investments, we expect to meet our future cash needs primarily from principal and interest payments on our portfolio and do not anticipate the need to sell unrestricted Agency MBS investments to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to continue to finance our MBS portfolio largely through repurchase agreements and loans through the securitization market. In addition, we may from time to time sell securities, issue debt, or issue equity as a source of cash to fund new purchases.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 the remaining maturities on our RMBS and loan repurchase agreements were as follows.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overnight\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 to 29 days\n</td> <td>6,326,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,745,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 to 59 days\n</td> <td>4,620,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60 to 89 days\n</td> <td>1,504,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90 to 119 days\n</td> <td>169,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than or equal to 120 days\n</td> <td>1,409,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>705,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,250,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average remaining maturity of Repurchase agreements secured by:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>30 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency MBS and Loans held for investment\n</td> <td>231 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe collateralize the repurchase agreements we use to finance our operations with our MBS investments. Our counterparties negotiate a \u2018haircut', which is the difference expressed in percentage terms between the fair value of the collateral and the amount the counterparty will lend to us, when we enter into a financing transaction. The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with holding the MBS by the lender. The haircut provides lenders with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for a margin call to be issued or margin to be returned as normal daily increases or decreases in MBS market values occur. At December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 4.8% and 5.1%, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investments was 24.7% compared to 26.2% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average borrowing rates for our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 2.55% and Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investments was 4.04%. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average borrowing rates for our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 1.47% and Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investment was 3.41%, respectively.\nAs the fair value of the Non-Agency MBS is more difficult to determine, as well as more volatile period to period than Agency MBS, the Non-Agency MBS typically requires a larger haircut. In addition, when financing assets using standard form of SIFMA Master Repurchase Agreements, the counterparty to the agreement typically nets its exposure to us on all outstanding repurchase agreements and issues margin calls if movement of the fair values of the assets in the aggregate exceeds their allowable exposure to us. A decline in asset fair values could create a margin call, or may create no margin call depending on the counterparty's specific policy. In addition, counterparties consider a number of factors, including their aggregate exposure to us as a whole and the number of days remaining before the repurchase transaction closes prior to issuing a margin call. See\nNote 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on how we determine the fair values of the RMBS collateralizing our repurchase agreements.\nThe table below presents our average daily repurchase balance and the repurchase balance at each period end for the periods presented. Our balance at period-end tends to fluctuate from the average daily balances due to the adjusting of the size of our portfolio by using leverage. We continue to deploy capital for strategic purchases of investments.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>Average Repurchase Balance\n</td> <td>Repurchase Balance at Period End\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,816,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,324,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,250,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,482,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,600,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,082,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,235,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,143,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,527,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,127,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,257,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,202,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are not required to maintain any specific leverage ratio. We believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our total debt was approximately $22.6 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively, which represented a leverage ratio for both periods of approximately 6.1:1 and 4.6:1. We include our repurchase agreements and securitized debt in the numerator of our leverage ratio and stockholders' equity as the denominator.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had repurchase agreements with 30 counterparties. All of our repurchase agreements are secured by Agency, Non-Agency RMBS and Loans held for investments or, in limited circumstances, cash. Under these repurchase agreements we may not be able to reclaim our collateral but still be obligated to pay our repurchase obligations. We mitigate this risk by spreading our exposure to multiple counterparties, as well as ensuring our counterparties are highly rated. Therefore, we believe the risk of loss of our collateral posted is mitigated by the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $15.8 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, of securities pledged against our repurchase agreement obligations.\nAt December 31, 2018, our repurchase agreements have original maturities ranging from less than 30 days to 1,817 days and a weighted average original maturity of 135 days. We expect to renew most of our repurchase agreements at maturity. When we renew our repurchase agreements, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain as favorable an interest rate as a result of rising rates.\nWe offset the interest rate risk of our repurchase agreements primarily through the use of interest rate swaps, swaptions and treasury futures. The average remaining maturities on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 range from less than 1 year to 30 years and have a weighted average maturity of approximately 7 years. All of our swaps are cleared by a central clearing house. When our interest rate swaps are in a net loss position (expected cash payments are in excess of expected cash receipts on the swaps), we post collateral as required by the terms of our swap agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we have two swaption counterparties and two futures counterparties.\nExposure to Financial Counterparties\nWe actively manage the number of repurchase agreement counterparties. The following table summarizes our exposure to our repurchase agreement counterparties at December 31, 2018:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Country\n</td> <td>Number of Counterparties\n</td> <td>Repurchase Agreement Financing\n</td> <td>Interest Rate Swaps at Fair Value\n</td> <td>Exposure (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,528,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(118,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>2,557,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>1,921,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>870,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>596,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>590,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switzerland\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>514,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Korea\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>365,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>86,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(82,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,713,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the amount of securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and unrealized loss on swaps for each counterparty.\nOver the past several years, several large European financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large European banks or institutions. Some of these financial institutions or their U.S. subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions. We have entered into repurchase agreements or exchange cleared interest rate swaps with 6 counterparties as of December 31, 2018 that are either domiciled in Europe or is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a European-domiciled financial institution.\nIf the European credit volatility, including countries that may choose to leave the Euro zone as Britain has, continues to impact these major European financial institutions, it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their U.S. subsidiaries. Our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events. We monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions, financial relief plans, credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties. We make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps, or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary.\nAt December 31, 2018, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nStockholders' Equity\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors reauthorized $100 million under our share repurchase program, or the Repurchase Program. Such authorization does not have an expiration date and, at present, there is no intention to modify or otherwise rescind such authorization. Shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market, including through block purchases, through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Among other factors, we intend to only consider repurchasing shares of our common stock when the purchase price is less than the last publicly reported book value per common share. In addition, we do not intend to repurchase any shares from directors, officers or other affiliates. The program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases will be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases.\nPursuant to our Repurchase Program, during the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 883 thousand shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.81 per share for a total of $15 million. There were no other stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other than a de minimis amount issued under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and\nas discussed below under Restricted Stock Grants,\u201d we did not issue any common shares during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nIn September 2018, we issued 10,400,000 shares of 7.75% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Series C Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $25.00 per share and for net proceeds to us of $252 million. The Series C Preferred Stock is redeemable at $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) exclusively at our option commencing in September 30, 2025, subject to our right, under limited circumstances, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock prior to that date. The initial dividend rate for the Series C Preferred Stock, from and including September 20, 2018, to but not including September 30, 2025, will be equal to 7.75% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual rate of $1.9375 per share). On and after September 30, 2025, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will accumulate at a percentage of the $25.00 liquidation preference equal to an annual floating rate of the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.743% per annum. The Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, when and as declared, a dividend at a rate of 7.75% per year on the $25.00 liquidation preference before the common stock is paid any dividends and is senior to the common stock with respect to distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nWe declared dividends to Series A preferred stockholders of $12 million, or $2.00 per preferred share, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe declared dividends to Series B preferred stockholders of $26 million and $22 million, or $2.00 and $1.68 per preferred share, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe declared dividends to Series C preferred stock holders of $6 million, or $0.54 per preferred share during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRestricted Stock Unit Grants\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted certain of our employees and directors Restricted Stock Units, or RSU awards. RSU awards are designed to reward our employees for services provided over the previous year. Generally, the RSU awards vest equally over a three-year period beginning from the grant date and will fully vest after three years. The RSU awards are valued at the market price of our common stock on the grant date and the employees must be employed by us on the vesting dates to receive the RSU awards. We granted 335 thousand and 204 thousand RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, with a grant date fair value of $6 million and $4 million, respectively, which will be recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted certain employees 133 thousand and 144 thousand Performance Share Units, or PSU awards, respectively. PSU awards are designed to align compensation with our future performance. The PSU awards include a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The final number of shares that will vest will be between 0% to 150% of the total PSU awards granted based on our total shareholder return as compared to an index of comparable financial institutions and will cliff vest at the end of the performance period. The PSU awards are measured at fair value on the grant date which will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year vesting period. Fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model developed to value the specific features of the PSU awards, including market based conditions. Inputs into the model include our historical volatility, the peer average historical volatility, and the correlation coefficient of the volatility. In addition, inputs also included the share price at the beginning of the measurement period and an estimated total shareholder return for both us and the peer group of comparable financial institutions. Based on the model results, the 133 thousand PSU awards granted during 2018 had a grant date value of $2 million that will cliff vest on December 31, 2020. The 144 thousand PSU awards granted during 2017 had a grant date value of $3 million which will cliff vest on December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were approximately 1.2 million and 770 thousand unvested shares of restricted stock units issued to our employees, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The estimated principal repayment schedule of the securitized debt is based on expected cash flows of the residential mortgage loans or RMBS, as adjusted for expected principal writedowns on the underlying collateral of the debt.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Within One Year\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>Greater Than or Equal to Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,521,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>23,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt at fair value, collateralized by loans held for investment\n</td> <td>1,608,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,587,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,949,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,237,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,382,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on RMBS repurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td>85,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on securitized debt (1)\n</td> <td>372,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,652,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,612,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,413,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,529,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,663,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,218,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Within One Year\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>Greater Than or Equal to Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,903,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,250,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>42,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt at fair value, collateralized by loans held for investment\n</td> <td>1,819,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,872,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,140,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,439,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,271,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on RMBS repurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td>30,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on securitized debt (1)\n</td> <td>392,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,187,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,873,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,525,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,917,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,503,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nNot included in the table above are the unfunded construction loan commitments of $1.1 billion and $567 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which will primarily be paid within one year of reported periods and are reported under Payables for investments purchased in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nWe have made a $25 thousand investment to acquire 24.9% ownership interest in KAH Capital through one of our taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition to the investment in KAH Capital, we have made a $150 million capital commitment to Hains Point (Hains Point), which is KAH Capital's initial fund for which we are the sole investor. KAH Capital will manage the investments in Hains Point including asset selection, repurchase and other financing arrangements as well as hedging transactions. Capital calls for investments made in Hains Point are subject to our consent and approval. We expect that KAH Capital will earn $6.5 million over approximately 3 years for its investment advisory services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nDividends\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Before we pay any dividend, we must first meet any operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our financing facilities and other debt payable.\nInflation\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our Board of Directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and financial condition are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies and accounting estimates are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are described in this section. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires management to make assumptions or judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made or require significant management judgment in interpreting the accounting literature. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, or other accounting judgments were made, this could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These critical accounting policies were developed by management, and reviewed by our auditors, prior to being presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe consolidated financial statements include, on a consolidated basis, our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including OTTI of Non-Agency RMBS, valuation of Loans held for investments, Agency and Non-Agency RMBS and interest rate swaps and income recognition on Loans held for investments and Non-Agency RMBS. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nInterest Income and Impairment on Non-Agency and Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nWe invest in RMBS representing interests in obligations backed by pools of residential mortgage loans. We delineate between (1) Agency RMBS and (2) Non-Agency RMBS as follows: The Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, and other RMBS representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of residential mortgage loans issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest repayment by agencies of the U.S. Government or federally chartered corporations such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Non-Agency RMBS are not issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and are therefore subject to credit risk.\nWe hold certain of our RMBS as available-for-sale, record these investments at estimated fair value as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, and include unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in Other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unrealized gains and losses on RMBS investments for which we have elected fair value option, are included in Net unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, as part of the overall management of our portfolio, we may sell any of our RMBS investments and recognize a realized gain or loss as a component of earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations utilizing the average method.\nOur accounting policies for recognition of interest income and OTTI related to RMBS are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As noted therein, there are three different accounting models that may be applicable for purposes of the recognition of interest income and OTTI on RMBS, and include the following:\nASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (ASC 310-20) - applies to certain Agency MBS and certain Non-Agency RMBS of high credit quality that, at the time of purchase, we expect to collect all contractual cash flows and the security cannot be contractually prepaid in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30) - applies to Non-Agency RMBS where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality and we do not expect to collect all contractual cash flows of the security.\nASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (ASC 325-40) - applies to certain Non-Agency RMBS and Agency MBS for which we have elected fair value option and are not within the scope of ASC 310-20 or ASC 310-30. These include Non-Agency RMBS which is not of high credit quality at the time of purchase or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nThe determination of which accounting model to apply will have a significant impact on the amounts of interest income and OTTI losses reflected in the results of operations because each accounting model has different requirements regarding the cash flows used to calculate interest income and impairments (i.e., contractual cash flows vs. expected cash flows) and the manner of such calculations, and the impact of changes in prepayment assumptions on interest income or OTTI losses.\nFor Agency and Non-Agency MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20, the amount of interest income recorded over the life of a security will be equal to the contractual cash flows of the security and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discount or premium. The amount of interest income reported in any particular financial reporting period will, however, vary depending on the actual and estimated prepayments on the security. For Agency MBS purchased at a premium to the principal amount, increases in prepayment speeds will generally result in a reduction of the recorded amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period whereas decreases in prepayment speeds will generally result in an increase in the amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period. The opposite is generally the case for Agency MBS purchased at a discount to the principal amount. That is, as prepayment speeds increase, interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally increase, whereas interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally decrease when prepayment speeds decline. However, volatility in the reported amount of interest income will result when there are significant changes in actual or future expected prepayment speeds regardless of the direction of those changes. This volatility is because the accounting model that we apply under ASC 310-20 requires us to record a cumulative adjustment, on a retrospective basis from the acquisition date of the security, when there are changes in prepayment speeds. That cumulative adjustment at each reporting date is intended to reflect the most current estimate of the timing of prepayments over the life of the security (both actual prepayments that have occurred in the past and the timing of prepayments that will occur in the future).\nAgency MBS and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20 may experience an OTTI loss. The OTTI loss recognized in earnings will be calculated based on the present value of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to recognition of an OTTI loss, we recognize income on these securities under ASC 310-30 as further described below.\nFor Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40, the reported amounts of interest income and OTTI are significantly impacted by management judgments around both the amount and timing of credit losses (defaults) and prepayments. Interest income on these Non-Agency RMBS is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. Furthermore, the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments also impacts the amount of OTTI losses recognized in earnings.\nNon-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40 is generally purchased at a discount to the principal amount. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calculate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Depending on the nature of the changes in the timing or amount of cash flows expected to be collected, whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayment assumptions, the following will occur:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>If there is a positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, the effective interest rate in future accounting periods may increase resulting in an increase in the reported amount of interest income in future periods. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes must be considered significant for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 for the effective interest rate in future accounting periods to increase. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has increased from the previous estimate. This can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from reductions in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, a positive change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the positive impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the negative impact of increased defaults, or when the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults exceeds the negative impact of an extension of the timing of receipt of cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>If there is a negative (or adverse) change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, and the securities' fair value is below its amortized cost, an OTTI loss equal to the adverse change in cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the securities' effective rate before impairment, is required to be recorded in current period earnings. For Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in future periods will decline because of the reduced balance of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 325-40, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income during the period directly after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in such future period will decline, absent an increase in cash flows expected to be collected, because of the reduced amount of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. An adverse change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has decreased from the most previous estimate. This change can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from increases in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, an adverse change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the negative impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults, or when the negative impact of an increase in estimated defaults exceeds the positive impact of a shortening of the timing of receipt of cash flows.\nThe accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 are impacted by both assumptions of prepayments and assumptions of credit losses (defaults) and, accordingly, changes in the amounts of recorded interest income or OTTI losses over financial reporting periods cannot be considered to result solely from the impact of changes in the credit profile of the investment or solely from the impact of changes in prepayment speeds. Furthermore, while there may be some level of correlation between assumptions for defaults and prepayments as general market interest rates change, in the recent market conditions that correlation has not been direct or predictable.\nInterest Income on Loans held for investments at fair value\nInterest income on Loans held for investments at fair value is accounted for under ASC 325-40. Interest income on these Loans held for investments at fair value is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calculate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected.\nDetermination of appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS is dependent on management's assessment and judgment related to the following factors made as of the acquisition date:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our assessment of the credit quality of the asset, including its credit rating at the acquisition date and whether the security has experienced deterioration in credit quality since its inception.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our assessment of the probability of collection of all contractual cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our assessment of whether the security can be contractually prepaid such that we would not recover our initial investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most critical judgment inherent in the determination of the appropriate accounting model is our assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. In making this accounting judgment, we consider expected defaults and prepayments as further described below.\nImpact of prepayment assumptions on MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20\nChanges in actual prepayments will impact the amount of interest income recognized in each financial reporting period for MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20. We estimate expected prepayment as further described below.\nImpact of default and prepayment assumptions on Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40\nIn determining the OTTI related to credit losses for Non-Agency RMBS securities accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows is the effective interest rate or effective yield used for income recognition purposes.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. For VIEs' that do not have substantial on-going activities, the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance may be determined by an entity's involvement with the design of the VIE.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition contain the assets and liabilities related to twenty-nine consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs. Due to the non-recourse nature of these VIEs our net exposure to loss from investments in these entities is limited to our retained beneficial interests.\nAt December 31, 2018, we consolidated twenty-five residential mortgage loan securitizations and four RMBS re-securitization transactions which are VIEs. The residential mortgage loan securitizations contain jumbo prime and sub prime residential mortgage loans. The RMBS re-securitization transactions contain Non-Agency RMBS comprised of primarily what we classify as collateral backed by Alt-A first lien mortgages of 2005-2007 vintages. We categorize collateral as Alt-A regardless of whether the loans were originally described as prime\u201d if the behavior of the collateral when we purchased the security more resembles typical Alt-A collateral. We define Alt-A collateral characteristics to be evidenced by the 60+ day delinquency bucket of the pool being greater than 5% and the weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination as greater than 650.\nOur determination to consolidate these twenty-nine VIEs was significantly influenced by management's judgment related to the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the identification of the party with the power over such activities. For the residential mortgage loan securitizations, we determined that our ability to direct the servicer resulted in us having the power that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE. For the four consolidated RMBS re-securitization transactions, we determined that no party has power over any ongoing activities of the entities and therefore the determination of the primary beneficiary should be based on involvement with the initial design of the entity. Since we transferred the RMBS to the securitization entities, we determined we had the power over the design of the entity, which resulted in us being considered the primary beneficiary. This determination was influenced by the amount of economic exposure to the financial performance of the entity and required a significant management judgment in determining that we should consolidate these four entities.\nDue to the consolidation of these VIEs, our actual ownership interests in the securitization and re-securitizations have been eliminated in consolidation and the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect both the assets held and non-recourse debt issued to third parties by these VIEs. In addition, our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts\nrelated to the assets and liabilities of the VIEs as opposed to the actual economic interests we own in these VIEs. Our interest in these VIEs is restricted to the beneficial interests we retained in these transactions. We are not obligated to provide any financial support to these VIEs.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition separately present: (i) our direct assets and liabilities, and (ii) the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. Assets of all consolidated VIEs can only be used to satisfy the obligations of those VIEs, and the liabilities of consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.\nWe have aggregated all the assets and liabilities of the consolidated securitization vehicles due to our determination that these entities are substantively similar and therefore a further disaggregated presentation would not be more meaningful. The notes to our consolidated financial statements describe our direct assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our investments in VIEs.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. Specifically, this guidance defines fair value based on exit price, or the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for RMBS are based on models that consider the estimated cash flows expected to be collected from the underlying collateral and an estimated market-based yield reflective of the unique attributes of the tranche including, but not limited to, assumptions related to prepayment speeds, the frequency and severity of defaults and attributes of the collateral underlying such securities. Estimates of the fair value of RMBS are particularly sensitive to assumptions related to the expected timing of prepayments, the extent of defaults, and the severity of expected losses. Management reviews the fair values generated by the model to determine whether prices are reflective of the current market. Management indirectly corroborates its estimates of the fair value using pricing models by comparing its results to independent prices provided by third party pricing services.\nTo the extent the inputs used to estimate fair value are observable, the values would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise they would be categorized as Level 3. The Company's fair value estimation process utilizes inputs other than quoted prices that are observed in the market. The Company's estimate of prepayment, default and severity curves all involve adjustments that are deemed to be significant to the fair value measurement process, which renders the resulting Non-Agency fair value estimates Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets represent approximately 55% and 79% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represent approximately 98% and 100% of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2(o) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company or expected to be adopted by the Company in the future.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of this 2018 Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this 2018 Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a publicly traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is primarily engaged in the business of investing directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, and other real estate related securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nWe focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring residential mortgage loans and on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. At December 31, 2018, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 47% of our investment portfolio was residential mortgage loans, 47% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS and 6% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, respectively. At December 31, 2017, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 67% of our investment portfolio was residential mortgage loans, 22% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS and 11% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, respectively.\nOur investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. During 2018, we saw an increase in the relative value of Agency MBS over the residential mortgage loans and shifted our asset mix significantly in favor of Agency MBS as compared to 2017. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and preserve capital throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term.\nWe use leverage to increase returns and to finance the acquisition of our assets. Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We expect to finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, securitizations, warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, structured asset financing and offerings of our securities. We may manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources.\nMarket Conditions and our Strategy\nThere are several key factors that impact our financial results, including the interest rate environment and changes in LIBOR rates, U.S. unemployment rates and residential home prices, as well as residential mortgage origination and refinance activity. The interest rate environment is sensitive to actual and anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve actions, availability of adequate and efficient financing sources, rate volatility as well as other market factors. We have operated over the past several years and continue to operate in a volatile interest rate environment.\nFinancial results were mixed in 2018 as the S&P 500 experienced gains early in 2018 following the trends of 2016 and 2017. The S&P 500 declined in late January but then generally rebounded through September before falling from that point through the end of the year. Overall the S&P lost 6% in 2018, snapping a multi-year streak of gains. The Federal Reserve continued its plan of increasing short term rates, increasing the Fed Funds Target rate four times in 2018 with hikes in March, June, September and December. Longer-term interest rates generally increased during the year, with the 10-year Treasury hitting peaks in October and November before falling to the end of the year. Overall, the short end of the yield curve was up approximately 100 basis points driven by the four rate hikes while the 10-year Treasury was up only 28 basis points, creating a flattening of the yield curve.\nThe Case-Shiller housing index showed continued strength but the pace of growth started to slow down after the first quarter of 2018. U.S. mortgage rates trended up for most of the year before slipping in November and most of December. The rate of unemployment continues to be historically low, which is generally supportive of the U.S. housing economy.\nIn 2018, we added approximately $6.9 billion of Agency pass throughs, $943 million of Agency CMBS and $1.7 billion of Loans held for investments. To finance these acquisitions, we added approximately $6.8 billion of repurchase agreements and $1.8 billion of securitized debt.\nWhile the interest rate environment and investor demand was supportive of the value of the assets in our portfolio during 2018, the increase in short-term rates increased our economic interest expense and the cost to finance our portfolio. We added to our interest earning assets in 2018, growing from an average of $18.0 billion in 2017 to $21.8 billion in 2018 and reduced the asset yield by 50 basis points as our asset mix was shifted to lower yielding Agency MBS. Our average interest-bearing liabilities are up from $15.5 billion in 2017 to $18.9 billion in 2018 and economic borrowing costs are up approximately 10 basis points.\nOur book value per common share was $15.90 as of December 31, 2018 down from $16.85 as of December 31, 2017 as year-end interest rate declines caused losses in our hedge portfolio. Given the economic environment, we continue to seek high yielding investment opportunities that will deliver a durable dividend to our shareholders while managing risk.\nBusiness Operations\nNet

interest income of consolidated VIEs of $904,830, $914,022 and $678,623 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. See Note 8 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n(2) Includes interest expense of consolidated VIEs of $395,255, $390,858 and $249,708 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 8 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOur primary source of income is interest income earned on our assets, net of interest expense paid on our financing liabilities.\nOur net income available to common shareholders decreased by $123 million to $368 million, or $1.97 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $491 million, or $2.62 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to an increase in Net losses on derivatives of $129 million, and a decrease in Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value of $65 million, which was offset in part by an increase in Gains on extinguishment of debt of $62 million and a decrease in other than temporary impairment losses of $40 million, compared to the same period of, 2017.\nOur net income available to common shareholders decreased by $58 million to $491 million, or $2.62 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $549 million, or $2.93 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in other income of $95 million, which was a one-time receipt of additional remedies against other parties in the first quarter of 2016, an increase in losses on debt extinguishment of $35 million and an increase in preferred stock dividends of $31 million. These decreases to net income were offset in part by an increase in unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value of $52 million and an increase in unrealized gains on derivatives of $44 million, compared to the same period of 2016.\nInterest Income\nThe changes in our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017, are primarily driven by the repositioning of our balance sheet by significantly increasing Agency MBS investments.\nInterest income increased by $135 million, or 12%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.1 billion for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on Agency MBS of $135 million and Loans held for investments of $51 million, which was driven by higher average Agency MBS and Loan held for investment balances, as compared to the same period of 2017. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in interest income on Non-Agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs of $48 million, compared to the same period of 2017.\nInterest income increased by $205 million, or 22%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $934 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on residential mortgage loans of $260 million as compared to the same period of 2016. This increase was offset in part by lower interest income on our Agency MBS of $30 million and Non-agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs of $18 million, compared to the same period of 2016, as in 2017, we reduced our Agency MBS and Non-agency RMBS investments from 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $146 million, or 27%, to $679 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $533 million for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses on repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS of $85 million, repurchase agreements collateralized by RMBS from loan securitization of $38 million and securitized debt, collateralized by loans of $13 million, compared to the same period of 2017. Interest expense is also higher as a result of higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017. LIBOR rates have increased during the year ended 2018 following the increases in the Federal funds rate in March 2018, June 2018, September 2018 and December 2018. Interest expense for GAAP reporting does not include the periodic costs of our derivatives, which are reported separately in our GAAP financial statements.\nInterest expense increased by $185 million, or 53%, to $533 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $348 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased interest expense on securitized debt, collateralized by seasoned subprime residential mortgage loans of $143 million and repurchase agreements collateralized by RMBS from loan securitization of $41 million, which were driven primarily by higher securitized debt and repurchase agreements collateralized by loan balances compared to the same period of 2016. Interest expense is also higher in 2017 as a result of higher interest rates compared to 2016. LIBOR rates increased during the year ended 2017 following the increases in the Federal fund rate in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017 and December 2017.\nEconomic Net Interest Income\nOur Economic net interest income\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure, that equals interest income, less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate swaps. Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Net realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. However, Economic net interest income should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nThe following table reconciles the Economic net interest income to GAAP Net interest income for the periods presented.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Net Interest Income and the Average Earning Assets\nOur economic net interest income increased by $4 million to $593 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $589 million for the same period of 2017. Our net interest rate spread, which equals the yield on our average interest-earning assets less the economic average cost of funds decreased by 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. The net interest margin, which equals the economic net interest income as a percentage of the net average balance of our interest-earning assets less our interest-bearing liabilities also decreased by 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Average net interest-earning assets increased by $450 million to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. This increase in average net interest-earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in our average investments in Agency MBS and residential mortgage loans, which was partially offset by an increase in our repurchase agreements.\nEconomic Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nThe borrowing rate at which we are able to finance our assets using repurchase agreements and securitized debt is typically correlated to LIBOR and the term of the financing. The table below shows our average borrowed funds, economic interest expense, average cost of funds (inclusive of realized losses on interest rate swaps), average one-month LIBOR, average three-month LIBOR and average one-month LIBOR relative to average three-month LIBOR.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average Debt Balance\n</td> <td>Economic Interest Expense (1)\n</td> <td>Average Cost of Funds\n</td> <td>Average One-Month LIBOR\n</td> <td>Average Three-Month LIBOR\n</td> <td>Average One-Month LIBOR Relative to Average Three-Month LIBOR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Ratios have been annualized, dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,901,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.28\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,512,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,676,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>375,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,777,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,348,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.23\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,883,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,642,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Economic interest expense increased by $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and economic interest expense is a result of the increase in the amount of our repurchase agreements as well as the increase in LIBOR.\nAverage one-month and three-month LIBOR were up 91 basis points and 104 basis points, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017, contributing to the increase in economic interest expense. While we do acquire interest rate hedges to mitigate changes in interest rate risks, the hedges may not fully offset interest expense movements.\nNet Other-than-temporary Credit Impairment Losses\nOTTI losses are generated when fair values decline below our amortized cost basis, an unrealized loss, and the expected future cash flows decline from prior periods, an adverse change. When an unrealized loss and an adverse change in cash flows occur, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings. In addition, if we intend to sell a security, or believe we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the unrealized loss.\nOTTI losses were $22 million, $62 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of these amounts, $19 million, $53 million and $39 million of the OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were related to securities included in our consolidated VIEs. As of December 31, 2018, we had three Non-agency RMBS securities subject to OTTI in an unrealized loss position totaling $513 thousand for which we did not recognize impairment. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio and will record an OTTI for all investments in an unrealized loss position for which we do not believe we will recover our amortized cost prior to maturity or sale.\nNet Gains (losses) on derivatives\nOur interest rate swaps are primarily used to economically hedge the effects of changes in interest rates on our portfolio, specifically our floating rate debt. Therefore, we included the periodic interest costs of the interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on these economic hedges in our presentation of economic net interest income and our net interest spreads. As we do not account for these as hedges for GAAP presentation, we present these gains and losses separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease in the net periodic interest cost of the interest rate swaps are primarily due to the increase in interest rates and changes in our swap portfolio balance during the year.\nThe table below shows a summary of our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Periodic interest cost of interest rate swaps, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury Futures\n</td> <td>21,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,061\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaptions\n</td> <td>(1,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6,134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Derivative Assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaps - Terminations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(60,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>19,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(77,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rate Swaps\n</td> <td>(125,595\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>43,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury Futures\n</td> <td>(16,928\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaptions\n</td> <td>1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td>(141,162\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>47,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(122,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net gains and losses on our derivatives include both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses include the net cash paid and received on our interest rate swaps during the period as well as sales and settlements of our Treasury Futures and swaptions. The realized loss on our derivative instruments is primarily a result of the pay fixed leg of our swaps carried at a higher interest rate than the receive floating leg of these same swaps, resulting in a net payment on the periodic settlement of the swaps during the year.\nUnrealized gains and losses include the change in market value, period over period, on our derivatives portfolio. Changes in market value are generally a result of changes in interest rates. We may or may not ultimately realize these unrealized derivative gains and losses depending on trade activity, changes in interest rates and the values of the underlying securities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized total net losses on derivatives of $123 million, compared to net gains on derivatives of $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized losses on interest rate swaps in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThere were no swap terminations during the year ended December 31, 2018. We paid $16 million to terminate interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Treasury futures positions remained unchanged at $620 million of notional value during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We reduced our swaptions by $338 million of notional value to $53 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to the $391 million notional value at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in our derivative positions were a result of changes in our portfolio composition and changes in interest rates.\nWe had net realized gains on our short futures positions of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and net realized losses of $4 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The realized gains and losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates during these periods, which affects the Treasury futures prices, resulting in realized gains or losses on our short futures positions. Treasury futures are not included in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income.\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nWe have elected the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in earnings for our IO MBS securities, certain Non-Agency RMBS securities which receive residual cash flows, Loans held for investment, and the related financing for the loans consolidated as a VIE in our statement of financial condition. In addition, we have elected to account for Agency MBS investments acquired on or after July 1, 2017 under the fair value option. All Agency MBS investments owned prior to July 1, 2017 will continue to be carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) as available-for-sale investments.\nIO MBS securities represent the right to receive the interest on a pool of mortgage backed securities, including both Agency and Non-Agency mortgage pools. The fair value of IO MBS securities are heavily impacted by changes in expected prepayment\nrates. When IO securities prepay faster than expectations, the holder of the IO security will receive less interest on the investment due to the reduced principal.\nWe invest in overcollateralization classes of several seasoned pools of mortgage loans. These holdings generally do not have a traditional original and current face or notional face value amount and pay cash based on guidance in the trust documents when excess cash is available. Many of these holdings do not pay any interest and may never pay interest. We have elected to carry these overcollateralization classes at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\nThe Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $47 million. The year to date 2018 gains on financial instruments at fair value were primarily driven by unrealized gains on Securitized debt collateralized by loans held for investment of $52 million and Non-Agency RMBS of $21 million, offset in part by unrealized losses on Loans held for investments of $27 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value were $111 million, which were primarily driven by unrealized gains on Loans held for investment of $206 million, offset in part by unrealized losses on Securitized debt collateralized by loans held for investment of $78 million.\nGains and Losses on Sales of Assets and Extinguishment of Securitized Debt\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had net realized losses of $3 million, net realized gains of $9 million and $18 million, respectively, on sales of investments. We do not forecast sales of investments as we generally expect to invest for long term gains. However, from time to time, we may sell assets to create liquidity necessary to pursue new opportunities, achieve targeted leverage ratios as well as for gains when prices indicate a sale is most beneficial to us, or is the most prudent course of action to maintain a targeted risk adjusted yield for our investors.\nWhen we acquire our outstanding securitized debt, we extinguish the outstanding debt and recognize a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the debt and the cost to acquire the debt which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThere were no securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS with an amortized cost balance of $166 thousand for $167 thousand. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1 thousand, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS with an amortized cost balance of $10 million for $11 million. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $355 thousand, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $861 million for $835 million. These transactions resulted in a net gain on the extinguishment of debt of $26 million, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $1.0 billion for $1.1 billion. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $35 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $609 million for $609 million. These transactions resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $122 thousand. This loss is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016. As our securitized debt is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings some of these losses were recognized during prior periods.\nCompensation, General and Administrative Expenses and Deal Expenses\nThe table below shows our total compensation and benefit expense, general and administrative, or G&A expenses, and deal expenses as compared to average total assets and average equity for the periods presented.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Compensation, G&A and Deal Expenses\n</td> <td>Total Compensation, G&A and Deal Expenses/Average Assets\n</td> <td>Total Compensation, G&A and Deal Expenses/Average Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Ratios have been annualized, dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompensation and benefit costs were $35 million, $30 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases in Compensation and benefit costs for each year were primarily driven by higher bonuses and stock based compensation.\nG&A expenses were $24 million, $18 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The G&A expenses are primarily comprised of auditing, information technology, legal and consulting expenses. The increases in G&A expenses during 2018, were primarily driven by higher legal expenses, due diligence fees and investment manager fees as compared to the same period of 2017. G&A expenses were relatively unchanged during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe Company incurred deal expenses of $8 million, $21 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in deal expenses year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by lower securitization activity compared to the same period of 2017. The deal expenses increased during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased securitization activity as during 2017.\nServicing Fees\nServicing fees expenses were $41 million, $42 million and $31 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These servicing fees are related to the consolidation of the whole loan securitization vehicles and are paid from interest income earned by the VIEs. The servicing fees range from 20 to 50 basis points of unpaid principal balances of our consolidated VIEs.\nCore earnings\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income excluding unrealized gains on the aggregate portfolio, impairment losses, realized gains on sales of investments, realized gains or losses on futures, realized gains or losses on swap terminations, gain on deconsolidation, extinguishment of debt and certain other non-recurring gains or losses. As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk and other expenses. Management believes that the presentation of core earnings provides investors with a useful measure to facilitate comparisons of financial performance between our REIT peers, but has important limitations. We believe core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions but is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides GAAP measures of net income and net income per basic share available to common stockholders for the periods presented and details with respect to reconciling the line items to core earnings and related per

The amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security is more favorable than previously estimated, a portion of the amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be transferred to accretable discount and accreted into interest income over time.

Our principal sources of capital and funds for additional investments primarily include earnings, principal paydowns and sales from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities including warehouse facilities, and proceeds from equity or other securities offerings. We also maintain a certain amount of liquid, un-levered securities that we can either finance with recourse or sell if we have liquidity needs.\nTo meet our short term (one year or less) liquidity needs, we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements and, subject to market conditions, other types of financing. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, as to repayment and margin requirements. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts or the percentage that is subtracted from the value of RMBS that collateralizes the financing, purchase price maintenance requirements, and requirements that all disputes related to the repurchase agreement be litigated or arbitrated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our lenders.\nBased on our current portfolio, leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements, we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term liquidity requirements. However, a decline in the value of our collateral could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns. If our cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell investments, potentially at a loss, issue debt or additional common or preferred equity securities.\nTo meet our longer term liquidity needs (greater than one year), we expect our principal sources of capital and funds to continue to be provided by earnings, principal paydowns and sales from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, as well as proceeds from equity or other securities offerings.\nIn addition to the principal sources of capital described above, we may enter into warehouse facilities and use longer dated structured repurchase agreements. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these facilities, and the investment opportunities available to us.\nCurrent Period\nWe held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $47 million, $64 million and $178 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities described below, our cash position decreased by $17 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nOur operating activities provided net cash of approximately $298 million, $487 million and $553 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cash provided by our operations is primarily due to interest received in excess of interest paid during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, interest received net of interest paid was $636 million, $580 million and $582 million, respectively.\nOur investing activities used cash of $6.0 billion, $4.3 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash for investment purchases of $9.7 billion, primarily Agency MBS and Loans held for investments. This cash used was offset in part by cash received for principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency RMBS, and Loans held for investments of $2.9 billion and sale of investments of $791 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased investments of $7.9 billion, primarily Loans held for investments. This cash used was offset in part by cash received for principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and securitized loans of $2.8 billion and investment sales of $749 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased investments of $6.1 billion, primarily Loans held for investments. The cash used was offset in part by cash received on sales of investments of $2.7 billion, primarily Agency RMBS, and principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and securitized loans of $2.2 billion.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $5.7 billion, $3.7 billion and $781 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received cash from net proceeds on our repurchase agreements of $6.8 billion, debt issuance of $1.8 billion, and Series C preferred stock offering of $252 million. These receipts of cash were offset in part by cash used for repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $2.7 billion, common and preferred dividends paid of $418 million, and repurchase of common stock of $15 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received cash of $5.2 billion from debt issuance, $1.6 billion from net proceeds received on repurchase agreements\nand $314 million from our Series B preferred stock offering. These receipts of cash provided were offset in part by repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $3.0 billion and common and preferred dividends paid of $412 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received cash of $4.8 billion on debt issuance. The cash provided was offset in part by net proceeds paid on repurchase agreements of $1.8 billion, repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $1.9 billion, and dividends paid of $454 million.\nOur recourse leverage was 3.8:1 and 2.0:1 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, respectively. Our recourse leverage excludes the securitized debt which can only be repaid from the proceeds on the assets securing this debt in their respective VIEs. Our recourse leverage is presented as a ratio of our repurchase agreements, which are recourse to our assets and our equity.\nWe believe that our cash balances and liquid Agency portfolio provides an appropriate level of liquidity. Even though we have unrestricted Agency MBS investments, we expect to meet our future cash needs primarily from principal and interest payments on our portfolio and do not anticipate the need to sell unrestricted Agency MBS investments to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to continue to finance our MBS portfolio largely through repurchase agreements and loans through the securitization market. In addition, we may from time to time sell securities, issue debt, or issue equity as a source of cash to fund new purchases.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 the remaining maturities on our RMBS and loan repurchase agreements were as follows.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overnight\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 to 29 days\n</td> <td>6,326,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,745,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 to 59 days\n</td> <td>4,620,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60 to 89 days\n</td> <td>1,504,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90 to 119 days\n</td> <td>169,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than or equal to 120 days\n</td> <td>1,409,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>705,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,250,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average remaining maturity of Repurchase agreements secured by:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>30 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency MBS and Loans held for investment\n</td> <td>231 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe collateralize the repurchase agreements we use to finance our operations with our MBS investments. Our counterparties negotiate a \u2018haircut', which is the difference expressed in percentage terms between the fair value of the collateral and the amount the counterparty will lend to us, when we enter into a financing transaction. The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with holding the MBS by the lender. The haircut provides lenders with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for a margin call to be issued or margin to be returned as normal daily increases or decreases in MBS market values occur. At December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 4.8% and 5.1%, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investments was 24.7% compared to 26.2% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average borrowing rates for our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 2.55% and Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investments was 4.04%. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average borrowing rates for our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 1.47% and Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investment was 3.41%, respectively.\nAs the fair value of the Non-Agency MBS is more difficult to determine, as well as more volatile period to period than Agency MBS, the Non-Agency MBS typically requires a larger haircut. In addition, when financing assets using standard form of SIFMA Master Repurchase Agreements, the counterparty to the agreement typically nets its exposure to us on all outstanding repurchase agreements and issues margin calls if movement of the fair values of the assets in the aggregate exceeds their allowable exposure to us. A decline in asset fair values could create a margin call, or may create no margin call depending on the counterparty's specific policy. In addition, counterparties consider a number of factors, including their aggregate exposure to us as a whole and the number of days remaining before the repurchase transaction closes prior to issuing a margin call. See\nNote 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on how we determine the fair values of the RMBS collateralizing our repurchase agreements.\nThe table below presents our average daily repurchase balance and the repurchase balance at each period end for the periods presented. Our balance at period-end tends to fluctuate from the average daily balances due to the adjusting of the size of our portfolio by using leverage. We continue to deploy capital for strategic purchases of investments.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>Average Repurchase Balance\n</td> <td>Repurchase Balance at Period End\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,816,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,324,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,250,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,482,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,600,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,082,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,235,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,143,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,527,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,127,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter End March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,257,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,202,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are not required to maintain any specific leverage ratio. We believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our total debt was approximately $22.6 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively, which represented a leverage ratio for both periods of approximately 6.1:1 and 4.6:1. We include our repurchase agreements and securitized debt in the numerator of our leverage ratio and stockholders' equity as the denominator.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had repurchase agreements with 30 counterparties. All of our repurchase agreements are secured by Agency, Non-Agency RMBS and Loans held for investments or, in limited circumstances, cash. Under these repurchase agreements we may not be able to reclaim our collateral but still be obligated to pay our repurchase obligations. We mitigate this risk by spreading our exposure to multiple counterparties, as well as ensuring our counterparties are highly rated. Therefore, we believe the risk of loss of our collateral posted is mitigated by the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $15.8 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, of securities pledged against our repurchase agreement obligations.\nAt December 31, 2018, our repurchase agreements have original maturities ranging from less than 30 days to 1,817 days and a weighted average original maturity of 135 days. We expect to renew most of our repurchase agreements at maturity. When we renew our repurchase agreements, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain as favorable an interest rate as a result of rising rates.\nWe offset the interest rate risk of our repurchase agreements primarily through the use of interest rate swaps, swaptions and treasury futures. The average remaining maturities on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 range from less than 1 year to 30 years and have a weighted average maturity of approximately 7 years. All of our swaps are cleared by a central clearing house. When our interest rate swaps are in a net loss position (expected cash payments are in excess of expected cash receipts on the swaps), we post collateral as required by the terms of our swap agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we have two swaption counterparties and two futures counterparties.\nExposure to Financial Counterparties\nWe actively manage the number of repurchase agreement counterparties. The following table summarizes our exposure to our repurchase agreement counterparties at December 31, 2018:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Country\n</td> <td>Number of Counterparties\n</td> <td>Repurchase Agreement Financing\n</td> <td>Interest Rate Swaps at Fair Value\n</td> <td>Exposure (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,528,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(118,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>2,557,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>1,921,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>870,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>596,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>590,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switzerland\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>514,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Korea\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>365,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>86,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(82,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,713,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the amount of securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and unrealized loss on swaps for each counterparty.\nOver the past several years, several large European financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large European banks or institutions. Some of these financial institutions or their U.S. subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions. We have entered into repurchase agreements or exchange cleared interest rate swaps with 6 counterparties as of December 31, 2018 that are either domiciled in Europe or is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a European-domiciled financial institution.\nIf the European credit volatility, including countries that may choose to leave the Euro zone as Britain has, continues to impact these major European financial institutions, it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their U.S. subsidiaries. Our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events. We monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions, financial relief plans, credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties. We make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps, or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary.\nAt December 31, 2018, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nStockholders' Equity\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors reauthorized $100 million under our share repurchase program, or the Repurchase Program. Such authorization does not have an expiration date and, at present, there is no intention to modify or otherwise rescind such authorization. Shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market, including through block purchases, through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Among other factors, we intend to only consider repurchasing shares of our common stock when the purchase price is less than the last publicly reported book value per common share. In addition, we do not intend to repurchase any shares from directors, officers or other affiliates. The program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases will be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases.\nPursuant to our Repurchase Program, during the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 883 thousand shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.81 per share for a total of $15 million. There were no other stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other than a de minimis amount issued under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and\nas discussed below under Restricted Stock Grants,\u201d we did not issue any common shares during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nIn September 2018, we issued 10,400,000 shares of 7.75% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Series C Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $25.00 per share and for net proceeds to us of $252 million. The Series C Preferred Stock is redeemable at $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) exclusively at our option commencing in September 30, 2025, subject to our right, under limited circumstances, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock prior to that date. The initial dividend rate for the Series C Preferred Stock, from and including September 20, 2018, to but not including September 30, 2025, will be equal to 7.75% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual rate of $1.9375 per share). On and after September 30, 2025, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will accumulate at a percentage of the $25.00 liquidation preference equal to an annual floating rate of the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.743% per annum. The Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, when and as declared, a dividend at a rate of 7.75% per year on the $25.00 liquidation preference before the common stock is paid any dividends and is senior to the common stock with respect to distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nWe declared dividends to Series A preferred stockholders of $12 million, or $2.00 per preferred share, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe declared dividends to Series B preferred stockholders of $26 million and $22 million, or $2.00 and $1.68 per preferred share, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe declared dividends to Series C preferred stock holders of $6 million, or $0.54 per preferred share during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRestricted Stock Unit Grants\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted certain of our employees and directors Restricted Stock Units, or RSU awards. RSU awards are designed to reward our employees for services provided over the previous year. Generally, the RSU awards vest equally over a three-year period beginning from the grant date and will fully vest after three years. The RSU awards are valued at the market price of our common stock on the grant date and the employees must be employed by us on the vesting dates to receive the RSU awards. We granted 335 thousand and 204 thousand RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, with a grant date fair value of $6 million and $4 million, respectively, which will be recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted certain employees 133 thousand and 144 thousand Performance Share Units, or PSU awards, respectively. PSU awards are designed to align compensation with our future performance. The PSU awards include a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The final number of shares that will vest will be between 0% to 150% of the total PSU awards granted based on our total shareholder return as compared to an index of comparable financial institutions and will cliff vest at the end of the performance period. The PSU awards are measured at fair value on the grant date which will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year vesting period. Fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model developed to value the specific features of the PSU awards, including market based conditions. Inputs into the model include our historical volatility, the peer average historical volatility, and the correlation coefficient of the volatility. In addition, inputs also included the share price at the beginning of the measurement period and an estimated total shareholder return for both us and the peer group of comparable financial institutions. Based on the model results, the 133 thousand PSU awards granted during 2018 had a grant date value of $2 million that will cliff vest on December 31, 2020. The 144 thousand PSU awards granted during 2017 had a grant date value of $3 million which will cliff vest on December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were approximately 1.2 million and 770 thousand unvested shares of restricted stock units issued to our employees, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The estimated principal repayment schedule of the securitized debt is based on expected cash flows of the residential mortgage loans or RMBS, as adjusted for expected principal writedowns on the underlying collateral of the debt.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Within One Year\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>Greater Than or Equal to Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,521,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,030,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>23,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt at fair value, collateralized by loans held for investment\n</td> <td>1,608,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,587,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,949,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,237,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,382,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on RMBS repurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td>85,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on securitized debt (1)\n</td> <td>372,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,652,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,612,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,413,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,529,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,663,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,218,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Within One Year\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>Greater Than or Equal to Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,903,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,250,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>42,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt at fair value, collateralized by loans held for investment\n</td> <td>1,819,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,872,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,140,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,439,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,271,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on RMBS repurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td>30,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on securitized debt (1)\n</td> <td>392,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,187,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,873,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,525,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,917,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,503,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nNot included in the table above are the unfunded construction loan commitments of $1.1 billion and $567 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which will primarily be paid within one year of reported periods and are reported under Payables for investments purchased in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nWe have made a $25 thousand investment to acquire 24.9% ownership interest in KAH Capital through one of our taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition to the investment in KAH Capital, we have made a $150 million capital commitment to Hains Point (Hains Point), which is KAH Capital's initial fund for which we are the sole investor. KAH Capital will manage the investments in Hains Point including asset selection, repurchase and other financing arrangements as well as hedging transactions. Capital calls for investments made in Hains Point are subject to our consent and approval. We expect that KAH Capital will earn $6.5 million over approximately 3 years for its investment advisory services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nDividends\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Before we pay any dividend, we must first meet any operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our financing facilities and other debt payable.\nInflation\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our Board of Directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and financial condition are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies and accounting estimates are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are described in this section. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires management to make assumptions or judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made or require significant management judgment in interpreting the accounting literature. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, or other accounting judgments were made, this could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These critical accounting policies were developed by management, and reviewed by our auditors, prior to being presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe consolidated financial statements include, on a consolidated basis, our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including OTTI of Non-Agency RMBS, valuation of Loans held for investments, Agency and Non-Agency RMBS and interest rate swaps and income recognition on Loans held for investments and Non-Agency RMBS. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nInterest Income and Impairment on Non-Agency and Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nWe invest in RMBS representing interests in obligations backed by pools of residential mortgage loans. We delineate between (1) Agency RMBS and (2) Non-Agency RMBS as follows: The Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, and other RMBS representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of residential mortgage loans issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest repayment by agencies of the U.S. Government or federally chartered corporations such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Non-Agency RMBS are not issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and are therefore subject to credit risk.\nWe hold certain of our RMBS as available-for-sale, record these investments at estimated fair value as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, and include unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in Other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unrealized gains and losses on RMBS investments for which we have elected fair value option, are included in Net unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, as part of the overall management of our portfolio, we may sell any of our RMBS investments and recognize a realized gain or loss as a component of earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations utilizing the average method.\nOur accounting policies for recognition of interest income and OTTI related to RMBS are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As noted therein, there are three different accounting models that may be applicable for purposes of the recognition of interest income and OTTI on RMBS, and include the following:\nASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (ASC 310-20) - applies to certain Agency MBS and certain Non-Agency RMBS of high credit quality that, at the time of purchase, we expect to collect all contractual cash flows and the security cannot be contractually prepaid in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30) - applies to Non-Agency RMBS where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality and we do not expect to collect all contractual cash flows of the security.\nASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (ASC 325-40) - applies to certain Non-Agency RMBS and Agency MBS for which we have elected fair value option and are not within the scope of ASC 310-20 or ASC 310-30. These include Non-Agency RMBS which is not of high credit quality at the time of purchase or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nThe determination of which accounting model to apply will have a significant impact on the amounts of interest income and OTTI losses reflected in the results of operations because each accounting model has different requirements regarding the cash flows used to calculate interest income and impairments (i.e., contractual cash flows vs. expected cash flows) and the manner of such calculations, and the impact of changes in prepayment assumptions on interest income or OTTI losses.\nFor Agency and Non-Agency MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20, the amount of interest income recorded over the life of a security will be equal to the contractual cash flows of the security and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discount or premium. The amount of interest income reported in any particular financial reporting period will, however, vary depending on the actual and estimated prepayments on the security. For Agency MBS purchased at a premium to the principal amount, increases in prepayment speeds will generally result in a reduction of the recorded amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period whereas decreases in prepayment speeds will generally result in an increase in the amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period. The opposite is generally the case for Agency MBS purchased at a discount to the principal amount. That is, as prepayment speeds increase, interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally increase, whereas interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally decrease when prepayment speeds decline. However, volatility in the reported amount of interest income will result when there are significant changes in actual or future expected prepayment speeds regardless of the direction of those changes. This volatility is because the accounting model that we apply under ASC 310-20 requires us to record a cumulative adjustment, on a retrospective basis from the acquisition date of the security, when there are changes in prepayment speeds. That cumulative adjustment at each reporting date is intended to reflect the most current estimate of the timing of prepayments over the life of the security (both actual prepayments that have occurred in the past and the timing of prepayments that will occur in the future).\nAgency MBS and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20 may experience an OTTI loss. The OTTI loss recognized in earnings will be calculated based on the present value of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to recognition of an OTTI loss, we recognize income on these securities under ASC 310-30 as further described below.\nFor Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40, the reported amounts of interest income and OTTI are significantly impacted by management judgments around both the amount and timing of credit losses (defaults) and prepayments. Interest income on these Non-Agency RMBS is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. Furthermore, the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments also impacts the amount of OTTI losses recognized in earnings.\nNon-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40 is generally purchased at a discount to the principal amount. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calculate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Depending on the nature of the changes in the timing or amount of cash flows expected to be collected, whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayment assumptions, the following will occur:\n \u2022 If there is a positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, the effective interest rate in future accounting periods may increase resulting in an increase in the reported amount of interest income in future periods. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes must be considered significant for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 for the effective interest rate in future accounting periods to increase. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has increased from the previous estimate. This can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from reductions in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, a positive change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the positive impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the negative impact of increased defaults, or when the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults exceeds the negative impact of an extension of the timing of receipt of cash flows. \n \u2022 If there is a negative (or adverse) change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, and the securities' fair value is below its amortized cost, an OTTI loss equal to the adverse change in cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the securities' effective rate before impairment, is required to be recorded in current period earnings. For Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in future periods will decline because of the reduced balance of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. \nAdditionally, for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 325-40, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income during the period directly after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in such future period will decline, absent an increase in cash flows expected to be collected, because of the reduced amount of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. An adverse change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has decreased from the most previous estimate. This change can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from increases in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, an adverse change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the negative impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults, or when the negative impact of an increase in estimated defaults exceeds the positive impact of a shortening of the timing of receipt of cash flows.\nThe accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 are impacted by both assumptions of prepayments and assumptions of credit losses (defaults) and, accordingly, changes in the amounts of recorded interest income or OTTI losses over financial reporting periods cannot be considered to result solely from the impact of changes in the credit profile of the investment or solely from the impact of changes in prepayment speeds. Furthermore, while there may be some level of correlation between assumptions for defaults and prepayments as general market interest rates change, in the recent market conditions that correlation has not been direct or predictable.\nInterest Income on Loans held for investments at fair value\nInterest income on Loans held for investments at fair value is accounted for under ASC 325-40. Interest income on these Loans held for investments at fair value is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calculate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected.\nDetermination of appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS is dependent on management's assessment and judgment related to the following factors made as of the acquisition date:\n \u2022 Our assessment of the credit quality of the asset, including its credit rating at the acquisition date and whether the security has experienced deterioration in credit quality since its inception. \n \u2022 Our assessment of the probability of collection of all contractual cash flows. \n \u2022 Our assessment of whether the security can be contractually prepaid such that we would not recover our initial investment. \nThe most critical judgment inherent in the determination of the appropriate accounting model is our assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. In making this accounting judgment, we consider expected defaults and prepayments as further described below.\nImpact of prepayment assumptions on MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20\nChanges in actual prepayments will impact the amount of interest income recognized in each financial reporting period for MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20. We estimate expected prepayment as further described below.\nImpact of default and prepayment assumptions on Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40\nIn determining the OTTI related to credit losses for Non-Agency RMBS securities accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows is the effective interest rate or effective yield used for income recognition purposes.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. For VIEs' that do not have substantial on-going activities, the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance may be determined by an entity's involvement with the design of the VIE.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition contain the assets and liabilities related to twenty-nine consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs. Due to the non-recourse nature of these VIEs our net exposure to loss from investments in these entities is limited to our retained beneficial interests.\nAt December 31, 2018, we consolidated twenty-five residential mortgage loan securitizations and four RMBS re-securitization transactions which are VIEs. The residential mortgage loan securitizations contain jumbo prime and sub prime residential mortgage loans. The RMBS re-securitization transactions contain Non-Agency RMBS comprised of primarily what we classify as collateral backed by Alt-A first lien mortgages of 2005-2007 vintages. We categorize collateral as Alt-A regardless of whether the loans were originally described as prime\u201d if the behavior of the collateral when we purchased the security more resembles typical Alt-A collateral. We define Alt-A collateral characteristics to be evidenced by the 60+ day delinquency bucket of the pool being greater than 5% and the weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination as greater than 650.\nOur determination to consolidate these twenty-nine VIEs was significantly influenced by management's judgment related to the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the identification of the party with the power over such activities. For the residential mortgage loan securitizations, we determined that our ability to direct the servicer resulted in us having the power that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE. For the four consolidated RMBS re-securitization transactions, we determined that no party has power over any ongoing activities of the entities and therefore the determination of the primary beneficiary should be based on involvement with the initial design of the entity. Since we transferred the RMBS to the securitization entities, we determined we had the power over the design of the entity, which resulted in us being considered the primary beneficiary. This determination was influenced by the amount of economic exposure to the financial performance of the entity and required a significant management judgment in determining that we should consolidate these four entities.\nDue to the consolidation of these VIEs, our actual ownership interests in the securitization and re-securitizations have been eliminated in consolidation and the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect both the assets held and non-recourse debt issued to third parties by these VIEs. In addition, our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts\nrelated to the assets and liabilities of the VIEs as opposed to the actual economic interests we own in these VIEs. Our interest in these VIEs is restricted to the beneficial interests we retained in these transactions. We are not obligated to provide any financial support to these VIEs.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition separately present: (i) our direct assets and liabilities, and (ii) the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. Assets of all consolidated VIEs can only be used to satisfy the obligations of those VIEs, and the liabilities of consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.\nWe have aggregated all the assets and liabilities of the consolidated securitization vehicles due to our determination that these entities are substantively similar and therefore a further disaggregated presentation would not be more meaningful. The notes to our consolidated financial statements describe our direct assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our investments in VIEs.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. Specifically, this guidance defines fair value based on exit price, or the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for RMBS are based on models that consider the estimated cash flows expected to be collected from the underlying collateral and an estimated market-based yield reflective of the unique attributes of the tranche including, but not limited to, assumptions related to prepayment speeds, the frequency and severity of defaults and attributes of the collateral underlying such securities. Estimates of the fair value of RMBS are particularly sensitive to assumptions related to the expected timing of prepayments, the extent of defaults, and the severity of expected losses. Management reviews the fair values generated by the model to determine whether prices are reflective of the current market. Management indirectly corroborates its estimates of the fair value using pricing models by comparing its results to independent prices provided by third party pricing services.\nTo the extent the inputs used to estimate fair value are observable, the values would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise they would be categorized as Level 3. The Company's fair value estimation process utilizes inputs other than quoted prices that are observed in the market. The Company's estimate of prepayment, default and severity curves all involve adjustments that are deemed to be significant to the fair value measurement process, which renders the resulting Non-Agency fair value estimates Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets represent approximately 55% and 79% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represent approximately 98% and 100% of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2(o) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company or expected to be adopted by the Company in the future.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of this 2018 Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this 2018 Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a publicly traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is primarily engaged in the business of investing directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, and other real estate related securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nWe focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring residential mortgage loans and on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. At December 31, 2018, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 47% of our investment portfolio was residential mortgage loans, 47% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS and 6% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, respectively. At December 31, 2017, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 67% of our investment portfolio was residential mortgage loans, 22% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS and 11% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, respectively.\nOur investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. During 2018, we saw an increase in the relative value of Agency MBS over the residential mortgage loans and shifted our asset mix significantly in favor of Agency MBS as compared to 2017. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and preserve capital throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term.\nWe use leverage to increase returns and to finance the acquisition of our assets. Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We expect to finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, securitizations, warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, structured asset financing and offerings of our securities. We may manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources.\nMarket Conditions and our Strategy\nThere are several key factors that impact our financial results, including the interest rate environment and changes in LIBOR rates, U.S. unemployment rates and residential home prices, as well as residential mortgage origination and refinance activity. The interest rate environment is sensitive to actual and anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve actions, availability of adequate and efficient financing sources, rate volatility as well as other market factors. We have operated over the past several years and continue to operate in a volatile interest rate environment.\nFinancial results were mixed in 2018 as the S&P 500 experienced gains early in 2018 following the trends of 2016 and 2017. The S&P 500 declined in late January but then generally rebounded through September before falling from that point through the end of the year. Overall the S&P lost 6% in 2018, snapping a multi-year streak of gains. The Federal Reserve continued its plan of increasing short term rates, increasing the Fed Funds Target rate four times in 2018 with hikes in March, June, September and December. Longer-term interest rates generally increased during the year, with the 10-year Treasury hitting peaks in October and November before falling to the end of the year. Overall, the short end of the yield curve was up approximately 100 basis points driven by the four rate hikes while the 10-year Treasury was up only 28 basis points, creating a flattening of the yield curve.\nThe Case-Shiller housing index showed continued strength but the pace of growth started to slow down after the first quarter of 2018. U.S. mortgage rates trended up for most of the year before slipping in November and most of December. The rate of unemployment continues to be historically low, which is generally supportive of the U.S. housing economy.\nIn 2018, we added approximately $6.9 billion of Agency pass throughs, $943 million of Agency CMBS and $1.7 billion of Loans held for investments. To finance these acquisitions, we added approximately $6.8 billion of repurchase agreements and $1.8 billion of securitized debt.\nWhile the interest rate environment and investor demand was supportive of the value of the assets in our portfolio during 2018, the increase in short-term rates increased our economic interest expense and the cost to finance our portfolio. We added to our interest earning assets in 2018, growing from an average of $18.0 billion in 2017 to $21.8 billion in 2018 and reduced the asset yield by 50 basis points as our asset mix was shifted to lower yielding Agency MBS. Our average interest-bearing liabilities are up from $15.5 billion in 2017 to $18.9 billion in 2018 and economic borrowing costs are up approximately 10 basis points.\nOur book value per common share was $15.90 as of December 31, 2018 down from $16.85 as of December 31, 2017 as year-end interest rate declines caused losses in our hedge portfolio. Given the economic environment, we continue to seek high yielding investment opportunities that will deliver a durable dividend to our shareholders while managing risk.\nBusiness Operations\nNet Income Summary\nThe table below presents our net income on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\n(1) Includes interest income of consolidated VIEs of $904,830, $914,022 and $678,623 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. See Note 8 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n(2) Includes interest expense of consolidated VIEs of $395,255, $390,858 and $249,708 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 8 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOur primary source of income is interest income earned on our assets, net of interest expense paid on our financing liabilities.\nOur net income available to common shareholders decreased by $123 million to $368 million, or $1.97 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $491 million, or $2.62 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to an increase in Net losses on derivatives of $129 million, and a decrease in Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value of $65 million, which was offset in part by an increase in Gains on extinguishment of debt of $62 million and a decrease in other than temporary impairment losses of $40 million, compared to the same period of, 2017.\nOur net income available to common shareholders decreased by $58 million to $491 million, or $2.62 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $549 million, or $2.93 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in other income of $95 million, which was a one-time receipt of additional remedies against other parties in the first quarter of 2016, an increase in losses on debt extinguishment of $35 million and an increase in preferred stock dividends of $31 million. These decreases to net income were offset in part by an increase in unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value of $52 million and an increase in unrealized gains on derivatives of $44 million, compared to the same period of 2016.\nInterest Income\nThe changes in our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017, are primarily driven by the repositioning of our balance sheet by significantly increasing Agency MBS investments.\nInterest income increased by $135 million, or 12%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.1 billion for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on Agency MBS of $135 million and Loans held for investments of $51 million, which was driven by higher average Agency MBS and Loan held for investment balances, as compared to the same period of 2017. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in interest income on Non-Agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs of $48 million, compared to the same period of 2017.\nInterest income increased by $205 million, or 22%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $934 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on residential mortgage loans of $260 million as compared to the same period of 2016. This increase was offset in part by lower interest income on our Agency MBS of $30 million and Non-agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs of $18 million, compared to the same period of 2016, as in 2017, we reduced our Agency MBS and Non-agency RMBS investments from 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $146 million, or 27%, to $679 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $533 million for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses on repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS of $85 million, repurchase agreements collateralized by RMBS from loan securitization of $38 million and securitized debt, collateralized by loans of $13 million, compared to the same period of 2017. Interest expense is also higher as a result of higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017. LIBOR rates have increased during the year ended 2018 following the increases in the Federal funds rate in March 2018, June 2018, September 2018 and December 2018. Interest expense for GAAP reporting does not include the periodic costs of our derivatives, which are reported separately in our GAAP financial statements.\nInterest expense increased by $185 million, or 53%, to $533 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $348 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased interest expense on securitized debt, collateralized by seasoned subprime residential mortgage loans of $143 million and repurchase agreements collateralized by RMBS from loan securitization of $41 million, which were driven primarily by higher securitized debt and repurchase agreements collateralized by loan balances compared to the same period of 2016. Interest expense is also higher in 2017 as a result of higher interest rates compared to 2016. LIBOR rates increased during the year ended 2017 following the increases in the Federal fund rate in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017 and December 2017.\nEconomic Net Interest Income\nOur Economic net interest income\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure, that equals interest income, less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate swaps. Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Net realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. However, Economic net interest income should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nThe following table reconciles the Economic net interest income to GAAP Net interest income for the periods presented.\n\n(1) Primarily interest expense/(income) on cash and cash equivalents.\nNet Interest Rate Spread\nThe following table shows our average earning assets held, interest earned on assets, yield on average interest earning assets, average debt balance, economic interest expense, economic average cost of funds, economic net interest income, and net interest rate spread for the periods presented.\n\n\nEconomic Net Interest Income and the Average Earning Assets\nOur economic net interest income increased by $4 million to $593 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $589 million for the same period of 2017. Our net interest rate spread, which equals the yield on our average interest-earning assets less the economic average cost of funds decreased by 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. The net interest margin, which equals the economic net interest income as a percentage of the net average balance of our interest-earning assets less our interest-bearing liabilities also decreased by 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Average net interest-earning assets increased by $450 million to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. This increase in average net interest-earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in our average investments in Agency MBS and residential mortgage loans, which was partially offset by an increase in our repurchase agreements.\nEconomic Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nThe borrowing rate at which we are able to finance our assets using repurchase agreements and securitized debt is typically correlated to LIBOR and the term of the financing. The table below shows our average borrowed funds, economic interest expense, average cost of funds (inclusive of realized losses on interest rate swaps), average one-month LIBOR, average three-month LIBOR and average one-month LIBOR relative to average three-month LIBOR.\n\n(1) Includes effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Economic interest expense increased by $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and economic interest expense is a result of the increase in the amount of our repurchase agreements as well as the increase in LIBOR.\nAverage one-month and three-month LIBOR were up 91 basis points and 104 basis points, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017, contributing to the increase in economic interest expense. While we do acquire interest rate hedges to mitigate changes in interest rate risks, the hedges may not fully offset interest expense movements.\nNet Other-than-temporary Credit Impairment Losses\nOTTI losses are generated when fair values decline below our amortized cost basis, an unrealized loss, and the expected future cash flows decline from prior periods, an adverse change. When an unrealized loss and an adverse change in cash flows occur, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings. In addition, if we intend to sell a security, or believe we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the unrealized loss.\nOTTI losses were $22 million, $62 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of these amounts, $19 million, $53 million and $39 million of the OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were related to securities included in our consolidated VIEs. As of December 31, 2018, we had three Non-agency RMBS securities subject to OTTI in an unrealized loss position totaling $513 thousand for which we did not recognize impairment. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio and will record an OTTI for all investments in an unrealized loss position for which we do not believe we will recover our amortized cost prior to maturity or sale.\nNet Gains (losses) on derivatives\nOur interest rate swaps are primarily used to economically hedge the effects of changes in interest rates on our portfolio, specifically our floating rate debt. Therefore, we included the periodic interest costs of the interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on these economic hedges in our presentation of economic net interest income and our net interest spreads. As we do not account for these as hedges for GAAP presentation, we present these gains and losses separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease in the net periodic interest cost of the interest rate swaps are primarily due to the increase in interest rates and changes in our swap portfolio balance during the year.\nThe table below shows a summary of our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nThe net gains and losses on our derivatives include both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses include the net cash paid and received on our interest rate swaps during the period as well as sales and settlements of our Treasury Futures and swaptions. The realized loss on our derivative instruments is primarily a result of the pay fixed leg of our swaps carried at a higher interest rate than the receive floating leg of these same swaps, resulting in a net payment on the periodic settlement of the swaps during the year.\nUnrealized gains and losses include the change in market value, period over period, on our derivatives portfolio. Changes in market value are generally a result of changes in interest rates. We may or may not ultimately realize these unrealized derivative gains and losses depending on trade activity, changes in interest rates and the values of the underlying securities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized total net losses on derivatives of $123 million, compared to net gains on derivatives of $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized losses on interest rate swaps in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThere were no swap terminations during the year ended December 31, 2018. We paid $16 million to terminate interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Treasury futures positions remained unchanged at $620 million of notional value during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We reduced our swaptions by $338 million of notional value to $53 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to the $391 million notional value at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in our derivative positions were a result of changes in our portfolio composition and changes in interest rates.\nWe had net realized gains on our short futures positions of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and net realized losses of $4 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The realized gains and losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates during these periods, which affects the Treasury futures prices, resulting in realized gains or losses on our short futures positions. Treasury futures are not included in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income.\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nWe have elected the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in earnings for our IO MBS securities, certain Non-Agency RMBS securities which receive residual cash flows, Loans held for investment, and the related financing for the loans consolidated as a VIE in our statement of financial condition. In addition, we have elected to account for Agency MBS investments acquired on or after July 1, 2017 under the fair value option. All Agency MBS investments owned prior to July 1, 2017 will continue to be carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) as available-for-sale investments.\nIO MBS securities represent the right to receive the interest on a pool of mortgage backed securities, including both Agency and Non-Agency mortgage pools. The fair value of IO MBS securities are heavily impacted by changes in expected prepayment\nrates. When IO securities prepay faster than expectations, the holder of the IO security will receive less interest on the investment due to the reduced principal.\nWe invest in overcollateralization classes of several seasoned pools of mortgage loans. These holdings generally do not have a traditional original and current face or notional face value amount and pay cash based on guidance in the trust documents when excess cash is available. Many of these holdings do not pay any interest and may never pay interest. We have elected to carry these overcollateralization classes at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\nThe Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $47 million. The year to date 2018 gains on financial instruments at fair value were primarily driven by unrealized gains on Securitized debt collateralized by loans held for investment of $52 million and Non-Agency RMBS of $21 million, offset in part by unrealized losses on Loans held for investments of $27 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Net unrealized gains on financial instruments at fair value were $111 million, which were primarily driven by unrealized gains on Loans held for investment of $206 million, offset in part by unrealized losses on Securitized debt collateralized by loans held for investment of $78 million.\nGains and Losses on Sales of Assets and Extinguishment of Securitized Debt\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had net realized losses of $3 million, net realized gains of $9 million and $18 million, respectively, on sales of investments. We do not forecast sales of investments as we generally expect to invest for long term gains. However, from time to time, we may sell assets to create liquidity necessary to pursue new opportunities, achieve targeted leverage ratios as well as for gains when prices indicate a sale is most beneficial to us, or is the most prudent course of action to maintain a targeted risk adjusted yield for our investors.\nWhen we acquire our outstanding securitized debt, we extinguish the outstanding debt and recognize a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the debt and the cost to acquire the debt which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThere were no securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS with an amortized cost balance of $166 thousand for $167 thousand. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1 thousand, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS with an amortized cost balance of $10 million for $11 million. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $355 thousand, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $861 million for $835 million. These transactions resulted in a net gain on the extinguishment of debt of $26 million, which is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $1.0 billion for $1.1 billion. This transaction resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $35 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired securitized debt collateralized by loans with an amortized cost balance of $609 million for $609 million. These transactions resulted in a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $122 thousand. This loss is reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016. As our securitized debt is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings some of these losses were recognized during prior periods.\nCompensation, General and Administrative Expenses and Deal Expenses\nThe table below shows our total compensation and benefit expense, general and administrative, or G&A expenses, and deal expenses as compared to average total assets and average equity for the periods presented.\n\nCompensation and benefit costs were $35 million, $30 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases in Compensation and benefit costs for each year were primarily driven by higher bonuses and stock based compensation.\nG&A expenses were $24 million, $18 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The G&A expenses are primarily comprised of auditing, information technology, legal and consulting expenses. The increases in G&A expenses during 2018, were primarily driven by higher legal expenses, due diligence fees and investment manager fees as compared to the same period of 2017. G&A expenses were relatively unchanged during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe Company incurred deal expenses of $8 million, $21 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in deal expenses year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by lower securitization activity compared to the same period of 2017. The deal expenses increased during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased securitization activity as during 2017.\nServicing Fees\nServicing fees expenses were $41 million, $42 million and $31 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These servicing fees are related to the consolidation of the whole loan securitization vehicles and are paid from interest income earned by the VIEs. The servicing fees range from 20 to 50 basis points of unpaid principal balances of our consolidated VIEs.\nCore earnings\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income excluding unrealized gains on the aggregate portfolio, impairment losses, realized gains on sales of investments, realized gains or losses on futures, realized gains or losses on swap terminations, gain on deconsolidation, extinguishment of debt and certain other non-recurring gains or losses. As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk and other expenses. Management believes that the presentation of core earnings provides investors with a useful measure to facilitate comparisons of financial performance between our REIT peers, but has important limitations. We believe core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions but is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides GAAP measures of net income and net income per basic share available to common stockholders for the periods presented and details with respect to reconciling the line items to core earnings and related per average basic common share amounts:\n\n\nOur core earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $440 million, or $2.35 per average basic common share, which remained relatively unchanged compared to $440 million, or $2.34 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Income (Loss) and Return on Total Stockholders' Equity\nThe table below shows our Net Income, Economic Net Interest Income and Core Earnings, each as a percentage of average stockholders' equity. Return on average equity is defined as our GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of average equity. Average equity is defined as the average of our beginning and ending stockholders' equity balance for the period reported. Economic Net Interest Income and Core Earnings are non-GAAP measures as defined in previous sections.\n\n* Includes effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\nReturn on average equity decreased by 392 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017. Economic net interest income as a percentage of average equity decreased by 87 basis points, driven primarily by higher interest expense related to the increase in LIBOR rates. Core earnings as a percentage of average equity decreased by 74 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily driven by a higher average equity balance due to preferred stock issuance.\nFinancial Condition\nPortfolio Review\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, on an aggregate basis, we purchased $9.7 billion of investments, sold $791 million of investments and received $2.9 billion in principal payments related to our Agency, Non-Agency RMBS and Loans held for investments portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our portfolio at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\n\n(1) Excludes cash and cash equivalents.\nGAAP leverage at period-end is calculated as a ratio of our repurchase agreements and securitized debt liabilities over GAAP book value. GAAP recourse leverage is calculated as a ratio of our repurchase agreements over GAAP book value.\nThe following table presents details of each asset class in our portfolio at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The principal or notional value represents the interest income earning balance of each class. The weighted average figures are weighted by each investment's respective principal/notional value in the asset class.\n\n(1) Bond Equivalent Yield at period end. Weighted Average Yield is calculated using each investment's respective amortized cost.\n(2) Calculated based on reported losses to date, utilizing widest data set available (i.e., life-time losses, 12-month loss, etc.)\n\n(1) Bond Equivalent Yield at period end. Weighted Average Yield is calculated using each investment's respective amortized cost.\n(2) Calculated based on reported losses to date, utilizing widest data set available (i.e., life-time losses, 12-month loss, etc.)\nBased on the projected cash flows for our Non-Agency RMBS that are not of high credit quality, a portion of the original purchase discount is designated as Accretable Discount, which reflects the purchase discount expected to be accreted into interest income, and a portion is designated as Non-Accretable Difference, which represents the contractual principal on the security that is not expected to be collected. The amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security is more favorable than previously estimated, a portion of the amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be transferred to accretable discount and accreted into interest income over time. Conversely, if the performance of a security is less favorable than previously estimated, an OTTI may be recognized resulting in an increase in the amounts designated as Non-Accretable Difference.\nThe following table presents changes to Accretable Discount (net of premiums) as it pertains to our Non-Agency RMBS portfolio, excluding premiums on IOs, during the previous five quarters.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay our borrowings, purchase RMBS, residential mortgage loans and other assets for our portfolio, pay dividends and other general business needs. Our principal sources of capital and funds for additional investments primarily include earnings, principal paydowns and sales from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities including warehouse facilities, and proceeds from equity or other securities offerings. We also maintain a certain amount of liquid, un-levered securities that we can either finance with recourse or sell if we have liquidity needs.\nTo meet our short term (one year or less) liquidity needs, we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements and, subject to market conditions, other types of financing. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, as to repayment and margin requirements. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts or the percentage that is subtracted from the value of RMBS that collateralizes the financing, purchase price maintenance requirements, and requirements that all disputes related to the repurchase agreement be litigated or arbitrated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our lenders.\nBased on our current portfolio, leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements, we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term liquidity requirements. However, a decline in the value of our collateral could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns. If our cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell investments, potentially at a loss, issue debt or additional common or preferred equity securities.\nTo meet our longer term liquidity needs (greater than one year), we expect our principal sources of capital and funds to continue to be provided by earnings, principal paydowns and sales from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, as well as proceeds from equity or other securities offerings.\nIn addition to the principal sources of capital described above, we may enter into warehouse facilities and use longer dated structured repurchase agreements. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these facilities, and the investment opportunities available to us.\nCurrent Period\nWe held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $47 million, $64 million and $178 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities described below, our cash position decreased by $17 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nOur operating activities provided net cash of approximately $298 million, $487 million and $553 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cash provided by our operations is primarily due to interest received in excess of interest paid during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, interest received net of interest paid was $636 million, $580 million and $582 million, respectively.\nOur investing activities used cash of $6.0 billion, $4.3 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash for investment purchases of $9.7 billion, primarily Agency MBS and Loans held for investments. This cash used was offset in part by cash received for principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency RMBS, and Loans held for investments of $2.9 billion and sale of investments of $791 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased investments of $7.9 billion, primarily Loans held for investments. This cash used was offset in part by cash received for principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and securitized loans of $2.8 billion and investment sales of $749 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased investments of $6.1 billion, primarily Loans held for investments. The cash used was offset in part by cash received on sales of investments of $2.7 billion, primarily Agency RMBS, and principal repayments on our Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and securitized loans of $2.2 billion.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $5.7 billion, $3.7 billion and $781 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received cash from net proceeds on our repurchase agreements of $6.8 billion, debt issuance of $1.8 billion, and Series C preferred stock offering of $252 million. These receipts of cash were offset in part by cash used for repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $2.7 billion, common and preferred dividends paid of $418 million, and repurchase of common stock of $15 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received cash of $5.2 billion from debt issuance, $1.6 billion from net proceeds received on repurchase agreements\nand $314 million from our Series B preferred stock offering. These receipts of cash provided were offset in part by repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $3.0 billion and common and preferred dividends paid of $412 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received cash of $4.8 billion on debt issuance. The cash provided was offset in part by net proceeds paid on repurchase agreements of $1.8 billion, repayment of principal on our securitized debt of $1.9 billion, and dividends paid of $454 million.\nOur recourse leverage was 3.8:1 and 2.0:1 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, respectively. Our recourse leverage excludes the securitized debt which can only be repaid from the proceeds on the assets securing this debt in their respective VIEs. Our recourse leverage is presented as a ratio of our repurchase agreements, which are recourse to our assets and our equity.\nWe believe that our cash balances and liquid Agency portfolio provides an appropriate level of liquidity. Even though we have unrestricted Agency MBS investments, we expect to meet our future cash needs primarily from principal and interest payments on our portfolio and do not anticipate the need to sell unrestricted Agency MBS investments to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to continue to finance our MBS portfolio largely through repurchase agreements and loans through the securitization market. In addition, we may from time to time sell securities, issue debt, or issue equity as a source of cash to fund new purchases.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 the remaining maturities on our RMBS and loan repurchase agreements were as follows.\n\nWe collateralize the repurchase agreements we use to finance our operations with our MBS investments. Our counterparties negotiate a \u2018haircut', which is the difference expressed in percentage terms between the fair value of the collateral and the amount the counterparty will lend to us, when we enter into a financing transaction. The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with holding the MBS by the lender. The haircut provides lenders with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for a margin call to be issued or margin to be returned as normal daily increases or decreases in MBS market values occur. At December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 4.8% and 5.1%, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investments was 24.7% compared to 26.2% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average borrowing rates for our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 2.55% and Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investments was 4.04%. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average borrowing rates for our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 1.47% and Non-Agency MBS and Loans held for investment was 3.41%, respectively.\nAs the fair value of the Non-Agency MBS is more difficult to determine, as well as more volatile period to period than Agency MBS, the Non-Agency MBS typically requires a larger haircut. In addition, when financing assets using standard form of SIFMA Master Repurchase Agreements, the counterparty to the agreement typically nets its exposure to us on all outstanding repurchase agreements and issues margin calls if movement of the fair values of the assets in the aggregate exceeds their allowable exposure to us. A decline in asset fair values could create a margin call, or may create no margin call depending on the counterparty's specific policy. In addition, counterparties consider a number of factors, including their aggregate exposure to us as a whole and the number of days remaining before the repurchase transaction closes prior to issuing a margin call. See\nNote 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on how we determine the fair values of the RMBS collateralizing our repurchase agreements.\nThe table below presents our average daily repurchase balance and the repurchase balance at each period end for the periods presented. Our balance at period-end tends to fluctuate from the average daily balances due to the adjusting of the size of our portfolio by using leverage. We continue to deploy capital for strategic purchases of investments.\n\nWe are not required to maintain any specific leverage ratio. We believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our total debt was approximately $22.6 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively, which represented a leverage ratio for both periods of approximately 6.1:1 and 4.6:1. We include our repurchase agreements and securitized debt in the numerator of our leverage ratio and stockholders' equity as the denominator.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had repurchase agreements with 30 counterparties. All of our repurchase agreements are secured by Agency, Non-Agency RMBS and Loans held for investments or, in limited circumstances, cash. Under these repurchase agreements we may not be able to reclaim our collateral but still be obligated to pay our repurchase obligations. We mitigate this risk by spreading our exposure to multiple counterparties, as well as ensuring our counterparties are highly rated. Therefore, we believe the risk of loss of our collateral posted is mitigated by the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $15.8 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, of securities pledged against our repurchase agreement obligations.\nAt December 31, 2018, our repurchase agreements have original maturities ranging from less than 30 days to 1,817 days and a weighted average original maturity of 135 days. We expect to renew most of our repurchase agreements at maturity. When we renew our repurchase agreements, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain as favorable an interest rate as a result of rising rates.\nWe offset the interest rate risk of our repurchase agreements primarily through the use of interest rate swaps, swaptions and treasury futures. The average remaining maturities on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 range from less than 1 year to 30 years and have a weighted average maturity of approximately 7 years. All of our swaps are cleared by a central clearing house. When our interest rate swaps are in a net loss position (expected cash payments are in excess of expected cash receipts on the swaps), we post collateral as required by the terms of our swap agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we have two swaption counterparties and two futures counterparties.\nExposure to Financial Counterparties\nWe actively manage the number of repurchase agreement counterparties. The following table summarizes our exposure to our repurchase agreement counterparties at December 31, 2018:\n\n(1) Represents the amount of securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and unrealized loss on swaps for each counterparty.\nOver the past several years, several large European financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large European banks or institutions. Some of these financial institutions or their U.S. subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions. We have entered into repurchase agreements or exchange cleared interest rate swaps with 6 counterparties as of December 31, 2018 that are either domiciled in Europe or is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a European-domiciled financial institution.\nIf the European credit volatility, including countries that may choose to leave the Euro zone as Britain has, continues to impact these major European financial institutions, it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their U.S. subsidiaries. Our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events. We monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions, financial relief plans, credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties. We make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps, or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary.\nAt December 31, 2018, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nStockholders' Equity\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors reauthorized $100 million under our share repurchase program, or the Repurchase Program. Such authorization does not have an expiration date and, at present, there is no intention to modify or otherwise rescind such authorization. Shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market, including through block purchases, through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Among other factors, we intend to only consider repurchasing shares of our common stock when the purchase price is less than the last publicly reported book value per common share. In addition, we do not intend to repurchase any shares from directors, officers or other affiliates. The program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases will be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases.\nPursuant to our Repurchase Program, during the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 883 thousand shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.81 per share for a total of $15 million. There were no other stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other than a de minimis amount issued under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and\nas discussed below under Restricted Stock Grants,\u201d we did not issue any common shares during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nIn September 2018, we issued 10,400,000 shares of 7.75% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Series C Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $25.00 per share and for net proceeds to us of $252 million. The Series C Preferred Stock is redeemable at $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) exclusively at our option commencing in September 30, 2025, subject to our right, under limited circumstances, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock prior to that date. The initial dividend rate for the Series C Preferred Stock, from and including September 20, 2018, to but not including September 30, 2025, will be equal to 7.75% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual rate of $1.9375 per share). On and after September 30, 2025, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will accumulate at a percentage of the $25.00 liquidation preference equal to an annual floating rate of the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.743% per annum. The Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, when and as declared, a dividend at a rate of 7.75% per year on the $25.00 liquidation preference before the common stock is paid any dividends and is senior to the common stock with respect to distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nWe declared dividends to Series A preferred stockholders of $12 million, or $2.00 per preferred share, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe declared dividends to Series B preferred stockholders of $26 million and $22 million, or $2.00 and $1.68 per preferred share, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe declared dividends to Series C preferred stock holders of $6 million, or $0.54 per preferred share during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRestricted Stock Unit Grants\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted certain of our employees and directors Restricted Stock Units, or RSU awards. RSU awards are designed to reward our employees for services provided over the previous year. Generally, the RSU awards vest equally over a three-year period beginning from the grant date and will fully vest after three years. The RSU awards are valued at the market price of our common stock on the grant date and the employees must be employed by us on the vesting dates to receive the RSU awards. We granted 335 thousand and 204 thousand RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, with a grant date fair value of $6 million and $4 million, respectively, which will be recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted certain employees 133 thousand and 144 thousand Performance Share Units, or PSU awards, respectively. PSU awards are designed to align compensation with our future performance. The PSU awards include a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The final number of shares that will vest will be between 0% to 150% of the total PSU awards granted based on our total shareholder return as compared to an index of comparable financial institutions and will cliff vest at the end of the performance period. The PSU awards are measured at fair value on the grant date which will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year vesting period. Fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model developed to value the specific features of the PSU awards, including market based conditions. Inputs into the model include our historical volatility, the peer average historical volatility, and the correlation coefficient of the volatility. In addition, inputs also included the share price at the beginning of the measurement period and an estimated total shareholder return for both us and the peer group of comparable financial institutions. Based on the model results, the 133 thousand PSU awards granted during 2018 had a grant date value of $2 million that will cliff vest on December 31, 2020. The 144 thousand PSU awards granted during 2017 had a grant date value of $3 million which will cliff vest on December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were approximately 1.2 million and 770 thousand unvested shares of restricted stock units issued to our employees, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The estimated principal repayment schedule of the securitized debt is based on expected cash flows of the residential mortgage loans or RMBS, as adjusted for expected principal writedowns on the underlying collateral of the debt.\n\n(1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.\n\n(1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nNot included in the table above are the unfunded construction loan commitments of $1.1 billion and $567 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which will primarily be paid within one year of reported periods and are reported under Payables for investments purchased in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nWe have made a $25 thousand investment to acquire 24.9% ownership interest in KAH Capital through one of our taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition to the investment in KAH Capital, we have made a $150 million capital commitment to Hains Point (Hains Point), which is KAH Capital's initial fund for which we are the sole investor. KAH Capital will manage the investments in Hains Point including asset selection, repurchase and other financing arrangements as well as hedging transactions. Capital calls for investments made in Hains Point are subject to our consent and approval. We expect that KAH Capital will earn $6.5 million over approximately 3 years for its investment advisory services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nDividends\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Before we pay any dividend, we must first meet any operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our financing facilities and other debt payable.\nInflation\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our Board of Directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and financial condition are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies and accounting estimates are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are described in this section. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires management to make assumptions or judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made or require significant management judgment in interpreting the accounting literature. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, or other accounting judgments were made, this could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These critical accounting policies were developed by management, and reviewed by our auditors, prior to being presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe consolidated financial statements include, on a consolidated basis, our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including OTTI of Non-Agency RMBS, valuation of Loans held for investments, Agency and Non-Agency RMBS and interest rate swaps and income recognition on Loans held for investments and Non-Agency RMBS. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nInterest Income and Impairment on Non-Agency and Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nWe invest in RMBS representing interests in obligations backed by pools of residential mortgage loans. We delineate between (1) Agency RMBS and (2) Non-Agency RMBS as follows: The Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, and other RMBS representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of residential mortgage loans issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest repayment by agencies of the U.S. Government or federally chartered corporations such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Non-Agency RMBS are not issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and are therefore subject to credit risk.\nWe hold certain of our RMBS as available-for-sale, record these investments at estimated fair value as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, and include unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in Other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unrealized gains and losses on RMBS investments for which we have elected fair value option, are included in Net unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, as part of the overall management of our portfolio, we may sell any of our RMBS investments and recognize a realized gain or loss as a component of earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations utilizing the average method.\nOur accounting policies for recognition of interest income and OTTI related to RMBS are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As noted therein, there are three different accounting models that may be applicable for purposes of the recognition of interest income and OTTI on RMBS, and include the following:\nASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (ASC 310-20) - applies to certain Agency MBS and certain Non-Agency RMBS of high credit quality that, at the time of purchase, we expect to collect all contractual cash flows and the security cannot be contractually prepaid in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30) - applies to Non-Agency RMBS where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality and we do not expect to collect all contractual cash flows of the security.\nASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (ASC 325-40) - applies to certain Non-Agency RMBS and Agency MBS for which we have elected fair value option and are not within the scope of ASC 310-20 or ASC 310-30. These include Non-Agency RMBS which is not of high credit quality at the time of purchase or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nThe determination of which accounting model to apply will have a significant impact on the amounts of interest income and OTTI losses reflected in the results of operations because each accounting model has different requirements regarding the cash flows used to calculate interest income and impairments (i.e., contractual cash flows vs. expected cash flows) and the manner of such calculations, and the impact of changes in prepayment assumptions on interest income or OTTI losses.\nFor Agency and Non-Agency MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20, the amount of interest income recorded over the life of a security will be equal to the contractual cash flows of the security and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discount or premium. The amount of interest income reported in any particular financial reporting period will, however, vary depending on the actual and estimated prepayments on the security. For Agency MBS purchased at a premium to the principal amount, increases in prepayment speeds will generally result in a reduction of the recorded amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period whereas decreases in prepayment speeds will generally result in an increase in the amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period. The opposite is generally the case for Agency MBS purchased at a discount to the principal amount. That is, as prepayment speeds increase, interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally increase, whereas interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally decrease when prepayment speeds decline. However, volatility in the reported amount of interest income will result when there are significant changes in actual or future expected prepayment speeds regardless of the direction of those changes. This volatility is because the accounting model that we apply under ASC 310-20 requires us to record a cumulative adjustment, on a retrospective basis from the acquisition date of the security, when there are changes in prepayment speeds. That cumulative adjustment at each reporting date is intended to reflect the most current estimate of the timing of prepayments over the life of the security (both actual prepayments that have occurred in the past and the timing of prepayments that will occur in the future).\nAgency MBS and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20 may experience an OTTI loss. The OTTI loss recognized in earnings will be calculated based on the present value of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to recognition of an OTTI loss, we recognize income on these securities under ASC 310-30 as further described below.\nFor Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40, the reported amounts of interest income and OTTI are significantly impacted by management judgments around both the amount and timing of credit losses (defaults) and prepayments. Interest income on these Non-Agency RMBS is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. Furthermore, the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments also impacts the amount of OTTI losses recognized in earnings.\nNon-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40 is generally purchased at a discount to the principal amount. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calculate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Depending on the nature of the changes in the timing or amount of cash flows expected to be collected, whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayment assumptions, the following will occur:\n \u2022 If there is a positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, the effective interest rate in future accounting periods may increase resulting in an increase in the reported amount of interest income in future periods. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes must be considered significant for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 for the effective interest rate in future accounting periods to increase. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has increased from the previous estimate. This can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from reductions in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, a positive change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the positive impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the negative impact of increased defaults, or when the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults exceeds the negative impact of an extension of the timing of receipt of cash flows. \n \u2022 If there is a negative (or adverse) change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, and the securities' fair value is below its amortized cost, an OTTI loss equal to the adverse change in cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the securities' effective rate before impairment, is required to be recorded in current period earnings. For Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in future periods will decline because of the reduced balance of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. \nAdditionally, for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 325-40, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income during the period directly after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in such future period will decline, absent an increase in cash flows expected to be collected, because of the reduced amount of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. An adverse change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has decreased from the most previous estimate. This change can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from increases in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, an adverse change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the negative impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults, or when the negative impact of an increase in estimated defaults exceeds the positive impact of a shortening of the timing of receipt of cash flows.\nThe accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 are impacted by both assumptions of prepayments and assumptions of credit losses (defaults) and, accordingly, changes in the amounts of recorded interest income or OTTI losses over financial reporting periods cannot be considered to result solely from the impact of changes in the credit profile of the investment or solely from the impact of changes in prepayment speeds. Furthermore, while there may be some level of correlation between assumptions for defaults and prepayments as general market interest rates change, in the recent market conditions that correlation has not been direct or predictable.\nInterest Income on Loans held for investments at fair value\nInterest income on Loans held for investments at fair value is accounted for under ASC 325-40. Interest income on these Loans held for investments at fair value is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calculate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected.\nDetermination of appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS is dependent on management's assessment and judgment related to the following factors made as of the acquisition date:\n \u2022 Our assessment of the credit quality of the asset, including its credit rating at the acquisition date and whether the security has experienced deterioration in credit quality since its inception. \n \u2022 Our assessment of the probability of collection of all contractual cash flows. \n \u2022 Our assessment of whether the security can be contractually prepaid such that we would not recover our initial investment. \nThe most critical judgment inherent in the determination of the appropriate accounting model is our assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. In making this accounting judgment, we consider expected defaults and prepayments as further described below.\nImpact of prepayment assumptions on MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20\nChanges in actual prepayments will impact the amount of interest income recognized in each financial reporting period for MBS accounted for under ASC 310-20. We estimate expected prepayment as further described below.\nImpact of default and prepayment assumptions on Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40\nIn determining the OTTI related to credit losses for Non-Agency RMBS securities accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows is the effective interest rate or effective yield used for income recognition purposes.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. For VIEs' that do not have substantial on-going activities, the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance may be determined by an entity's involvement with the design of the VIE.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition contain the assets and liabilities related to twenty-nine consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs. Due to the non-recourse nature of these VIEs our net exposure to loss from investments in these entities is limited to our retained beneficial interests.\nAt December 31, 2018, we consolidated twenty-five residential mortgage loan securitizations and four RMBS re-securitization transactions which are VIEs. The residential mortgage loan securitizations contain jumbo prime and sub prime residential mortgage loans. The RMBS re-securitization transactions contain Non-Agency RMBS comprised of primarily what we classify as collateral backed by Alt-A first lien mortgages of 2005-2007 vintages. We categorize collateral as Alt-A regardless of whether the loans were originally described as prime\u201d if the behavior of the collateral when we purchased the security more resembles typical Alt-A collateral. We define Alt-A collateral characteristics to be evidenced by the 60+ day delinquency bucket of the pool being greater than 5% and the weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination as greater than 650.\nOur determination to consolidate these twenty-nine VIEs was significantly influenced by management's judgment related to the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the identification of the party with the power over such activities. For the residential mortgage loan securitizations, we determined that our ability to direct the servicer resulted in us having the power that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE. For the four consolidated RMBS re-securitization transactions, we determined that no party has power over any ongoing activities of the entities and therefore the determination of the primary beneficiary should be based on involvement with the initial design of the entity. Since we transferred the RMBS to the securitization entities, we determined we had the power over the design of the entity, which resulted in us being considered the primary beneficiary. This determination was influenced by the amount of economic exposure to the financial performance of the entity and required a significant management judgment in determining that we should consolidate these four entities.\nDue to the consolidation of these VIEs, our actual ownership interests in the securitization and re-securitizations have been eliminated in consolidation and the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect both the assets held and non-recourse debt issued to third parties by these VIEs. In addition, our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts\nrelated to the assets and liabilities of the VIEs as opposed to the actual economic interests we own in these VIEs. Our interest in these VIEs is restricted to the beneficial interests we retained in these transactions. We are not obligated to provide any financial support to these VIEs.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition separately present: (i) our direct assets and liabilities, and (ii) the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. Assets of all consolidated VIEs can only be used to satisfy the obligations of those VIEs, and the liabilities of consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.\nWe have aggregated all the assets and liabilities of the consolidated securitization vehicles due to our determination that these entities are substantively similar and therefore a further disaggregated presentation would not be more meaningful. The notes to our consolidated financial statements describe our direct assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our investments in VIEs.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. Specifically, this guidance defines fair value based on exit price, or the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for RMBS are based on models that consider the estimated cash flows expected to be collected from the underlying collateral and an estimated market-based yield reflective of the unique attributes of the tranche including, but not limited to, assumptions related to prepayment speeds, the frequency and severity of defaults and attributes of the collateral underlying such securities. Estimates of the fair value of RMBS are particularly sensitive to assumptions related to the expected timing of prepayments, the extent of defaults, and the severity of expected losses. Management reviews the fair values generated by the model to determine whether prices are reflective of the current market. Management indirectly corroborates its estimates of the fair value using pricing models by comparing its results to independent prices provided by third party pricing services.\nTo the extent the inputs used to estimate fair value are observable, the values would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise they would be categorized as Level 3. The Company's fair value estimation process utilizes inputs other than quoted prices that are observed in the market. The Company's estimate of prepayment, default and severity curves all involve adjustments that are deemed to be significant to the fair value measurement process, which renders the resulting Non-Agency fair value estimates Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets represent approximately 55% and 79% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represent approximately 98% and 100% of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2(o) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
