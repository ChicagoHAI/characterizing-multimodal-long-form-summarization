Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nOn December 1, 2015, SBS completed the Merger with privately-held BMHC in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS. SBS survived the Merger and in connection therewith changed its name to BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\u201d The financial statements represent the financial statements of BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the Merger was treated as a reverse merger\u201d under the acquisition method of accounting. For accounting purposes, BMHC is considered to have acquired SBS. Consequently, the historical financial statements of the Company reflect only the operations and financial condition of BMHC prior to the Merger. The operating results of SBS are included as part of the Company's reported results beginning on the closing date of the Merger.\nWe are one of the leading providers of diversified building products and services in the U.S. residential construction market. Our objective is to provide best-in-class customer service and value-added products to our customers, which are primarily single- and multi-family home builders and professional remodelers. Our product offerings include lumber and lumber sheet goods and an array of value-added products including millwork, doors, windows and structural components such as EWP, floor and roof trusses and wall panels. Our whole-house framing solution, Ready-Frame\u00ae, which is one of our fastest growing product offerings, saves builders both time and money and improves job site safety. We also offer our customers important services such as design, product specification, installation and installation management.\nAs part of our initiatives to execute our strategic plan, including growing our value-added product and service offerings and expanding our presence in the professional remodeling space, we plan to expand our business through organic and acquisitive means. The 18 states in which we operate accounted for approximately 65% of 2017 U.S. single-family housing permits according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In these 18 states, we operate in 43 metropolitan areas, which accounted for approximately half of the permits issued in those states, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, providing significant opportunity for growth.\nOur net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 8.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We estimate net sales increased 2.8% due to organic sales volume, 1.8% due to the acquisitions of Code Plus Components, LLC (\"Code Plus\") and Texas Plywood & Lumber Company, Inc. (\"TexPly\") and 4.2% due to commodity price inflation. Our gross margin was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 24.0% for the prior year period. We recorded income from operations of $101.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $83.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. See further discussion in -Operating Results\u201d below.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including, among others, acquisitions, conditions in the housing market and economic conditions generally, changes in the cost of the products we sell (particularly commodity products), pricing policies of our competitors, production schedules of our customers and seasonality. Some of the more important factors are briefly discussed below.\nMerger and acquisitions\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of TexPly, a supplier of production millwork and doors in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for a purchase price of $31.7 million, including the purchase of real estate.\nOn March 27, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Code Plus, a truss manufacturer located in Martinsburg, West Virginia serving the Washington DC market, for a purchase price of $7.1 million.\nAs discussed above, on December 1, 2015, SBS completed the Merger with privately-held BMHC in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS.\nOn September 1, 2015, BMHC purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Marietta, Georgia-based Robert Bowden Inc. (\"RBI\") for a purchase price of $102.4 million. RBI has three locations in the Atlanta, Georgia area and sells millwork and window products to homebuilders and residential contractors.\nOn May 1, 2015, BMHC completed the acquisition of Vidalia, Georgia-based VNS Corporation (\"VNS\") for a purchase price of $47.1 million. VNS has nine locations in southern Georgia and sells building materials and provides construction services in the southeastern United States.\nNet sales increased by approximately $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the acquisitions of TexPly and Code Plus. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased by approximately $1.4 billion as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of RBI and VNS.\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our acquisitions.\nConditions in the housing and construction market\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly dependent on new single-family home and multi-family construction and repair and remodeling activity, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including, among other things, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, wage rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing, the availability of qualified trade laborers, the health of the economy and mortgage markets and the availability of personal income tax deductions related to home ownership, some of which were limited by the 2017 Tax Act. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, were 0.55 million, 0.60 million and 0.66 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of November 2017, Dodge Data & Analytics (formerly McGraw-Hill) forecasted that U.S. single-family housing starts will increase approximately 7% in 2018. Additionally, the S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a leading measure of pricing for the U.S. residential housing market, has increased on a year-over-year basis for 67 straight months as of November 2017 and in November 2017, the index reached its highest levels ever.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, multi-family housing starts in the United States reached a low of 0.11 million in 2009, but reached levels of 0.40 million, 0.39 million and 0.35 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. While this end market has receded since 2015, the multi-family space represents a significant opportunity for us to capture additional market share and provide value-added solutions.\nThe professional remodeling space, when compared to new home construction, tends to be less price sensitive and more resilient to broader economic conditions. As of September 2017, the Home Improvement Research Institute estimated 2017 and 2018 U.S. sales of home maintenance, repair and improvement products to the professional market would reach approximately $103 billion and $106 billion, respectively, compared to sales of approximately $94 billion and $100 billion in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Several factors, including the overall age of the U.S. housing stock, rising home prices, availability of consumer capital at historically low interest rates and focus on energy efficiency may drive long-term growth in repair and remodeling expenditures.\nOverall economic conditions in the markets where we operate\nEconomic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business. We believe continued strong employment levels, access to financing and strong consumer confidence will be necessary to increase household formation rates. We believe improved household formation rates in turn will increase demand for housing and stimulate new construction.\nCommodity nature of our products\nMany of the building products we distribute, including lumber, OSB, plywood and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently based on participants' perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors.\nThe following table reflects changes in the average composite framing lumber prices (per thousand board feet) and average composite structural panel prices (per thousand square feet). These prices represent transactions between manufacturers and their customers as reported by Random Lengths and may differ in magnitude or timing from the actual selling prices or cost of goods reported in our operating results. The average composite structural panel prices are based on index prices for OSB and plywood.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Versus 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Average Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Versus 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Average Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Average Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Framing lumber prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Structural panel prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPeriods of increasing prices provide the opportunity for higher sales and increased gross profit, while periods of declining prices may result in declines in sales and profitability. In particular, low market prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in market prices. For further discussion of the impact of commodity prices on historical periods, see -Operating Results.\u201d\nConsolidation of production homebuilders\nOver the past ten years, the homebuilding industry has undergone consolidation and many production homebuilders have increased their market share. We expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. Our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we face in our markets with certain profitability expectations. We expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest production homebuilders will be vital to our ability to expand into new markets as well as grow our market share. While we generate significant sales from these homebuilders, our gross margins on sales to them tend to be lower than our gross margins on sales to other market segments. This could impact our gross margins if the market share held by the largest production homebuilders continues to increase.\nOur ability to control expenses\nWe pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses. We employ a LEAN process operating philosophy, which encourages continuous improvement in our core processes to minimize waste, improve customer service, increase expense productivity, improve working capital and maximize profitability and cash flow. We regularly analyze our workforce productivity to achieve the optimum, cost-efficient labor mix for our facilities. Further, we pay careful attention to our logistics function and have implemented GPS-enabled telematics technology across our delivery fleet to improve customer service, driver safety and the productivity of our shipping and handling costs.\nMix of products sold\nWe typically realize greater gross margins on more highly engineered and customized products, or ancillary products that are often purchased based on convenience and are therefore less price sensitive to our customers. For example, sales of lumber & lumber sheet goods tend to generate lower gross margins due to their commodity nature and the relatively low switching costs of sourcing those products from different suppliers. Structural components and millwork, doors & windows often generate higher gross margins relative to other products. Homebuilders often use structural components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. We believe shortening cycle time from start to completion is a key goal of homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand or limited availability of framing labor. As the residential new construction market continues to strengthen, we expect the use of structural components by homebuilders to increase.\nChanges in customer sales mix\nOur operating results may vary according to the amount and type of products we sell to each of our primary customer types: new single-family homebuilders, professional remodeling contractors, and multi-family builders and light commercial builders. The following table reflects our estimate of net sales by each customer type. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family homebuilders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,523,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,262,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,258,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional remodeling contractors\n</td> <td>379,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (including multi-family & light commercial builders)\n</td> <td>462,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,365,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,093,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,576,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe tend to realize higher gross margins on sales to remodeling contractors due to the smaller product volumes purchased by those customers, as well as the more customized nature of the projects those customers generally undertake. Gross margins on sales to single-family, multi-family and light commercial customers can vary based on a variety of factors, including the purchase volumes of the individual customer, the mix of products sold to that customer, the size and selling price of the project being constructed and the number of upgrades added to the project before or during its construction.\nFreight costs and fuel charges\nA portion of our shipping and handling costs is comprised of diesel and other fuels purchased for our delivery fleet and handling equipment. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average retail price per gallon for No. 2 diesel fuel was $2.65, $2.31 and $2.71 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred costs of approximately $14.8 million within selling, general and administrative expenses for diesel and other fuels used for our delivery fleet and handling equipment. Future increases in the cost of fuel, or inbound freight costs for the products we purchase, could impact our operating results and cash flows if we are unable to pass along these cost increases to our customers through increased prices.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth our operating results in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\nTable 99:

increased $272.2 million, or 8.8%, to $3,366.0 million from $3,093.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of commodity price inflation of approximately 4.2% and increased volume of approximately 2.8% related to existing operations, while the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly increased net sales by approximately 1.8%.\nWe estimate approximately 75% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were to customers engaged in new single-family construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, increased approximately 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year, while single-family houses completed increased 8.7% during the same time period. Increases in net sales from Texas and California accounted for approximately 42% of the total increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, while the Company experienced a decrease in net sales in Georgia of less than 1% of overall net sales.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $2.9 million of expense incurred in relation to the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger. We estimate our cost of sales increased approximately 5.0% as a result of commodity cost inflation, 2.8% as a result of increased sales volumes related to existing operations and 1.6% related to the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly, partially offset by a 0.1% decrease as a result of the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value.\nGross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $53.6 million, or 7.2%, to $795.5 million from $742.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by increased sales volumes and commodity price inflation. Our gross margin was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decline resulted primarily from a decline in gross margin in lumber & lumber sheet goods and structural components and a greater percentage of total net sales derived from lumber & lumber sheet goods, which generally generate lower margins. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by $2.9 million, or 0.1% of net sales, in relation to the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger.\nOperating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million, or 8.4%, to $619.5 million, or 18.4% of net sales, from $571.8 million, or 18.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $16.5 million of this increase related to increased shipping and handling costs to serve higher sales volumes related to existing operations, $12.5 million related to selling, general and administrative expenses of TexPly and Code Plus, $5.6 million related to an increase in the provision for workers' compensation claims and $5.5 million related to increased health care costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $2.8 million of expense related to the discontinuance of the new third-party software BMHC selected in 2013 for its planned Enterprise Resource Planning system (\"New ERP\") (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Company recognized asset impairment charges of $0.4 million related to the write down of real estate held for sale to the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs.

In connection with this decision, the Company impaired capitalized software costs that had previously been recorded as construction-in-progress within property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense was $25.0 million compared to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease relates primarily to reduced average borrowings under the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement (the \"Revolver\") and a decrease in interest expense on the Senior Notes after the Company redeemed $250.0 million of 9.0% senior secured notes (the \"Extinguished Senior Notes\") with the proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes during September 2016. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, was $1.7 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the Extinguished Senior Notes. The loss is made up of a call premium of $8.4 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $4.1 million. There were no similar costs in 2017.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income, net was $5.7 million, which consisted primarily of income related to the final settlement of insurance claims made by the Company for a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015, income from tax incentive programs and service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other income, net was $4.1 million, which consisted primarily of insurance proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015 and service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable.\nIncome tax\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, income tax expense was $24.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.8% compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, an Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") section 199 manufacturing deduction, and excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions. Excluding the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been 34.2%. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a net income tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2017 primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the adoption of a state tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on a state net operating loss carryforward, excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, and an IRC section 199 manufacturing deduction.\nThe Company expects our 2018 annual effective tax rate to be lower than our current year effective tax rate primarily due to a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. In addition to the lower corporate income tax rate, other tax law changes related to the 2017 Tax Act that may impact our Company's tax provision in subsequent years include, but are not limited to, the acceleration of tax depreciation for certain assets, repeal of the section 199 manufacturing deduction, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased $1,517.0 million, or 96.2%, to $3,093.7 million from $1,576.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by increased volume of approximately 6.3% related to existing operations and 88.7% related to the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, while the impact of commodity price inflation increased net sales by approximately 1.2%.\nWe estimate approximately 73% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were to customers engaged in new single-family construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, increased approximately 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, while single-family houses completed increased 13.6% during the same time period.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category.

We estimate our cost of sales increased approximately 92.1% as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, while organic change accounted for an increase of 1.4%. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes $2.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of expense incurred in relation to the sell-through of Legacy SBS inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger.\nGross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit increased $380.6 million, or 105.3%, to $742.0 million from $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven primarily by the Merger and the acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as well as increased sales volumes. Our gross margin was 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a higher percentage of total net sales being derived from millwork, doors & windows, which generally are sold at a higher gross margin than our other product categories, as well as increased consideration from supplier agreements.\nOperating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>selling, general and administrative expenses increased $265.0 million, or 86.3%, to $571.8 million, or 18.5% of net sales, from $306.8 million, or 19.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation expense increased $22.7 million, or 144.8%, to $38.4 million from $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of fixed assets acquired through the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as well as replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>amortization expense was $20.7 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year.

This increase relates primarily to SBS borrowings that were assumed by the Company as of the date of the Merger and borrowings used to fund the acquisition of RBI. This increase was partially offset by reduced borrowing levels on the Revolver after repaying approximately $74 million of Revolver borrowings from proceeds received from the Company's refinancing of its Senior Notes in September 2016. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, was $3.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the Extinguished Senior Notes.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the adoption of a state tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on a state net operating loss carryforward, excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, and an IRC section 199 manufacturing deduction. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate was higher than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to adopting a tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and other built-in losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments and fund capital expenditures. During 2017 and 2016, our capital resources have primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents generated through operating cash flows, proceeds from the September 2016 issuance of the Senior Notes and borrowings under our Revolver.\nOur liquidity at December 31, 2017 was $320.0 million, which includes $11.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $308.2 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Revolver.\nWe believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next 12 months.\nHistorical Cash Flow Information\nNet current assets\nNet current assets (current assets less current liabilities) were $418.9 million and $364.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net of allowances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(307,538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(291,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,739\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable, net, increased $9.6 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in sales, partially offset by a decrease in days sales outstanding (measured against net sales in the fourth quarter of each period), which were 38 days at December 31, 2016 and 35 days at December 31, 2017.\nInventories, net, increased $36.8 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to commodity price inflation and increases in sales.

Changes in other assets and liabilities relate primarily to the timing of cash received from customers and cash paid to vendors.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $106.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily related to improved profitability and the effects of the Merger, whereby the year ended December 31, 2016 contains a full year of Legacy SBS cash flows, while the year ended December 31, 2015 only contains the cash flows of Legacy SBS beginning on the date that the Merger was completed, December 1, 2015.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $88.3 million, $33.7 million and $135.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, equipment and real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(149,485\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of property, equipment and real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in restricted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(88,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(135,076\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used for the purchase of property, equipment and real estate for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from the purchase of vehicles and equipment to support increased sales volume and replace aged assets, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. Proceeds from the sale of property, equipment and real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017 relates primarily to the sale of real estate of $12.7 million.\nPurchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, for the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly and for the year ended December 31, 2015, relate to the acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as discussed in \"Factors Affecting our Operating Results\" above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received insurance proceeds related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015, of which $1.2 million related to property, plant and equipment damaged in the fire.\nDuring 2013, BMHC deposited $46.4 million in a separate bank account to collateralize letters of credit related to insurance claims for periods prior to January 2010. During 2015, BMHC was able to release the majority of these amounts into unrestricted cash as a result of reductions in claims and the transfer of the risk of loss of certain claims to a reinsurer in January 2015. In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into on December 1, 2015, the Company was able to release the remaining cash collateral into unrestricted cash.\nCash acquired in the Merger of $6.3 million represents cash and cash equivalents of SBS on the closing date of the Merger.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(2.8) million, $(65.3) million and $72.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds from (repayments of) Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(152,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments on capital leases and other notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of Extinguished Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(250,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments of debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings under other notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other financing activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(687\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had proceeds from the Revolver, net of repayments, of $4.5 million. The Company made net repayments of $152.3 million on the Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $74 million of this repayment was funded through net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes issuance, after payment of accrued interest, debt issuance costs and the call premium. Proceeds from the Revolver, net of repayments, of $84.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates primarily to amounts borrowed to purchase RBI in September 2015, as well as purchases of property and equipment.\nPayments on capital leases and other notes increased during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to new financing of handling equipment to support higher sales volumes as well as one-time payments made during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the payoff of certain other notes.\nDuring September 2016, the Company completed an issuance of $350.0 million of Senior Notes and utilized a portion of the cash proceeds from the issuance to redeem in full the $250.0 million Extinguished Senior Notes. The Company incurred $6.7 million of debt issuance costs related to the Senior Notes, and paid a call premium of $8.4 million related to the Extinguished Senior Notes. The debt issuance costs incurred during 2015 relate primarily to third-party and lender costs incurred in relation to the Credit Agreement.\nDuring May 2016, the Company commenced a public offering of 5,700,000 shares of its common stock by certain stockholders. In connection with the offering, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 855,000 shares of common stock. The underwriters exercised this option, which generated gross proceeds of $14.5 million and net proceeds of $13.8 million, after subtracting $0.7 million of underwriting commissions and other fees.\nBorrowings under other notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 relate to notes secured by certain operating equipment. No such borrowings were made during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options, which are included in other financing activities, net, were $3.4 million, $1.3 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other financing activities, net also includes net activity related to secured borrowings and purchases of treasury stock in connection with shares withheld on vesting and exercises of equity awards.\nCapital expenditures\nCapital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures, including the incurrence of capital lease obligations and net of proceeds from the sale of property, equipment and real estate to be approximately $55.0 million to $65.0 million primarily related to vehicles and equipment, including lease buyouts, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. We are still evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our level of capital expenditures, which may incentivize us to increase our level of capital spending during 2018.\nSenior secured notes\nOn September 15, 2016, the Company issued $350.0 million of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2024 and are secured by a first priority lien on certain assets of the Company and a second priority lien on the collateral that secures the Credit Agreement, which collectively approximates substantially all assets of the Company. The interest rate is fixed at 5.5% and is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1. The Indenture contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including restrictions on new indebtedness, issuance of liens and guarantees, investments, distributions to equityholders, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Senior Notes were issued by BMC East, LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, and are guaranteed by the Company and the other subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. Each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, and all guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture as of December 31, 2017.\nRevolving credit agreement\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the Merger, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which includes the Revolver, has an aggregate commitment of $375.0 million and a letters of credit sublimit of $100.0 million. The Revolver matures at the earlier of (i) December 1, 2020 and (ii) the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the Senior Notes, or if the Senior Notes are refinanced or repaid, the date that is three months prior to the new maturity date of the replacement notes or other indebtedness\nthat replaced or refinanced the Senior Notes. The Revolver is subject to an asset-based borrowing formula on eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables and inventory, in each case reduced by certain reserves.\nBorrowings under the Revolver bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (which means the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.0% or (iii) the prime rate) plus a Base Rate Margin (which ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% based on Revolver availability) or LIBOR plus a LIBOR Rate Margin (which ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% based on Revolver availability).The fee on any outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolver ranges from 0.75% to 1.25%, depending on whether the letters of credit are fully cash collateralized. The fee on the unused portion of the Revolver is 0.25%.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including restrictions on new indebtedness, issuance of liens, investments, distributions to equityholders, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00:1:00, as defined therein. However, the covenant is only applicable if excess availability under the Credit Agreement is less than or equal to the greater of (i) $33.3 million and (ii) 10% of the line cap, and remains in effect until excess availability has been greater than the greater of (i) $33.3 million and (ii) 10% of the line cap for 30 consecutive days. While there can be no assurances, based upon our forecast, we do not expect the financial covenant to become applicable during the year ended December 31, 2018. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in certain accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets of the Company and a second-priority security interest in substantially all other assets of the Company that secure the Senior Notes on a first-priority basis.\nWe had outstanding borrowings of $4.5 million with net availability of $308.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017, all of which were Base Rate borrowings, was 4.75%. We had $62.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table. We have not included liabilities related to self-insurance reserves in the table below, as these reserves represent an estimate of our future obligations and do not represent cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business and commitments that are cancellable on 30 days' notice are excluded from the table below. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term debt (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents principal of $350.0 million and semi-annual interest payments at a 5.5% interest rate.

In addition, quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the volatility of lumber prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the pricing policies of our competitors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the production schedules of our customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effects of weather.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables, although this is generally offset in part by higher trade payables to our suppliers. Working capital levels typically increase in the second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction season. These increases have in the past resulted in negative operating cash flows during this peak season, which historically have been financed through available cash or excess availability on our Revolver. Collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season have in the past positively impacted cash flow. In the past, we have also utilized our borrowing availability under credit facilities to cover working capital needs.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our audited financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, actual results may be materially different from the estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue for sales of building products when products are delivered and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. All sales recognized are net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns, based on historical experience. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions are excluded from sales.\nThe percentage-of-completion method is used to recognize revenue for construction services. Periodic estimates of progress towards completion are made based on either a comparison of labor costs incurred to date with total estimated contract labor costs or total costs incurred to date with total estimated contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method requires the use of various estimates, including among others, the extent of progress towards completion, contract revenues and contract completion costs. Contract revenues and contract costs to be recognized are dependent on the accuracy of estimates, including quantities of materials, labor productivity and other cost estimates. The Company has a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards\ncompletion, contract revenues and contract completion costs. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual contract revenues and completion costs may vary from estimates.\nEstimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates reflect the Company's best estimate of probable losses of unbilled receivables, and are recognized in the period such revisions are known and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are recognized in cost of sales. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates are established by assessing estimated costs to complete, change orders and claims for uncompleted contracts. Assumptions for estimated costs to complete include material prices, labor costs, labor productivity and contract claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and therefore it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from these estimates.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), including subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model requiring companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate\u201d as it involves judgments about our customers' ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an assessment of individual past due accounts, historical write-off experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes and the business environment. Account balances are charged off when the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nManagement believes the allowance amounts recorded, in each instance, represent its best estimate of future outcomes. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of materials purchased for resale, including lumber and sheet goods, millwork, doors and windows as well as certain manufactured products, and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all of our inventories is determined by the weighted average cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out approach. We evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This evaluation includes an analysis of historical physical inventory results, a review of potential excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory aging and anticipated future demand. At least quarterly, each branch's perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect any declines in net realizable value below inventory carrying cost. To the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact, either favorably or unfavorably, the salability of our products or our relationships with certain key suppliers, our inventory reserves could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions.\nBusiness combinations\nFor all acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Management makes significant estimates and assumptions when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates include, but are not limited to, discount rates, projected future net sales, projected future expected cash flows and useful lives. When necessary, we will engage third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities.\nValuation of goodwill, long-lived assets and amortizable other intangible assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, purchased intangible assets and goodwill. The valuation and the impairment testing of these long-lived assets involve significant judgments and assumptions, particularly as they relate to the identification of reporting units, asset groups and the determination of fair market value.\nWe test our tangible and intangible long-lived assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur indicating that there may be impairment.\nWe have recorded goodwill and perform testing for potential goodwill impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is available, and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Additionally, components within an operating segment are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Beginning January 1, 2017, following the realignment of certain markets which resulted in the consolidation of the Company's historical Mountain West division into the Intermountain division, the Company's five operating segments, which have been determined to be the Company's reporting units, are the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Texas, Intermountain and Western divisions. Following the realignment, the chief operating decision maker continues to review aggregate information to allocate resources and assess performance. Based on this, as well as the similar economic characteristics, nature of products, distribution methods and customers of the divisions both before and after the realignment, the Company has aggregated its operating segments into one reportable segment. We complete our annual impairment assessment during the third quarter of each year. We did not recognize any impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nFor impairment testing of long-lived assets, we identify asset groups at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAs discussed above, changes in management intentions, market events or conditions, projected future net sales, operating results, cash flow of our reporting units and other similar circumstances could affect the assumptions used in the impairment tests. Although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and other long-lived assets are reasonable, differences between actual and expected net sales, operating results and cash flow could cause these assets to be impaired. If any asset were determined to be impaired, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, but not our cash flow from operations.\nStock based compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted restricted stock unit awards and performance restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and directors.\nWe account for restricted stock unit awards by recording compensation expense over the requisite service period, using graded vesting, based on the award's fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards is based on the price of our publicly traded common stock at the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards with performance conditions, we record compensation expense based on the expected number of units that will vest, which is adjusted, as appropriate, throughout the performance period.\nWe account for stock options granted to employees by recording compensation expense based on the award's fair value, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses inputs including the fair value per share of our common stock, volatility, expected term of the awards, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, based on management's judgment and subjective future expectations. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation recorded for future awards may differ materially from that recorded for awards granted previously.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nCasualty and health insurance\nWe carry insurance for general liability, auto liability and workers' compensation exposures subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we self-insure for employee and eligible dependent health care claims, with insurance purchased from independent carriers to cover individual claims in excess of the self-insured limits. The expected liability for unpaid claims, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined using the assistance of third-party actuaries and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability with current and long-term components. We have elected not to discount this liability. The amount recoverable from insurance providers is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Our accounting policy includes an internal evaluation and adjustment of our reserve for all insured losses on a quarterly basis. At least on an annual basis, we engage external actuarial professionals to independently assess and estimate the total liability outstanding, which is compared to the actual reserve balance at that time and adjusted accordingly.\nIncome taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The primary negative evidence considered includes the cumulative operating losses generated in prior periods. The primary positive evidence considered includes recent prior periods with cumulative operating income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization that would occur within the same jurisdiction and during the carry-forward period necessary to absorb the state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2017, the Company evaluated the positive and negative evidence in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2017, we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, net of a state tax valuation allowance of $0.1 million.\nASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and certain measurement principles for the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on an income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties associated with income taxes, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition requirements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognizes no material uncertain tax positions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the 2017 Tax Act. This legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from a maximum 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. The Company has recognized the net tax benefit of $3.6 million related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included this amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, on a provisional basis based on information currently available. The 2017 Tax Act may be subject to technical amendments, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, any of which could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation. As such, we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period ending no later than December 2018.\nConsideration received from suppliers\nWe enter into arrangements with many of our suppliers providing for inventory purchase rebates ( supplier rebates\u201d) upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels. We accrue estimated supplier rebates monthly as part of cost of goods sold based on progress toward earning the supplier rebates, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through the end of the year. We estimate the rebates applicable to inventory on-hand at each period end based on the inventory turns of the related items.\nUnder certain circumstances, including if market conditions were to change, suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs. Although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to product already purchased, it may impact our gross margins in future periods.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nOn December 1, 2015, SBS completed the Merger with privately-held BMHC in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS. SBS survived the Merger and in connection therewith changed its name to BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\u201d The financial statements represent the financial statements of BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the Merger was treated as a reverse merger\u201d under the acquisition method of accounting. For accounting purposes, BMHC is considered to have acquired SBS. Consequently, the historical financial statements of the Company reflect only the operations and financial condition of BMHC prior to the Merger. The operating results of SBS are included as part of the Company's reported results beginning on the closing date of the Merger.\nWe are one of the leading providers of diversified building products and services in the U.S. residential construction market. Our objective is to provide best-in-class customer service and value-added products to our customers, which are primarily single- and multi-family home builders and professional remodelers. Our product offerings include lumber and lumber sheet goods and an array of value-added products including millwork, doors, windows and structural components such as EWP, floor and roof trusses and wall panels. Our whole-house framing solution, Ready-Frame\u00ae, which is one of our fastest growing product offerings, saves builders both time and money and improves job site safety. We also offer our customers important services such as design, product specification, installation and installation management.\nAs part of our initiatives to execute our strategic plan, including growing our value-added product and service offerings and expanding our presence in the professional remodeling space, we plan to expand our business through organic and acquisitive means. The 18 states in which we operate accounted for approximately 65% of 2017 U.S. single-family housing permits according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In these 18 states, we operate in 43 metropolitan areas, which accounted for approximately half of the permits issued in those states, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, providing significant opportunity for growth.\nOur net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 8.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We estimate net sales increased 2.8% due to organic sales volume, 1.8% due to the acquisitions of Code Plus Components, LLC (\"Code Plus\") and Texas Plywood & Lumber Company, Inc. (\"TexPly\") and 4.2% due to commodity price inflation. Our gross margin was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 24.0% for the prior year period. We recorded income from operations of $101.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $83.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. See further discussion in -Operating Results\u201d below.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including, among others, acquisitions, conditions in the housing market and economic conditions generally, changes in the cost of the products we sell (particularly commodity products), pricing policies of our competitors, production schedules of our customers and seasonality. Some of the more important factors are briefly discussed below.\nMerger and acquisitions\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of TexPly, a supplier of production millwork and doors in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for a purchase price of $31.7 million, including the purchase of real estate.\nOn March 27, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Code Plus, a truss manufacturer located in Martinsburg, West Virginia serving the Washington DC market, for a purchase price of $7.1 million.\nAs discussed above, on December 1, 2015, SBS completed the Merger with privately-held BMHC in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS.\nOn September 1, 2015, BMHC purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Marietta, Georgia-based Robert Bowden Inc. (\"RBI\") for a purchase price of $102.4 million. RBI has three locations in the Atlanta, Georgia area and sells millwork and window products to homebuilders and residential contractors.\nOn May 1, 2015, BMHC completed the acquisition of Vidalia, Georgia-based VNS Corporation (\"VNS\") for a purchase price of $47.1 million. VNS has nine locations in southern Georgia and sells building materials and provides construction services in the southeastern United States.\nNet sales increased by approximately $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the acquisitions of TexPly and Code Plus. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased by approximately $1.4 billion as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of RBI and VNS.\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our acquisitions.\nConditions in the housing and construction market\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly dependent on new single-family home and multi-family construction and repair and remodeling activity, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including, among other things, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, wage rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing, the availability of qualified trade laborers, the health of the economy and mortgage markets and the availability of personal income tax deductions related to home ownership, some of which were limited by the 2017 Tax Act. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, were 0.55 million, 0.60 million and 0.66 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of November 2017, Dodge Data & Analytics (formerly McGraw-Hill) forecasted that U.S. single-family housing starts will increase approximately 7% in 2018. Additionally, the S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a leading measure of pricing for the U.S. residential housing market, has increased on a year-over-year basis for 67 straight months as of November 2017 and in November 2017, the index reached its highest levels ever.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, multi-family housing starts in the United States reached a low of 0.11 million in 2009, but reached levels of 0.40 million, 0.39 million and 0.35 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. While this end market has receded since 2015, the multi-family space represents a significant opportunity for us to capture additional market share and provide value-added solutions.\nThe professional remodeling space, when compared to new home construction, tends to be less price sensitive and more resilient to broader economic conditions. As of September 2017, the Home Improvement Research Institute estimated 2017 and 2018 U.S. sales of home maintenance, repair and improvement products to the professional market would reach approximately $103 billion and $106 billion, respectively, compared to sales of approximately $94 billion and $100 billion in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Several factors, including the overall age of the U.S. housing stock, rising home prices, availability of consumer capital at historically low interest rates and focus on energy efficiency may drive long-term growth in repair and remodeling expenditures.\nOverall economic conditions in the markets where we operate\nEconomic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business. We believe continued strong employment levels, access to financing and strong consumer confidence will be necessary to increase household formation rates. We believe improved household formation rates in turn will increase demand for housing and stimulate new construction.\nCommodity nature of our products\nMany of the building products we distribute, including lumber, OSB, plywood and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently based on participants' perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors.\nThe following table reflects changes in the average composite framing lumber prices (per thousand board feet) and average composite structural panel prices (per thousand square feet). These prices represent transactions between manufacturers and their customers as reported by Random Lengths and may differ in magnitude or timing from the actual selling prices or cost of goods reported in our operating results. The average composite structural panel prices are based on index prices for OSB and plywood.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Versus 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Average Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Versus 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Average Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Average Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Framing lumber prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Structural panel prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPeriods of increasing prices provide the opportunity for higher sales and increased gross profit, while periods of declining prices may result in declines in sales and profitability. In particular, low market prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in market prices. For further discussion of the impact of commodity prices on historical periods, see -Operating Results.\u201d\nConsolidation of production homebuilders\nOver the past ten years, the homebuilding industry has undergone consolidation and many production homebuilders have increased their market share. We expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. Our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we face in our markets with certain profitability expectations. We expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest production homebuilders will be vital to our ability to expand into new markets as well as grow our market share. While we generate significant sales from these homebuilders, our gross margins on sales to them tend to be lower than our gross margins on sales to other market segments. This could impact our gross margins if the market share held by the largest production homebuilders continues to increase.\nOur ability to control expenses\nWe pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses. We employ a LEAN process operating philosophy, which encourages continuous improvement in our core processes to minimize waste, improve customer service, increase expense productivity, improve working capital and maximize profitability and cash flow. We regularly analyze our workforce productivity to achieve the optimum, cost-efficient labor mix for our facilities. Further, we pay careful attention to our logistics function and have implemented GPS-enabled telematics technology across our delivery fleet to improve customer service, driver safety and the productivity of our shipping and handling costs.\nMix of products sold\nWe typically realize greater gross margins on more highly engineered and customized products, or ancillary products that are often purchased based on convenience and are therefore less price sensitive to our customers. For example, sales of lumber & lumber sheet goods tend to generate lower gross margins due to their commodity nature and the relatively low switching costs of sourcing those products from different suppliers. Structural components and millwork, doors & windows often generate higher gross margins relative to other products. Homebuilders often use structural components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. We believe shortening cycle time from start to completion is a key goal of homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand or limited availability of framing labor. As the residential new construction market continues to strengthen, we expect the use of structural components by homebuilders to increase.\nChanges in customer sales mix\nOur operating results may vary according to the amount and type of products we sell to each of our primary customer types: new single-family homebuilders, professional remodeling contractors, and multi-family builders and light commercial builders. The following table reflects our estimate of net sales by each customer type. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family homebuilders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,523,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,262,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,258,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional remodeling contractors\n</td> <td>379,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (including multi-family & light commercial builders)\n</td> <td>462,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,365,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,093,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,576,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe tend to realize higher gross margins on sales to remodeling contractors due to the smaller product volumes purchased by those customers, as well as the more customized nature of the projects those customers generally undertake. Gross margins on sales to single-family, multi-family and light commercial customers can vary based on a variety of factors, including the purchase volumes of the individual customer, the mix of products sold to that customer, the size and selling price of the project being constructed and the number of upgrades added to the project before or during its construction.\nFreight costs and fuel charges\nA portion of our shipping and handling costs is comprised of diesel and other fuels purchased for our delivery fleet and handling equipment. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average retail price per gallon for No. 2 diesel fuel was $2.65, $2.31 and $2.71 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred costs of approximately $14.8 million within selling, general and administrative expenses for diesel and other fuels used for our delivery fleet and handling equipment. Future increases in the cost of fuel, or inbound freight costs for the products we purchase, could impact our operating results and cash flows if we are unable to pass along these cost increases to our customers through increased prices.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth our operating results in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\nTable 99:

increased $272.2 million, or 8.8%, to $3,366.0 million from $3,093.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of commodity price inflation of approximately 4.2% and increased volume of approximately 2.8% related to existing operations, while the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly increased net sales by approximately 1.8%.\nWe estimate approximately 75% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were to customers engaged in new single-family construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, increased approximately 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year, while single-family houses completed increased 8.7% during the same time period. Increases in net sales from Texas and California accounted for approximately 42% of the total increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, while the Company experienced a decrease in net sales in Georgia of less than 1% of overall net sales.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $2.9 million of expense incurred in relation to the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger. We estimate our cost of sales increased approximately 5.0% as a result of commodity cost inflation, 2.8% as a result of increased sales volumes related to existing operations and 1.6% related to the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly, partially offset by a 0.1% decrease as a result of the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value.\nGross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $53.6 million, or 7.2%, to $795.5 million from $742.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by increased sales volumes and commodity price inflation. Our gross margin was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decline resulted primarily from a decline in gross margin in lumber & lumber sheet goods and structural components and a greater percentage of total net sales derived from lumber & lumber sheet goods, which generally generate lower margins. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by $2.9 million, or 0.1% of net sales, in relation to the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger.\nOperating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million, or 8.4%, to $619.5 million, or 18.4% of net sales, from $571.8 million, or 18.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $16.5 million of this increase related to increased shipping and handling costs to serve higher sales volumes related to existing operations, $12.5 million related to selling, general and administrative expenses of TexPly and Code Plus, $5.6 million related to an increase in the provision for workers' compensation claims and $5.5 million related to increased health care costs. The remaining increase was primarily due to costs associated with five newly-opened facilities of approximately $4.7 million. \n \u2022 depreciation expense increased $4.6 million, or 11.9%, to $43.0 million from $38.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase primarily relates to replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment. \n \u2022 amortization expense was $16.0 million compared to $20.7 million in the prior year. This decrease resulted from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in 2016, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Code Plus and TexPly acquisitions. \n \u2022 the Company incurred $15.3 million of Merger and integration costs related to the ongoing integration of BMHC and SBS, consisting primarily of severance, system integration costs and professional fees compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $2.8 million of expense related to the discontinuance of the new third-party software BMHC selected in 2013 for its planned Enterprise Resource Planning system (\"New ERP\") (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP). \n \u2022 the Company recognized asset impairment charges of $0.4 million related to the write down of real estate held for sale to the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company decided to integrate all operations under the ERP system utilized by Legacy SBS, and to discontinue use of the New ERP (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP). In connection with this decision, the Company impaired capitalized software costs that had previously been recorded as construction-in-progress within property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. \nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense was $25.0 million compared to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease relates primarily to reduced average borrowings under the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement (the \"Revolver\") and a decrease in interest expense on the Senior Notes after the Company redeemed $250.0 million of 9.0% senior secured notes (the \"Extinguished Senior Notes\") with the proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes during September 2016. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, was $1.7 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the Extinguished Senior Notes. The loss is made up of a call premium of $8.4 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $4.1 million. There were no similar costs in 2017.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income, net was $5.7 million, which consisted primarily of income related to the final settlement of insurance claims made by the Company for a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015, income from tax incentive programs and service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other income, net was $4.1 million, which consisted primarily of insurance proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015 and service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable.\nIncome tax\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, income tax expense was $24.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.8% compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, an Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") section 199 manufacturing deduction, and excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions. Excluding the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been 34.2%. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a net income tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2017 primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the adoption of a state tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on a state net operating loss carryforward, excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, and an IRC section 199 manufacturing deduction.\nThe Company expects our 2018 annual effective tax rate to be lower than our current year effective tax rate primarily due to a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. In addition to the lower corporate income tax rate, other tax law changes related to the 2017 Tax Act that may impact our Company's tax provision in subsequent years include, but are not limited to, the acceleration of tax depreciation for certain assets, repeal of the section 199 manufacturing deduction, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased $1,517.0 million, or 96.2%, to $3,093.7 million from $1,576.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by increased volume of approximately 6.3% related to existing operations and 88.7% related to the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, while the impact of commodity price inflation increased net sales by approximately 1.2%.\nWe estimate approximately 73% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were to customers engaged in new single-family construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, increased approximately 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, while single-family houses completed increased 13.6% during the same time period.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category.

We estimate our cost of sales increased approximately 92.1% as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, while organic change accounted for an increase of 1.4%. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes $2.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of expense incurred in relation to the sell-through of Legacy SBS inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger.\nGross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit increased $380.6 million, or 105.3%, to $742.0 million from $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven primarily by the Merger and the acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as well as increased sales volumes. Our gross margin was 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a higher percentage of total net sales being derived from millwork, doors & windows, which generally are sold at a higher gross margin than our other product categories, as well as increased consideration from supplier agreements.\nOperating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $265.0 million, or 86.3%, to $571.8 million, or 18.5% of net sales, from $306.8 million, or 19.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI. \n \u2022 depreciation expense increased $22.7 million, or 144.8%, to $38.4 million from $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of fixed assets acquired through the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as well as replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment. \n \u2022 amortization expense was $20.7 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. The amortization expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to intangible assets acquired through the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI. \n \u2022 the Company recognized asset impairment charges of $11.9 million. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company decided to integrate all operations under the Legacy SBS ERP system, and to discontinue use of the New ERP (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP). In connection with this decision, the Company impaired capitalized software costs that had previously been recorded as construction-in-progress within property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. \n \u2022 the Company incurred $15.3 million of Merger and integration costs related to the ongoing integration of BMHC and SBS, consisting primarily of severance, system integration costs and professional fees compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $30.1 million compared to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase relates primarily to SBS borrowings that were assumed by the Company as of the date of the Merger and borrowings used to fund the acquisition of RBI. This increase was partially offset by reduced borrowing levels on the Revolver after repaying approximately $74 million of Revolver borrowings from proceeds received from the Company's refinancing of its Senior Notes in September 2016. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, was $3.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the Extinguished Senior Notes. The loss is made up of a call premium of $8.4 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $4.1 million.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income, net increased $3.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $1.9 million of this increase was due to insurance proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015. The remaining increase relates primarily to service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable for Legacy SBS operations.\nIncome tax\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, income tax expense was $14.3 million compared to income tax benefit of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 31.6% compared to 66.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the adoption of a state tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on a state net operating loss carryforward, excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, and an IRC section 199 manufacturing deduction. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate was higher than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to adopting a tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and other built-in losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments and fund capital expenditures. During 2017 and 2016, our capital resources have primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents generated through operating cash flows, proceeds from the September 2016 issuance of the Senior Notes and borrowings under our Revolver.\nOur liquidity at December 31, 2017 was $320.0 million, which includes $11.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $308.2 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Revolver.\nWe believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next 12 months.\nHistorical Cash Flow Information\nNet current assets\nNet current assets (current assets less current liabilities) were $418.9 million and $364.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net of allowances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(307,538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(291,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,739\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable, net, increased $9.6 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in sales, partially offset by a decrease in days sales outstanding (measured against net sales in the fourth quarter of each period), which were 38 days at December 31, 2016 and 35 days at December 31, 2017.\nInventories, net, increased $36.8 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to commodity price inflation and increases in sales. Inventory days on hand (measured against cost of sales in the fourth quarter of each period) were 43 days at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased $15.9 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable related to increased inventory purchases in connection with higher sales volume.\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $93.9 million, $106.9 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,831\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in working capital and other assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,792\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily related to an increase in cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, of $14.6 million, which resulted from an increase in taxable income and the utilization during the year ended December 31, 2016 of income tax overpayments made during the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in other assets and liabilities relate primarily to the timing of cash received from customers and cash paid to vendors.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $106.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily related to improved profitability and the effects of the Merger, whereby the year ended December 31, 2016 contains a full year of Legacy SBS cash flows, while the year ended December 31, 2015 only contains the cash flows of Legacy SBS beginning on the date that the Merger was completed, December 1, 2015.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $88.3 million, $33.7 million and $135.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, equipment and real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(149,485\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of property, equipment and real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in restricted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(88,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(135,076\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used for the purchase of property, equipment and real estate for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from the purchase of vehicles and equipment to support increased sales volume and replace aged assets, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. Proceeds from the sale of property, equipment and real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017 relates primarily to the sale of real estate of $12.7 million.\nPurchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, for the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly and for the year ended December 31, 2015, relate to the acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as discussed in \"Factors Affecting our Operating Results\" above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received insurance proceeds related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015, of which $1.2 million related to property, plant and equipment damaged in the fire.\nDuring 2013, BMHC deposited $46.4 million in a separate bank account to collateralize letters of credit related to insurance claims for periods prior to January 2010. During 2015, BMHC was able to release the majority of these amounts into unrestricted cash as a result of reductions in claims and the transfer of the risk of loss of certain claims to a reinsurer in January 2015. In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into on December 1, 2015, the Company was able to release the remaining cash collateral into unrestricted cash.\nCash acquired in the Merger of $6.3 million represents cash and cash equivalents of SBS on the closing date of the Merger.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(2.8) million, $(65.3) million and $72.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds from (repayments of) Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(152,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments on capital leases and other notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of Extinguished Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(250,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments of debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings under other notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other financing activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(687\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had proceeds from the Revolver, net of repayments, of $4.5 million. The Company made net repayments of $152.3 million on the Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $74 million of this repayment was funded through net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes issuance, after payment of accrued interest, debt issuance costs and the call premium. Proceeds from the Revolver, net of repayments, of $84.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates primarily to amounts borrowed to purchase RBI in September 2015, as well as purchases of property and equipment.\nPayments on capital leases and other notes increased during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to new financing of handling equipment to support higher sales volumes as well as one-time payments made during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the payoff of certain other notes.\nDuring September 2016, the Company completed an issuance of $350.0 million of Senior Notes and utilized a portion of the cash proceeds from the issuance to redeem in full the $250.0 million Extinguished Senior Notes. The Company incurred $6.7 million of debt issuance costs related to the Senior Notes, and paid a call premium of $8.4 million related to the Extinguished Senior Notes. The debt issuance costs incurred during 2015 relate primarily to third-party and lender costs incurred in relation to the Credit Agreement.\nDuring May 2016, the Company commenced a public offering of 5,700,000 shares of its common stock by certain stockholders. In connection with the offering, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 855,000 shares of common stock. The underwriters exercised this option, which generated gross proceeds of $14.5 million and net proceeds of $13.8 million, after subtracting $0.7 million of underwriting commissions and other fees.\nBorrowings under other notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 relate to notes secured by certain operating equipment. No such borrowings were made during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options, which are included in other financing activities, net, were $3.4 million, $1.3 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other financing activities, net also includes net activity related to secured borrowings and purchases of treasury stock in connection with shares withheld on vesting and exercises of equity awards.\nCapital expenditures\nCapital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures, including the incurrence of capital lease obligations and net of proceeds from the sale of property, equipment and real estate to be approximately $55.0 million to $65.0 million primarily related to vehicles and equipment, including lease buyouts, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. We are still evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our level of capital expenditures, which may incentivize us to increase our level of capital spending during 2018.\nSenior secured notes\nOn September 15, 2016, the Company issued $350.0 million of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2024 and are secured by a first priority lien on certain assets of the Company and a second priority lien on the collateral that secures the Credit Agreement, which collectively approximates substantially all assets of the Company. The interest rate is fixed at 5.5% and is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1. The Indenture contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including restrictions on new indebtedness, issuance of liens and guarantees, investments, distributions to equityholders, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Senior Notes were issued by BMC East, LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, and are guaranteed by the Company and the other subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. Each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, and all guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture as of December 31, 2017.\nRevolving credit agreement\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the Merger, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which includes the Revolver, has an aggregate commitment of $375.0 million and a letters of credit sublimit of $100.0 million. The Revolver matures at the earlier of (i) December 1, 2020 and (ii) the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the Senior Notes, or if the Senior Notes are refinanced or repaid, the date that is three months prior to the new maturity date of the replacement notes or other indebtedness\nthat replaced or refinanced the Senior Notes. The Revolver is subject to an asset-based borrowing formula on eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables and inventory, in each case reduced by certain reserves.\nBorrowings under the Revolver bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (which means the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.0% or (iii) the prime rate) plus a Base Rate Margin (which ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% based on Revolver availability) or LIBOR plus a LIBOR Rate Margin (which ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% based on Revolver availability).The fee on any outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolver ranges from 0.75% to 1.25%, depending on whether the letters of credit are fully cash collateralized. The fee on the unused portion of the Revolver is 0.25%.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including restrictions on new indebtedness, issuance of liens, investments, distributions to equityholders, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00:1:00, as defined therein. However, the covenant is only applicable if excess availability under the Credit Agreement is less than or equal to the greater of (i) $33.3 million and (ii) 10% of the line cap, and remains in effect until excess availability has been greater than the greater of (i) $33.3 million and (ii) 10% of the line cap for 30 consecutive days. While there can be no assurances, based upon our forecast, we do not expect the financial covenant to become applicable during the year ended December 31, 2018. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in certain accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets of the Company and a second-priority security interest in substantially all other assets of the Company that secure the Senior Notes on a first-priority basis.\nWe had outstanding borrowings of $4.5 million with net availability of $308.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017, all of which were Base Rate borrowings, was 4.75%. We had $62.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table. We have not included liabilities related to self-insurance reserves in the table below, as these reserves represent an estimate of our future obligations and do not represent cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business and commitments that are cancellable on 30 days' notice are excluded from the table below. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term debt (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents principal of $350.0 million and semi-annual interest payments at a 5.5% interest rate. The Senior Notes mature in October 2024. For further information, refer to Note 9 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Represents principal of $4.5 million and interest payments of $0.6 million, based on outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect under the Revolver as of December 31, 2017. To the extent that a decrease in eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables and inventory reduces the maximum availability under the Revolver below the amount then outstanding, amounts outstanding could become due sooner than reflected in the table. The Revolver matures at the earlier of December 1, 2020 or the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the Senior Notes. For purposes of this table, as the Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2024, we have assumed a maturity date of December 1, 2020. For further information, refer to Note 9 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (3) Represents payments under our capital leases for real estate, fleet vehicles and various equipment. For further information, refer to Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (4) Represents payments under our operating leases, primarily for buildings, improvements and equipment. For further information, refer to Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (5) Consists primarily of obligations to purchase vehicles which are enforceable and legally binding on us. Excludes purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are short-term or cancellable. (6) Represents payments on a term note secured by real property which matures in February 2021. The interest rate is 7.0%. For further information, refer to Note 9 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, other than operating leases described above and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities.\nSeasonality and Other Factors\nOur first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. In addition, quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following:\n \u2022 the volatility of lumber prices; \n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry; \n \u2022 general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete; \n \u2022 the pricing policies of our competitors; \n \u2022 the production schedules of our customers; and \n \u2022 the effects of weather. \nThe composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables, although this is generally offset in part by higher trade payables to our suppliers. Working capital levels typically increase in the second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction season. These increases have in the past resulted in negative operating cash flows during this peak season, which historically have been financed through available cash or excess availability on our Revolver. Collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season have in the past positively impacted cash flow. In the past, we have also utilized our borrowing availability under credit facilities to cover working capital needs.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our audited financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, actual results may be materially different from the estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue for sales of building products when products are delivered and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. All sales recognized are net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns, based on historical experience. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions are excluded from sales.\nThe percentage-of-completion method is used to recognize revenue for construction services. Periodic estimates of progress towards completion are made based on either a comparison of labor costs incurred to date with total estimated contract labor costs or total costs incurred to date with total estimated contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method requires the use of various estimates, including among others, the extent of progress towards completion, contract revenues and contract completion costs. Contract revenues and contract costs to be recognized are dependent on the accuracy of estimates, including quantities of materials, labor productivity and other cost estimates. The Company has a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards\ncompletion, contract revenues and contract completion costs. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual contract revenues and completion costs may vary from estimates.\nEstimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates reflect the Company's best estimate of probable losses of unbilled receivables, and are recognized in the period such revisions are known and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are recognized in cost of sales. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates are established by assessing estimated costs to complete, change orders and claims for uncompleted contracts. Assumptions for estimated costs to complete include material prices, labor costs, labor productivity and contract claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and therefore it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from these estimates.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), including subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model requiring companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate\u201d as it involves judgments about our customers' ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an assessment of individual past due accounts, historical write-off experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes and the business environment. Account balances are charged off when the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nManagement believes the allowance amounts recorded, in each instance, represent its best estimate of future outcomes. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of materials purchased for resale, including lumber and sheet goods, millwork, doors and windows as well as certain manufactured products, and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all of our inventories is determined by the weighted average cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out approach. We evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This evaluation includes an analysis of historical physical inventory results, a review of potential excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory aging and anticipated future demand. At least quarterly, each branch's perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect any declines in net realizable value below inventory carrying cost. To the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact, either favorably or unfavorably, the salability of our products or our relationships with certain key suppliers, our inventory reserves could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions.\nBusiness combinations\nFor all acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Management makes significant estimates and assumptions when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates include, but are not limited to, discount rates, projected future net sales, projected future expected cash flows and useful lives. When necessary, we will engage third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities.\nValuation of goodwill, long-lived assets and amortizable other intangible assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, purchased intangible assets and goodwill. The valuation and the impairment testing of these long-lived assets involve significant judgments and assumptions, particularly as they relate to the identification of reporting units, asset groups and the determination of fair market value.\nWe test our tangible and intangible long-lived assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur indicating that there may be impairment.\nWe have recorded goodwill and perform testing for potential goodwill impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is available, and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Additionally, components within an operating segment are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Beginning January 1, 2017, following the realignment of certain markets which resulted in the consolidation of the Company's historical Mountain West division into the Intermountain division, the Company's five operating segments, which have been determined to be the Company's reporting units, are the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Texas, Intermountain and Western divisions. Following the realignment, the chief operating decision maker continues to review aggregate information to allocate resources and assess performance. Based on this, as well as the similar economic characteristics, nature of products, distribution methods and customers of the divisions both before and after the realignment, the Company has aggregated its operating segments into one reportable segment. We complete our annual impairment assessment during the third quarter of each year. We did not recognize any impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nFor impairment testing of long-lived assets, we identify asset groups at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAs discussed above, changes in management intentions, market events or conditions, projected future net sales, operating results, cash flow of our reporting units and other similar circumstances could affect the assumptions used in the impairment tests. Although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and other long-lived assets are reasonable, differences between actual and expected net sales, operating results and cash flow could cause these assets to be impaired. If any asset were determined to be impaired, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, but not our cash flow from operations.\nStock based compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted restricted stock unit awards and performance restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and directors.\nWe account for restricted stock unit awards by recording compensation expense over the requisite service period, using graded vesting, based on the award's fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards is based on the price of our publicly traded common stock at the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards with performance conditions, we record compensation expense based on the expected number of units that will vest, which is adjusted, as appropriate, throughout the performance period.\nWe account for stock options granted to employees by recording compensation expense based on the award's fair value, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses inputs including the fair value per share of our common stock, volatility, expected term of the awards, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, based on management's judgment and subjective future expectations. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation recorded for future awards may differ materially from that recorded for awards granted previously.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nCasualty and health insurance\nWe carry insurance for general liability, auto liability and workers' compensation exposures subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we self-insure for employee and eligible dependent health care claims, with insurance purchased from independent carriers to cover individual claims in excess of the self-insured limits. The expected liability for unpaid claims, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined using the assistance of third-party actuaries and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability with current and long-term components. We have elected not to discount this liability. The amount recoverable from insurance providers is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Our accounting policy includes an internal evaluation and adjustment of our reserve for all insured losses on a quarterly basis. At least on an annual basis, we engage external actuarial professionals to independently assess and estimate the total liability outstanding, which is compared to the actual reserve balance at that time and adjusted accordingly.\nIncome taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The primary negative evidence considered includes the cumulative operating losses generated in prior periods. The primary positive evidence considered includes recent prior periods with cumulative operating income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization that would occur within the same jurisdiction and during the carry-forward period necessary to absorb the state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2017, the Company evaluated the positive and negative evidence in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2017, we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, net of a state tax valuation allowance of $0.1 million.\nASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and certain measurement principles for the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on an income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties associated with income taxes, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition requirements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognizes no material uncertain tax positions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the 2017 Tax Act. This legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from a maximum 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. The Company has recognized the net tax benefit of $3.6 million related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included this amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, on a provisional basis based on information currently available. The 2017 Tax Act may be subject to technical amendments, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, any of which could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation. As such, we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period ending no later than December 2018.\nConsideration received from suppliers\nWe enter into arrangements with many of our suppliers providing for inventory purchase rebates ( supplier rebates\u201d) upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels. We accrue estimated supplier rebates monthly as part of cost of goods sold based on progress toward earning the supplier rebates, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through the end of the year. We estimate the rebates applicable to inventory on-hand at each period end based on the inventory turns of the related items.\nUnder certain circumstances, including if market conditions were to change, suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs. Although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to product already purchased, it may impact our gross margins in future periods.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nOn December 1, 2015, SBS completed the Merger with privately-held BMHC in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS. SBS survived the Merger and in connection therewith changed its name to BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\u201d The financial statements represent the financial statements of BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the Merger was treated as a reverse merger\u201d under the acquisition method of accounting. For accounting purposes, BMHC is considered to have acquired SBS. Consequently, the historical financial statements of the Company reflect only the operations and financial condition of BMHC prior to the Merger. The operating results of SBS are included as part of the Company's reported results beginning on the closing date of the Merger.\nWe are one of the leading providers of diversified building products and services in the U.S. residential construction market. Our objective is to provide best-in-class customer service and value-added products to our customers, which are primarily single- and multi-family home builders and professional remodelers. Our product offerings include lumber and lumber sheet goods and an array of value-added products including millwork, doors, windows and structural components such as EWP, floor and roof trusses and wall panels. Our whole-house framing solution, Ready-Frame\u00ae, which is one of our fastest growing product offerings, saves builders both time and money and improves job site safety. We also offer our customers important services such as design, product specification, installation and installation management.\nAs part of our initiatives to execute our strategic plan, including growing our value-added product and service offerings and expanding our presence in the professional remodeling space, we plan to expand our business through organic and acquisitive means. The 18 states in which we operate accounted for approximately 65% of 2017 U.S. single-family housing permits according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In these 18 states, we operate in 43 metropolitan areas, which accounted for approximately half of the permits issued in those states, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, providing significant opportunity for growth.\nOur net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 8.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We estimate net sales increased 2.8% due to organic sales volume, 1.8% due to the acquisitions of Code Plus Components, LLC (\"Code Plus\") and Texas Plywood & Lumber Company, Inc. (\"TexPly\") and 4.2% due to commodity price inflation. Our gross margin was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 24.0% for the prior year period. We recorded income from operations of $101.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $83.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. See further discussion in -Operating Results\u201d below.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including, among others, acquisitions, conditions in the housing market and economic conditions generally, changes in the cost of the products we sell (particularly commodity products), pricing policies of our competitors, production schedules of our customers and seasonality. Some of the more important factors are briefly discussed below.\nMerger and acquisitions\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of TexPly, a supplier of production millwork and doors in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for a purchase price of $31.7 million, including the purchase of real estate.\nOn March 27, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Code Plus, a truss manufacturer located in Martinsburg, West Virginia serving the Washington DC market, for a purchase price of $7.1 million.\nAs discussed above, on December 1, 2015, SBS completed the Merger with privately-held BMHC in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which BMHC merged with and into SBS.\nOn September 1, 2015, BMHC purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Marietta, Georgia-based Robert Bowden Inc. (\"RBI\") for a purchase price of $102.4 million. RBI has three locations in the Atlanta, Georgia area and sells millwork and window products to homebuilders and residential contractors.\nOn May 1, 2015, BMHC completed the acquisition of Vidalia, Georgia-based VNS Corporation (\"VNS\") for a purchase price of $47.1 million. VNS has nine locations in southern Georgia and sells building materials and provides construction services in the southeastern United States.\nNet sales increased by approximately $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the acquisitions of TexPly and Code Plus. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased by approximately $1.4 billion as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of RBI and VNS.\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our acquisitions.\nConditions in the housing and construction market\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly dependent on new single-family home and multi-family construction and repair and remodeling activity, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including, among other things, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, wage rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing, the availability of qualified trade laborers, the health of the economy and mortgage markets and the availability of personal income tax deductions related to home ownership, some of which were limited by the 2017 Tax Act. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, were 0.55 million, 0.60 million and 0.66 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of November 2017, Dodge Data & Analytics (formerly McGraw-Hill) forecasted that U.S. single-family housing starts will increase approximately 7% in 2018. Additionally, the S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a leading measure of pricing for the U.S. residential housing market, has increased on a year-over-year basis for 67 straight months as of November 2017 and in November 2017, the index reached its highest levels ever.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, multi-family housing starts in the United States reached a low of 0.11 million in 2009, but reached levels of 0.40 million, 0.39 million and 0.35 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. While this end market has receded since 2015, the multi-family space represents a significant opportunity for us to capture additional market share and provide value-added solutions.\nThe professional remodeling space, when compared to new home construction, tends to be less price sensitive and more resilient to broader economic conditions. As of September 2017, the Home Improvement Research Institute estimated 2017 and 2018 U.S. sales of home maintenance, repair and improvement products to the professional market would reach approximately $103 billion and $106 billion, respectively, compared to sales of approximately $94 billion and $100 billion in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Several factors, including the overall age of the U.S. housing stock, rising home prices, availability of consumer capital at historically low interest rates and focus on energy efficiency may drive long-term growth in repair and remodeling expenditures.\nOverall economic conditions in the markets where we operate\nEconomic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business. We believe continued strong employment levels, access to financing and strong consumer confidence will be necessary to increase household formation rates. We believe improved household formation rates in turn will increase demand for housing and stimulate new construction.\nCommodity nature of our products\nMany of the building products we distribute, including lumber, OSB, plywood and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently based on participants' perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors.\nThe following table reflects changes in the average composite framing lumber prices (per thousand board feet) and average composite structural panel prices (per thousand square feet). These prices represent transactions between manufacturers and their customers as reported by Random Lengths and may differ in magnitude or timing from the actual selling prices or cost of goods reported in our operating results. The average composite structural panel prices are based on index prices for OSB and plywood.\n\nPeriods of increasing prices provide the opportunity for higher sales and increased gross profit, while periods of declining prices may result in declines in sales and profitability. In particular, low market prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in market prices. For further discussion of the impact of commodity prices on historical periods, see -Operating Results.\u201d\nConsolidation of production homebuilders\nOver the past ten years, the homebuilding industry has undergone consolidation and many production homebuilders have increased their market share. We expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. Our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we face in our markets with certain profitability expectations. We expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest production homebuilders will be vital to our ability to expand into new markets as well as grow our market share. While we generate significant sales from these homebuilders, our gross margins on sales to them tend to be lower than our gross margins on sales to other market segments. This could impact our gross margins if the market share held by the largest production homebuilders continues to increase.\nOur ability to control expenses\nWe pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses. We employ a LEAN process operating philosophy, which encourages continuous improvement in our core processes to minimize waste, improve customer service, increase expense productivity, improve working capital and maximize profitability and cash flow. We regularly analyze our workforce productivity to achieve the optimum, cost-efficient labor mix for our facilities. Further, we pay careful attention to our logistics function and have implemented GPS-enabled telematics technology across our delivery fleet to improve customer service, driver safety and the productivity of our shipping and handling costs.\nMix of products sold\nWe typically realize greater gross margins on more highly engineered and customized products, or ancillary products that are often purchased based on convenience and are therefore less price sensitive to our customers. For example, sales of lumber & lumber sheet goods tend to generate lower gross margins due to their commodity nature and the relatively low switching costs of sourcing those products from different suppliers. Structural components and millwork, doors & windows often generate higher gross margins relative to other products. Homebuilders often use structural components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. We believe shortening cycle time from start to completion is a key goal of homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand or limited availability of framing labor. As the residential new construction market continues to strengthen, we expect the use of structural components by homebuilders to increase.\nChanges in customer sales mix\nOur operating results may vary according to the amount and type of products we sell to each of our primary customer types: new single-family homebuilders, professional remodeling contractors, and multi-family builders and light commercial builders. The following table reflects our estimate of net sales by each customer type. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nWe tend to realize higher gross margins on sales to remodeling contractors due to the smaller product volumes purchased by those customers, as well as the more customized nature of the projects those customers generally undertake. Gross margins on sales to single-family, multi-family and light commercial customers can vary based on a variety of factors, including the purchase volumes of the individual customer, the mix of products sold to that customer, the size and selling price of the project being constructed and the number of upgrades added to the project before or during its construction.\nFreight costs and fuel charges\nA portion of our shipping and handling costs is comprised of diesel and other fuels purchased for our delivery fleet and handling equipment. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average retail price per gallon for No. 2 diesel fuel was $2.65, $2.31 and $2.71 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred costs of approximately $14.8 million within selling, general and administrative expenses for diesel and other fuels used for our delivery fleet and handling equipment. Future increases in the cost of fuel, or inbound freight costs for the products we purchase, could impact our operating results and cash flows if we are unable to pass along these cost increases to our customers through increased prices.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth our operating results in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\n\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales increased $272.2 million, or 8.8%, to $3,366.0 million from $3,093.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of commodity price inflation of approximately 4.2% and increased volume of approximately 2.8% related to existing operations, while the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly increased net sales by approximately 1.8%.\nWe estimate approximately 75% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were to customers engaged in new single-family construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, increased approximately 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year, while single-family houses completed increased 8.7% during the same time period. Increases in net sales from Texas and California accounted for approximately 42% of the total increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, while the Company experienced a decrease in net sales in Georgia of less than 1% of overall net sales.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. \nThe impact of commodity price inflation during the year ended December 31, 2017 contributed to the increase in net sales in our lumber & lumber sheet goods and structural components product categories.\nCost of sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of sales increased $218.7 million, or 9.3%, to $2,570.5 million from $2,351.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $2.9 million of expense incurred in relation to the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger. We estimate our cost of sales increased approximately 5.0% as a result of commodity cost inflation, 2.8% as a result of increased sales volumes related to existing operations and 1.6% related to the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly, partially offset by a 0.1% decrease as a result of the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value.\nGross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $53.6 million, or 7.2%, to $795.5 million from $742.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by increased sales volumes and commodity price inflation. Our gross margin was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decline resulted primarily from a decline in gross margin in lumber & lumber sheet goods and structural components and a greater percentage of total net sales derived from lumber & lumber sheet goods, which generally generate lower margins. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by $2.9 million, or 0.1% of net sales, in relation to the sell-through of inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger.\nOperating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million, or 8.4%, to $619.5 million, or 18.4% of net sales, from $571.8 million, or 18.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $16.5 million of this increase related to increased shipping and handling costs to serve higher sales volumes related to existing operations, $12.5 million related to selling, general and administrative expenses of TexPly and Code Plus, $5.6 million related to an increase in the provision for workers' compensation claims and $5.5 million related to increased health care costs. The remaining increase was primarily due to costs associated with five newly-opened facilities of approximately $4.7 million. \n \u2022 depreciation expense increased $4.6 million, or 11.9%, to $43.0 million from $38.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase primarily relates to replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment. \n \u2022 amortization expense was $16.0 million compared to $20.7 million in the prior year. This decrease resulted from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in 2016, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Code Plus and TexPly acquisitions. \n \u2022 the Company incurred $15.3 million of Merger and integration costs related to the ongoing integration of BMHC and SBS, consisting primarily of severance, system integration costs and professional fees compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $2.8 million of expense related to the discontinuance of the new third-party software BMHC selected in 2013 for its planned Enterprise Resource Planning system (\"New ERP\") (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP). \n \u2022 the Company recognized asset impairment charges of $0.4 million related to the write down of real estate held for sale to the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company decided to integrate all operations under the ERP system utilized by Legacy SBS, and to discontinue use of the New ERP (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP). In connection with this decision, the Company impaired capitalized software costs that had previously been recorded as construction-in-progress within property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. \nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense was $25.0 million compared to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease relates primarily to reduced average borrowings under the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement (the \"Revolver\") and a decrease in interest expense on the Senior Notes after the Company redeemed $250.0 million of 9.0% senior secured notes (the \"Extinguished Senior Notes\") with the proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes during September 2016. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, was $1.7 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the Extinguished Senior Notes. The loss is made up of a call premium of $8.4 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $4.1 million. There were no similar costs in 2017.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income, net was $5.7 million, which consisted primarily of income related to the final settlement of insurance claims made by the Company for a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015, income from tax incentive programs and service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other income, net was $4.1 million, which consisted primarily of insurance proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015 and service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable.\nIncome tax\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, income tax expense was $24.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.8% compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, an Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") section 199 manufacturing deduction, and excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions. Excluding the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been 34.2%. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a net income tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2017 primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the adoption of a state tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on a state net operating loss carryforward, excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, and an IRC section 199 manufacturing deduction.\nThe Company expects our 2018 annual effective tax rate to be lower than our current year effective tax rate primarily due to a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. In addition to the lower corporate income tax rate, other tax law changes related to the 2017 Tax Act that may impact our Company's tax provision in subsequent years include, but are not limited to, the acceleration of tax depreciation for certain assets, repeal of the section 199 manufacturing deduction, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased $1,517.0 million, or 96.2%, to $3,093.7 million from $1,576.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by increased volume of approximately 6.3% related to existing operations and 88.7% related to the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, while the impact of commodity price inflation increased net sales by approximately 1.2%.\nWe estimate approximately 73% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were to customers engaged in new single-family construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family housing starts in the South and West regions of the United States, which are our primary operating regions, increased approximately 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, while single-family houses completed increased 13.6% during the same time period.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nCost of sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of sales increased $1,136.4 million, or 93.5%, to $2,351.8 million from $1,215.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We estimate our cost of sales increased approximately 92.1% as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, while organic change accounted for an increase of 1.4%. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes $2.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of expense incurred in relation to the sell-through of Legacy SBS inventory which was stepped up in value in connection with the Merger.\nGross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit increased $380.6 million, or 105.3%, to $742.0 million from $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven primarily by the Merger and the acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as well as increased sales volumes. Our gross margin was 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a higher percentage of total net sales being derived from millwork, doors & windows, which generally are sold at a higher gross margin than our other product categories, as well as increased consideration from supplier agreements.\nOperating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $265.0 million, or 86.3%, to $571.8 million, or 18.5% of net sales, from $306.8 million, or 19.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI. \n \u2022 depreciation expense increased $22.7 million, or 144.8%, to $38.4 million from $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of fixed assets acquired through the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as well as replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment. \n \u2022 amortization expense was $20.7 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. The amortization expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to intangible assets acquired through the Merger and acquisitions of VNS and RBI. \n \u2022 the Company recognized asset impairment charges of $11.9 million. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company decided to integrate all operations under the Legacy SBS ERP system, and to discontinue use of the New ERP (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of the New ERP). In connection with this decision, the Company impaired capitalized software costs that had previously been recorded as construction-in-progress within property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. \n \u2022 the Company incurred $15.3 million of Merger and integration costs related to the ongoing integration of BMHC and SBS, consisting primarily of severance, system integration costs and professional fees compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $30.1 million compared to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase relates primarily to SBS borrowings that were assumed by the Company as of the date of the Merger and borrowings used to fund the acquisition of RBI. This increase was partially offset by reduced borrowing levels on the Revolver after repaying approximately $74 million of Revolver borrowings from proceeds received from the Company's refinancing of its Senior Notes in September 2016. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, was $3.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million related to the redemption of the Extinguished Senior Notes. The loss is made up of a call premium of $8.4 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $4.1 million.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income, net increased $3.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $1.9 million of this increase was due to insurance proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015. The remaining increase relates primarily to service charges assessed on past due accounts receivable for Legacy SBS operations.\nIncome tax\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, income tax expense was $14.3 million compared to income tax benefit of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 31.6% compared to 66.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the adoption of a state tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on a state net operating loss carryforward, excess windfall tax benefits of stock compensation deductions, and an IRC section 199 manufacturing deduction. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate was higher than the Company's federal and state statutory rates primarily due to adopting a tax position related to IRC section 382 limitations on its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and other built-in losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments and fund capital expenditures. During 2017 and 2016, our capital resources have primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents generated through operating cash flows, proceeds from the September 2016 issuance of the Senior Notes and borrowings under our Revolver.\nOur liquidity at December 31, 2017 was $320.0 million, which includes $11.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $308.2 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Revolver.\nWe believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next 12 months.\nHistorical Cash Flow Information\nNet current assets\nNet current assets (current assets less current liabilities) were $418.9 million and $364.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\n\nAccounts receivable, net, increased $9.6 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in sales, partially offset by a decrease in days sales outstanding (measured against net sales in the fourth quarter of each period), which were 38 days at December 31, 2016 and 35 days at December 31, 2017.\nInventories, net, increased $36.8 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to commodity price inflation and increases in sales. Inventory days on hand (measured against cost of sales in the fourth quarter of each period) were 43 days at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased $15.9 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable related to increased inventory purchases in connection with higher sales volume.\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $93.9 million, $106.9 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily related to an increase in cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, of $14.6 million, which resulted from an increase in taxable income and the utilization during the year ended December 31, 2016 of income tax overpayments made during the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in other assets and liabilities relate primarily to the timing of cash received from customers and cash paid to vendors.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $106.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily related to improved profitability and the effects of the Merger, whereby the year ended December 31, 2016 contains a full year of Legacy SBS cash flows, while the year ended December 31, 2015 only contains the cash flows of Legacy SBS beginning on the date that the Merger was completed, December 1, 2015.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $88.3 million, $33.7 million and $135.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\n\nCash used for the purchase of property, equipment and real estate for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from the purchase of vehicles and equipment to support increased sales volume and replace aged assets, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. Proceeds from the sale of property, equipment and real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017 relates primarily to the sale of real estate of $12.7 million.\nPurchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, for the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the acquisitions of Code Plus and TexPly and for the year ended December 31, 2015, relate to the acquisitions of VNS and RBI, as discussed in \"Factors Affecting our Operating Results\" above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received insurance proceeds related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015, of which $1.2 million related to property, plant and equipment damaged in the fire.\nDuring 2013, BMHC deposited $46.4 million in a separate bank account to collateralize letters of credit related to insurance claims for periods prior to January 2010. During 2015, BMHC was able to release the majority of these amounts into unrestricted cash as a result of reductions in claims and the transfer of the risk of loss of certain claims to a reinsurer in January 2015. In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into on December 1, 2015, the Company was able to release the remaining cash collateral into unrestricted cash.\nCash acquired in the Merger of $6.3 million represents cash and cash equivalents of SBS on the closing date of the Merger.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(2.8) million, $(65.3) million and $72.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the following table:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had proceeds from the Revolver, net of repayments, of $4.5 million. The Company made net repayments of $152.3 million on the Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $74 million of this repayment was funded through net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes issuance, after payment of accrued interest, debt issuance costs and the call premium. Proceeds from the Revolver, net of repayments, of $84.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates primarily to amounts borrowed to purchase RBI in September 2015, as well as purchases of property and equipment.\nPayments on capital leases and other notes increased during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to new financing of handling equipment to support higher sales volumes as well as one-time payments made during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the payoff of certain other notes.\nDuring September 2016, the Company completed an issuance of $350.0 million of Senior Notes and utilized a portion of the cash proceeds from the issuance to redeem in full the $250.0 million Extinguished Senior Notes. The Company incurred $6.7 million of debt issuance costs related to the Senior Notes, and paid a call premium of $8.4 million related to the Extinguished Senior Notes. The debt issuance costs incurred during 2015 relate primarily to third-party and lender costs incurred in relation to the Credit Agreement.\nDuring May 2016, the Company commenced a public offering of 5,700,000 shares of its common stock by certain stockholders. In connection with the offering, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 855,000 shares of common stock. The underwriters exercised this option, which generated gross proceeds of $14.5 million and net proceeds of $13.8 million, after subtracting $0.7 million of underwriting commissions and other fees.\nBorrowings under other notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 relate to notes secured by certain operating equipment. No such borrowings were made during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options, which are included in other financing activities, net, were $3.4 million, $1.3 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other financing activities, net also includes net activity related to secured borrowings and purchases of treasury stock in connection with shares withheld on vesting and exercises of equity awards.\nCapital expenditures\nCapital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures, including the incurrence of capital lease obligations and net of proceeds from the sale of property, equipment and real estate to be approximately $55.0 million to $65.0 million primarily related to vehicles and equipment, including lease buyouts, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. We are still evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our level of capital expenditures, which may incentivize us to increase our level of capital spending during 2018.\nSenior secured notes\nOn September 15, 2016, the Company issued $350.0 million of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2024 and are secured by a first priority lien on certain assets of the Company and a second priority lien on the collateral that secures the Credit Agreement, which collectively approximates substantially all assets of the Company. The interest rate is fixed at 5.5% and is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1. The Indenture contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including restrictions on new indebtedness, issuance of liens and guarantees, investments, distributions to equityholders, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Senior Notes were issued by BMC East, LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, and are guaranteed by the Company and the other subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. Each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, and all guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture as of December 31, 2017.\nRevolving credit agreement\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the Merger, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which includes the Revolver, has an aggregate commitment of $375.0 million and a letters of credit sublimit of $100.0 million. The Revolver matures at the earlier of (i) December 1, 2020 and (ii) the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the Senior Notes, or if the Senior Notes are refinanced or repaid, the date that is three months prior to the new maturity date of the replacement notes or other indebtedness\nthat replaced or refinanced the Senior Notes. The Revolver is subject to an asset-based borrowing formula on eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables and inventory, in each case reduced by certain reserves.\nBorrowings under the Revolver bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (which means the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.0% or (iii) the prime rate) plus a Base Rate Margin (which ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% based on Revolver availability) or LIBOR plus a LIBOR Rate Margin (which ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% based on Revolver availability).The fee on any outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolver ranges from 0.75% to 1.25%, depending on whether the letters of credit are fully cash collateralized. The fee on the unused portion of the Revolver is 0.25%.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including restrictions on new indebtedness, issuance of liens, investments, distributions to equityholders, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00:1:00, as defined therein. However, the covenant is only applicable if excess availability under the Credit Agreement is less than or equal to the greater of (i) $33.3 million and (ii) 10% of the line cap, and remains in effect until excess availability has been greater than the greater of (i) $33.3 million and (ii) 10% of the line cap for 30 consecutive days. While there can be no assurances, based upon our forecast, we do not expect the financial covenant to become applicable during the year ended December 31, 2018. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in certain accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets of the Company and a second-priority security interest in substantially all other assets of the Company that secure the Senior Notes on a first-priority basis.\nWe had outstanding borrowings of $4.5 million with net availability of $308.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017, all of which were Base Rate borrowings, was 4.75%. We had $62.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table. We have not included liabilities related to self-insurance reserves in the table below, as these reserves represent an estimate of our future obligations and do not represent cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business and commitments that are cancellable on 30 days' notice are excluded from the table below. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\n (1) Represents principal of $350.0 million and semi-annual interest payments at a 5.5% interest rate. The Senior Notes mature in October 2024. For further information, refer to Note 9 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Represents principal of $4.5 million and interest payments of $0.6 million, based on outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect under the Revolver as of December 31, 2017. To the extent that a decrease in eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables and inventory reduces the maximum availability under the Revolver below the amount then outstanding, amounts outstanding could become due sooner than reflected in the table. The Revolver matures at the earlier of December 1, 2020 or the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the Senior Notes. For purposes of this table, as the Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2024, we have assumed a maturity date of December 1, 2020. For further information, refer to Note 9 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (3) Represents payments under our capital leases for real estate, fleet vehicles and various equipment. For further information, refer to Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (4) Represents payments under our operating leases, primarily for buildings, improvements and equipment. For further information, refer to Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (5) Consists primarily of obligations to purchase vehicles which are enforceable and legally binding on us. Excludes purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are short-term or cancellable. (6) Represents payments on a term note secured by real property which matures in February 2021. The interest rate is 7.0%. For further information, refer to Note 9 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, other than operating leases described above and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities.\nSeasonality and Other Factors\nOur first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. In addition, quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following:\n \u2022 the volatility of lumber prices; \n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry; \n \u2022 general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete; \n \u2022 the pricing policies of our competitors; \n \u2022 the production schedules of our customers; and \n \u2022 the effects of weather. \nThe composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables, although this is generally offset in part by higher trade payables to our suppliers. Working capital levels typically increase in the second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction season. These increases have in the past resulted in negative operating cash flows during this peak season, which historically have been financed through available cash or excess availability on our Revolver. Collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season have in the past positively impacted cash flow. In the past, we have also utilized our borrowing availability under credit facilities to cover working capital needs.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our audited financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, actual results may be materially different from the estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue for sales of building products when products are delivered and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. All sales recognized are net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns, based on historical experience. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions are excluded from sales.\nThe percentage-of-completion method is used to recognize revenue for construction services. Periodic estimates of progress towards completion are made based on either a comparison of labor costs incurred to date with total estimated contract labor costs or total costs incurred to date with total estimated contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method requires the use of various estimates, including among others, the extent of progress towards completion, contract revenues and contract completion costs. Contract revenues and contract costs to be recognized are dependent on the accuracy of estimates, including quantities of materials, labor productivity and other cost estimates. The Company has a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards\ncompletion, contract revenues and contract completion costs. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual contract revenues and completion costs may vary from estimates.\nEstimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates reflect the Company's best estimate of probable losses of unbilled receivables, and are recognized in the period such revisions are known and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are recognized in cost of sales. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates are established by assessing estimated costs to complete, change orders and claims for uncompleted contracts. Assumptions for estimated costs to complete include material prices, labor costs, labor productivity and contract claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and therefore it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from these estimates.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), including subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model requiring companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate\u201d as it involves judgments about our customers' ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an assessment of individual past due accounts, historical write-off experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes and the business environment. Account balances are charged off when the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nManagement believes the allowance amounts recorded, in each instance, represent its best estimate of future outcomes. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of materials purchased for resale, including lumber and sheet goods, millwork, doors and windows as well as certain manufactured products, and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all of our inventories is determined by the weighted average cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out approach. We evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This evaluation includes an analysis of historical physical inventory results, a review of potential excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory aging and anticipated future demand. At least quarterly, each branch's perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect any declines in net realizable value below inventory carrying cost. To the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact, either favorably or unfavorably, the salability of our products or our relationships with certain key suppliers, our inventory reserves could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions.\nBusiness combinations\nFor all acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Management makes significant estimates and assumptions when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates include, but are not limited to, discount rates, projected future net sales, projected future expected cash flows and useful lives. When necessary, we will engage third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities.\nValuation of goodwill, long-lived assets and amortizable other intangible assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, purchased intangible assets and goodwill. The valuation and the impairment testing of these long-lived assets involve significant judgments and assumptions, particularly as they relate to the identification of reporting units, asset groups and the determination of fair market value.\nWe test our tangible and intangible long-lived assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur indicating that there may be impairment.\nWe have recorded goodwill and perform testing for potential goodwill impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is available, and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Additionally, components within an operating segment are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Beginning January 1, 2017, following the realignment of certain markets which resulted in the consolidation of the Company's historical Mountain West division into the Intermountain division, the Company's five operating segments, which have been determined to be the Company's reporting units, are the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Texas, Intermountain and Western divisions. Following the realignment, the chief operating decision maker continues to review aggregate information to allocate resources and assess performance. Based on this, as well as the similar economic characteristics, nature of products, distribution methods and customers of the divisions both before and after the realignment, the Company has aggregated its operating segments into one reportable segment. We complete our annual impairment assessment during the third quarter of each year. We did not recognize any impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nFor impairment testing of long-lived assets, we identify asset groups at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAs discussed above, changes in management intentions, market events or conditions, projected future net sales, operating results, cash flow of our reporting units and other similar circumstances could affect the assumptions used in the impairment tests. Although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and other long-lived assets are reasonable, differences between actual and expected net sales, operating results and cash flow could cause these assets to be impaired. If any asset were determined to be impaired, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, but not our cash flow from operations.\nStock based compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted restricted stock unit awards and performance restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and directors.\nWe account for restricted stock unit awards by recording compensation expense over the requisite service period, using graded vesting, based on the award's fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards is based on the price of our publicly traded common stock at the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards with performance conditions, we record compensation expense based on the expected number of units that will vest, which is adjusted, as appropriate, throughout the performance period.\nWe account for stock options granted to employees by recording compensation expense based on the award's fair value, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses inputs including the fair value per share of our common stock, volatility, expected term of the awards, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, based on management's judgment and subjective future expectations. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation recorded for future awards may differ materially from that recorded for awards granted previously.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nCasualty and health insurance\nWe carry insurance for general liability, auto liability and workers' compensation exposures subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we self-insure for employee and eligible dependent health care claims, with insurance purchased from independent carriers to cover individual claims in excess of the self-insured limits. The expected liability for unpaid claims, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined using the assistance of third-party actuaries and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability with current and long-term components. We have elected not to discount this liability. The amount recoverable from insurance providers is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Our accounting policy includes an internal evaluation and adjustment of our reserve for all insured losses on a quarterly basis. At least on an annual basis, we engage external actuarial professionals to independently assess and estimate the total liability outstanding, which is compared to the actual reserve balance at that time and adjusted accordingly.\nIncome taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The primary negative evidence considered includes the cumulative operating losses generated in prior periods. The primary positive evidence considered includes recent prior periods with cumulative operating income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization that would occur within the same jurisdiction and during the carry-forward period necessary to absorb the state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2017, the Company evaluated the positive and negative evidence in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2017, we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, net of a state tax valuation allowance of $0.1 million.\nASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and certain measurement principles for the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on an income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties associated with income taxes, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition requirements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognizes no material uncertain tax positions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the 2017 Tax Act. This legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from a maximum 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. The Company has recognized the net tax benefit of $3.6 million related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included this amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, on a provisional basis based on information currently available. The 2017 Tax Act may be subject to technical amendments, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, any of which could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation. As such, we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period ending no later than December 2018.\nConsideration received from suppliers\nWe enter into arrangements with many of our suppliers providing for inventory purchase rebates ( supplier rebates\u201d) upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels. We accrue estimated supplier rebates monthly as part of cost of goods sold based on progress toward earning the supplier rebates, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through the end of the year. We estimate the rebates applicable to inventory on-hand at each period end based on the inventory turns of the related items.\nUnder certain circumstances, including if market conditions were to change, suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs. Although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to product already purchased, it may impact our gross margins in future periods.", "item_7_tables": "Table 97:
