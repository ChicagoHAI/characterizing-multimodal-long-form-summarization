RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheels, folding camping trailers and truck campers). Approximately 73 percent of the Company's RV Segment net sales in 2015 were of products to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs accounted for 84 percent of all RVs shipped by the industry in 2015.\nThe Company's MH Segment manufactures or distributes a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes, including:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cfVinyl and aluminum windows\n</td> <td>\u25cfAluminum and vinyl patio doors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cfThermoformed bath and kitchen products\n</td> <td>\u25cfSteel chassis and related components\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cfSteel and fiberglass entry doors\n</td> <td>\u25cfAxles\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company also supplies certain of these products to the manufactured housing aftermarket and to adjacent industries, including modular housing and mobile office units. Certain of the Company's MH Segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes, and certain of the products manufactured by the Company are suitable for both types of homes. As a result, the Company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed.\nThe RV and manufactured housing industries, as well as other industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company's sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years.\nOver the past several years, largely due to the growth the Company has experienced in its RV Segment, the MH Segment\nis now a smaller part of the Company. MH Segment net sales were 8 percent of consolidated 2015 net sales. In addition, the Company has recently increased its focus on the significant opportunities in the aftermarket. The Company continues to evaluate the information provided to its Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), and assess how changes to its reporting structures would be used by the CODM to assess the performance of the Company's operating segments and make decisions about resource allocations. Any such changes could necessitate a revision to the operating segments the Company reports.\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND\nRecreational Vehicle Industry\nAn RV is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers).\nThe annual sales cycle for the RV industry has historically started in October after the Open House\u201d in Elkhart, Indiana where many of the largest RV OEMs display product to RV retail dealers, and ends after the conclusion of the summer selling season in September in the following calendar year. Between October and March, industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded retail sales as dealers build inventories to support anticipated sales. Between April and September, the spring and summer selling seasons, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded industry-wide wholesale shipments. Based on dealer surveys and information from wholesale finance companies, industry analysts report dealer inventories of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs are in-line with anticipated retail demand in the upcoming\nspring 2016 selling season. During 2015, wholesale sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RV exceeded retail sales by less than 1 percent, indicating dealers are managing their inventories more tightly and suggesting that changes in retail demand could more closely affect wholesale sales than in recent history.\nAccording to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ( RVIA\u201d), industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs in 2015, the Company's primary RV markets, increased 5 percent to 314,400 units compared to 2014, as a result of:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An estimated 35,900 unit increase in retail demand in 2015, or 13 percent, as compared to 2014. In addition, retail demand is typically revised upward in subsequent months, primarily due to delayed RV registrations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>RV dealers increasing inventory levels by 1,200 units in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> While the Company measures its RV sales against industry-wide wholesale shipment statistics, the underlying health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand. A comparison of the number of units and the year-over-year percentage change in industry-wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc., as well as the resulting estimated change in dealer inventories, for both the United States and Canada, is as follows:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Unit\nImpact on\nDealer\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Inventories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>298,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>268,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,200\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhome RVs in 2015 increased 8 percent to 47,300 units compared to 2014. Retail demand for motorhome RVs also increased 12 percent in 2015, following a 16 percent increase in retail demand in 2014.\nThe RVIA has projected a modest increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs for 2016. Several RV OEM customers are introducing new product lines, additional features and adding production capacity. Retail sales of RVs historically have been closely tied to general economic conditions, as well as consumer confidence which was above historical averages in 2015. Furthermore, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have increased in 72 of the last 74 months on a year-over-year basis. Industry resources report strong attendance and high consumer interest at RV shows around the United States and Canada in late 2015 and into early 2016.\nAlthough future retail demand is inherently uncertain, RV industry fundamentals in 2015, including generally low unemployment, low fuel prices and available credit for dealers and RV consumers, were strong, as evidenced by the 13 percent increase in industry-wide retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. The Company believes the strong RV industry fundamentals, aided by product innovation, demographic tailwinds, industry promotion and the advent of stronger dealer networks, are positive signs for 2016. The Company also remains confident in its ability to exceed industry growth rates through new product introductions, market share gains, aftermarket sales, acquisitions and ongoing investments in research and development, engineering, quality and customer service.\nOver the long term, the Company expects RV industry sales to be aided by positive demographics and the continued popularity of the RV Lifestyle\u201d. The number of consumers between the ages of 55 and 70 are projected to total 56 million by 2020, 27 percent higher than in 2010, according to U.S. Census figures, and one in ten vehicle-owning households between the ages of 50 and 64 own at least one RV. The RVIA reported much of the success of the RV industry has been driven by the Baby Boomer generation. The size of that generation is beginning to wane, and younger generations, Generation X and Millennials are becoming more relevant to future industry growth. Generation X and Millennials are more diverse, requiring new and creative marketing approaches to attract them to the RV industry. The RVIA has an advertising campaign promoting the RV Lifestyle\u201d targeted at both parents aged 30 - 49 with children at home, as well as couples aged 50 - 64 with no children at home. In addition, the RV OEMs have developed more entry level units, specifically targeting younger families, in both towables and motorhomes. The popularity of traveling in RVs to NASCAR and other sporting events, more family-oriented domestic vacations, and using RVs as second homes, are trends that could continue to motivate consumer demand for RVs. RVIA studies indicate RV vacations cost significantly less than other forms of vacation travel, even when factoring in fuel prices and the cost of RV ownership. More details can be found at www.RVIA.org.\nManufactured Housing Industry\nManufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis to which axles and wheels are attached. The homes are then transported to a manufactured housing dealer which sells and transports the home to the buyer's home site. The manufactured home is installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d). The federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction, methods to site and secure the home at a home site, strength and durability, transportability, fire resistance, energy efficiency and quality. The HUD code also sets performance standards for the heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. It is the only federally regulated national building code.\nManufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. A typical section may range in size from 800 to 1,200 square feet. During 2015, multi-section homes were 54 percent of the total manufactured homes produced, consistent with 2012 - 2014. Multi-section homes averaged 64 percent of the total manufactured homes produced between 2007 - 2010. Multi-section manufactured homes generally contain more of the Company's products than single-section manufactured homes.\nThe Institute for Building Technology and Safety ( IBTS\u201d) reported industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were 70,500 units in 2015, an increase of 10 percent from 2014. For the full year 2014, there were 64,300 industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2013.\nFor the 20 years prior to the sub-prime boom in home financing, manufactured housing industry-wide wholesale shipments represented 20 percent or more of single-family housing starts. During the sub-prime years of 2003 - 2007, when low cost loans were available for financing purchases of site-built homes, many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase site-built homes instead of manufactured homes, and manufactured housing's share of the single-family market dropped to below 10 percent. Since the sub-prime bubble\u201d burst in 2007 and 2008, this market share has averaged about 11 percent, despite interest rates for manufactured home loans remaining historically high relative to interest rates for site-built home loans. Accordingly, the Company believes the manufactured housing industry may experience a modest recovery if the economy continues to improve and home buyers look at affordable housing options. However, because of the current real estate, credit and economic environment, including the availability of site built homes at stable prices and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site-built homes and loans for manufactured homes, the Company expects industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes to remain low until these conditions improve.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulate financial transactions, have made certain types of mortgages, including chattel loans, more difficult or more expensive to obtain - in particular those historically used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been reviewing this matter and legislation has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives to address this matter, there can be no assurance of the outcome.\nNevertheless, the Company believes long-term growth prospects for manufactured housing remain positive because of the quality and affordability of the home, and favorable demographic trends, including the increasing number of retirees who, in the past, had represented a significant market for manufactured homes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Highlights\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to a record $1.4 billion, 18 percent higher than the year ended December 31, 2014.

This change improves accuracy, but has no impact on total RV Segment net sales or trends of content per unit. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nThe Company's average product content per type of RV excludes sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries. Content per RV is impacted by market share gains, acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of RVs produced industry-wide.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2015 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $20 million in net sales during 2015. With an estimated 10 million households in North America owning an RV and the Company's increasing content per unit, the Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in the RV aftermarket.\nThe Company's net sales to adjacent industries, including components for buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, and pontoon boats, increased during 2015 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2015, which acquisitions added $37 million in net sales during 2015. The Company continues to believe there are significant sales growth opportunities in adjacent industries.\nOver the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international RV sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2015. The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company has spent more than two years developing three slide-out systems suited to the needs of the European market, which were recently featured on new RV models. As a result, the Company believes it will see additional orders from European RV OEMs. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be $750 million.\nExcluding the severance charges in 2015 and the loss on sale of extrusion assets in 2014, operating profit of the RV Segment was $107.5 million in 2015, an improvement of $20.9 million, reflecting a 10 percent incremental margin compared to 2014. This increase in RV Segment operating profit was less than the Company's expected 15 to 20 percent incremental margin.

In addition to investments in fixed costs to expand manufacturing capacity, the Company made improvements in marketing, human resources, engineering, customer service and other critical departments. The Company also added the teams from acquired businesses as well as related amortization of intangible assets. As industry-wide wholesale shipments growth has slowed from multi-year double-digit rates to mid-single-digit rates, the Company evaluated its expenses and in the fourth quarter of 2015 initiated a focused program to reduce indirect labor costs to improve operating leverage.

Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nNet sales to the manufactured housing aftermarket increased due to market share gains.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per manufactured home produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new manufactured homes. Manufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. The larger homes typically contain more of the Company's products. The Company's average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to manufactured housing OEMs for newly produced manufactured homes for the years ended December 31, divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry, respectively, for the same period, was:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content per:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floor produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket and sales to adjacent industries.

The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 on the sale of the aluminum extrusion-related assets. In connection with the sale, the Company received $0.3 million at closing and a $7.2 million note receivable collectible over the next four years, recorded at its present value of $6.4 million on the date of closing. During 2015 and 2014, the Company received installments of $3.8 million under the note. At December 31, 2015, the present value of the remaining amount due under the note receivable was $3.2 million.\nIn July 2015, the Company agreed to terminate the supply agreement, and as consideration the Company received a $2.0 million note receivable collectible in 2019 and 2020. The Company recorded this note receivable at its present value of $1.6 million and a corresponding gain of $1.6 million in the 2015 third quarter. At December 31, 2015, the present value of the remaining amount due under the note receivable was $1.6 million.\nSeverance and Executive Succession\nIn 2015, the Company initiated a focused program to reduce indirect labor costs. In connection with this cost reduction program, the Company incurred severance charges of $3.7 million.\nIn 2013, in connection with the Company's executive succession and corporate relocation from White Plains, New York to Elkhart County, Indiana, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $1.9 million, related to contractual obligations for severance and the acceleration of equity awards held by certain employees whose employment terminated as a result of the executive succession and relocation to Indiana. The liability for executive succession and severance obligations were paid through 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for 2015 was 35.0 percent, more than the 34.5 percent in 2014. Both 2015 and 2014 benefited from federal and state tax credits, as well as the reversal of federal and state tax reserves, due to the closure of the statutes of limitation of federal and state tax years, with a larger benefit in 2014. The Company estimates the 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 35 percent to 36 percent.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2014 was 34.5 percent compared to 35.7 percent in 2013.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect the following for the years ended December 31:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operations\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2015 were $12.0 million lower than in 2014, primarily due to:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A larger increase in inventories of $9.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014.

A portion of the increase in inventory is also due to strategic positions to take advantage of favorable market conditions and include the strategic onboarding of a new supplier. Inventory turnover for 2015 decreased to 6.9 turns compared to 8.2 turns for 2014.

The purchase price was $9.2 million, of which $6.6 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the balance paid at closing.\nIn April 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Spectal, a Canada-based manufacturer of windows and doors primarily for school buses, as well as commercial buses, emergency vehicles, trucks, agricultural equipment and RVs. The purchase price was $22.3 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nIn August 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Roehm Marine, LLC, also known as Signature Seating, a manufacturer of furniture solutions for fresh water boat manufacturers, primarily pontoon boats. The purchase price was $16.0 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nThe Company's capital expenditures are primarily for replacement and growth. Over the long term, based on the Company's historical capital expenditures, the replacement portion has averaged approximately 2 percent of net sales, while the growth portion has averaged approximately 10 to 12 percent of the annual increase in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact the actual spending compared to these historical averages. In 2015 capital expenditures of $29 million were in line with historical averages. However, in 2014, the Company's capital expenditures were $42.5 million, higher than the aforementioned historical averages. The increased spending was the result of several long-term growth and capacity expansion initiatives. As such, coupled with the success achieved in lean manufacturing to free up additional manufacturing space, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet the increased manufacturing demands expected for 2016 and into 2017 with capital expenditures at or below the historical levels.\nThe Company estimates capital expenditures will be $20 million to $26 million in 2016, including $11 million to $14 million of replacement\u201d capital expenditures and $9 million to $12 million of growth\u201d capital expenditures. Additional capital expenditures may be required in 2016 depending on the extent of the sales growth, the effect of any acquisitions and other initiatives by the Company.\nThe 2015 capital expenditures and acquisitions were funded by cash from operations and periodic borrowings under the Company's line of credit and $50 million of Senior Promissory Notes issued under the shelf-loan\u201d facility with Prudential. The\n2016 capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily from cash generated from operations, as well as periodic borrowings under the Company's line of credit.\nCash flows used for investing activities of $144.1 million in 2014 were primarily comprised of $42.5 million for capital expenditures and $106.8 million for the acquisition of businesses.\nIn February 2014, the Company acquired IDS, a designer, developer and manufacturer of electronic systems encompassing a wide variety of RV applications. IDS also manufactures electronic systems for automotive, medical and industrial applications. The purchase price was $35.9 million, of which $34.2 million was paid at closing, with the balance to be paid out annually over the subsequent three years, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nIn March 2014, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Star Design, which manufactures thermoformed sheet plastic products for the RV, bus and specialty vehicle industries. The purchase price was $12.2 million paid at closing.\nIn June 2014, the Company acquired the RV business of Actuant Corporation, which manufactures leveling systems, slide-out mechanisms and steps, primarily for motorhome RVs, under the Power Gear and Kwikee brands. The purchase price was $35.5 million, paid at closing.\nIn August 2014, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Duncan Systems, an aftermarket distributor of replacement motorhome windshields, awnings, and RV, heavy truck and specialty vehicle glass and windows, primarily to fulfill insurance claims. The purchase price was $18.0 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash flows used by financing activities in 2015 included the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $48.2 million, paid to stockholders of record as of March 27, 2015, partially offset by a net increase in indebtedness of $34.4 million. The increase in indebtedness includes new debt comprised of $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes drawn in March 2015 under the Prudential Investment Management, Inc. shelf-loan\u201d facility, partially offset by a $15.7 million decrease in debt due to paying down the Company's line of credit. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of December 31, 2015, but borrowings reached a high of $71.6 million during 2015. In addition, the Company made $4.0 million in payments for contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\nCash flows used for financing activities in 2014 included the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $46.7 million, paid to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2013, partially offset by a net increase in indebtedness of $15.6 million. The increase in indebtedness was due to borrowings under the Company's line of credit. In addition, in 2014, the Company received $5.8 million in cash and the related tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation, offset by $3.7 million in payments for contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\nIn connection with certain business acquisitions, if established sales targets for the acquired products are achieved, the Company is contractually obligated to pay additional cash consideration. The Company has recorded a $10.8 million liability for the aggregate fair value of these expected contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2015, including $3.9 million recorded as a current liability. For further information, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 24, 2014, the Company entered into a $75.0 million line of credit (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., amending an existing facility first entered into in 2008. On March 3, 2015, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its line of credit by $25.0 million to $100.0 million. The Credit Agreement expires on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $2.7 million in standby letters of credit under the line of credit primarily to secure certain insurance arrangements. Availability under the Company's line of credit was $97.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nOn February 24, 2014, the Company also entered into a $150.0 million shelf-loan\u201d facility with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and its affiliates ( Prudential\u201d). The facility provides for Prudential to consider purchasing, at the Company's request, in one or a series of transactions, Senior Promissory Notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million, to mature no more than twelve years after the date of original issue of each Senior Promissory Note. Prudential has no obligation to purchase the Senior Promissory Notes. This facility expires on February 24, 2017. On March 20, 2015, the Company issued $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes to Prudential, under the shelf-loan\u201d facility, for a term of five years, at a fixed interest rate of 3.35 percent per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, of which the entire amount was outstanding at December 31, 2015. Availability under the Company's shelf-loan\u201d facility, subject to the approval of Prudential, was $100.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility, at December 31, 2015, the Company was required to maintain minimum interest and fixed charge coverages, and to meet certain other financial requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all such requirements.\nAvailability under both the Credit Agreement and the shelf-loan\u201d facilities is subject to a maximum leverage ratio covenant which limits the amount of consolidated outstanding indebtedness to 2.5 times the trailing twelve-month EBITDA, as defined in the agreements. This limitation did not impact the Company's borrowing availability at December 31, 2015. The remaining availability under these facilities was $197.3 million at December 31, 2015. The Company believes the availability under the Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility in conjunction with cash from operations is adequate to finance the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.\nAdditional information on the Company's Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility is included in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture minimum commitments relating to the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on fixed rate\nindebtedness (a)\n</td> <td>7,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>39,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts (b)\n</td> <td>15,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation (c)\n</td> <td>11,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty agreements and contingent consideration payments (d)\n</td> <td>14,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (e)\n</td> <td>587,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes (f)\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>728,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The Company has used the contractual payment dates and the fixed interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015, to determine the estimated future interest payments for fixed rate indebtedness.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Includes amounts payable under employment contracts and arrangements, and retirement and severance agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Includes amounts payable under deferred compensation arrangements.

The Company's governance documents and committee charters and key practices have been posted to the Company's website (www.drewindustries.com) and are updated periodically. The website also contains, or provides direct links to, all SEC filings, press releases and investor presentations. The Company has also established a Whistleblower Policy, which includes a toll-free hotline (877-373-9123) to report complaints about the Company's accounting, internal controls, auditing matters or other concerns. The Whistleblower Policy and procedure for complaints can be found on the Company's website (www.drewindustries.com).\nCONTINGENCIES\nAdditional information required by this item is included under Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. The following critical accounting policies, some of which are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates, affect the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies.\nInventories\nInventories (finished goods, work in process and raw materials) are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory (i.e. material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs). The Company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write-offs, taking into account future demand and market conditions. To the extent actual demand or market conditions in the future differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded inventory reserves may be required.\nSelf-Insurance\nThe Company is self-insured for certain health and workers' compensation benefits up to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred, but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by third-party claims administrators. This estimation process is subjective, and to the extent actual results differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded accruals may be required.\nWarranty\nThe Company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product sold. The Company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors, including (i) historical warranty costs, (ii) current trends, (iii) product mix, and (iv) sales. The accounting for warranty accruals requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments, and to the extent actual results differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded accruals may be required.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's tax provision is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, federal and state tax credits, and tax planning strategies. Significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the Company's tax position. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief the tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits. The Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences, which are expected to reduce future taxable income. These assets are based on management's estimate of realizability, which is reassessed each quarter based upon the Company's forecast of future taxable income. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets, and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Net Assets of Acquired Businesses\nThe Company values the assets and liabilities associated with the acquisitions of businesses on the respective acquisition dates. Depending upon the type of asset or liability acquired, the Company uses different valuation techniques in determining the fair value. Those techniques include comparable market prices, long-term sales, profitability and cash flow forecasts, assumptions regarding future industry-specific economic and market conditions, a market participant's weighted average cost of capital, as well as other techniques as circumstances required. By their nature, these assumptions require judgment, and if management had\nchosen different assumptions, the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses would have been different. For further information on acquired assets and liabilities, see Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, including Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe Company performs recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset. In the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value would be recorded.\nFor other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for other assets consists of an assessment of qualitative factors. If such qualitative factors do not support that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, the Company then uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe Company's assessment of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates management uses when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those management uses in its internal planning. When performing impairment tests, management estimates the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which is believed to be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, the Company does not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result.\nContingent Consideration Payments\nIn connection with several acquisitions, in addition to the cash paid at closing, additional payments could be required depending upon the level of sales generated from certain of the acquired products. The fair value of the aggregate estimated contingent consideration payments has been recorded as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each quarter, the Company is required to re-evaluate the fair value of the liability for the estimated contingent consideration payments for such acquisitions. The fair value of the contingent consideration payments is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. This model involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including sales of certain products, future business plans, economic projections, weighted average cost of capital, and market data. Actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nOther Estimates\nThe Company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, those related to product returns, sales and purchase rebates, accounts receivable, lease terminations, asset retirement obligations, long-lived assets, executive succession, post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, segment allocations, environmental liabilities, contingencies and litigation. Establishing reserves for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization. As a result, these estimates are based on management's current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors, as appropriate. Due to uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation required by this item is included in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nThe prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of steel and aluminum, and components used by the Company which are made from these raw materials, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities, rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures. Prices of these commodities have historically been volatile, and over the past few months prices have continued to fluctuate. The Company did not experience any significant increases in its labor costs in 2015 related to inflation.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Report.\nDrew Industries Incorporated ( Drew\u201d, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company\u201d), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Lippert Components\u201d or LCI\u201d), supplies a broad array of components in the United States and abroad for the leading manufacturers of recreational vehicles ( RVs\u201d) and manufactured homes and for the related aftermarkets of those industries. The Company also supplies components for adjacent industries including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; modular housing; and factory-built mobile office units.\nThe Company has two reportable segments: the recreational vehicle products segment (the RV Segment\u201d) and the manufactured housing products segment (the MH Segment\u201d).

RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheels, folding camping trailers and truck campers). Approximately 73 percent of the Company's RV Segment net sales in 2015 were of products to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs accounted for 84 percent of all RVs shipped by the industry in 2015.\nThe Company's MH Segment manufactures or distributes a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes, including:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cfVinyl and aluminum windows\n</td> <td>\u25cfAluminum and vinyl patio doors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cfThermoformed bath and kitchen products\n</td> <td>\u25cfSteel chassis and related components\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cfSteel and fiberglass entry doors\n</td> <td>\u25cfAxles\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company also supplies certain of these products to the manufactured housing aftermarket and to adjacent industries, including modular housing and mobile office units. Certain of the Company's MH Segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes, and certain of the products manufactured by the Company are suitable for both types of homes. As a result, the Company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed.\nThe RV and manufactured housing industries, as well as other industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company's sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years.\nOver the past several years, largely due to the growth the Company has experienced in its RV Segment, the MH Segment\nis now a smaller part of the Company. MH Segment net sales were 8 percent of consolidated 2015 net sales. In addition, the Company has recently increased its focus on the significant opportunities in the aftermarket. The Company continues to evaluate the information provided to its Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), and assess how changes to its reporting structures would be used by the CODM to assess the performance of the Company's operating segments and make decisions about resource allocations. Any such changes could necessitate a revision to the operating segments the Company reports.\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND\nRecreational Vehicle Industry\nAn RV is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers).\nThe annual sales cycle for the RV industry has historically started in October after the Open House\u201d in Elkhart, Indiana where many of the largest RV OEMs display product to RV retail dealers, and ends after the conclusion of the summer selling season in September in the following calendar year. Between October and March, industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded retail sales as dealers build inventories to support anticipated sales. Between April and September, the spring and summer selling seasons, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded industry-wide wholesale shipments. Based on dealer surveys and information from wholesale finance companies, industry analysts report dealer inventories of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs are in-line with anticipated retail demand in the upcoming\nspring 2016 selling season. During 2015, wholesale sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RV exceeded retail sales by less than 1 percent, indicating dealers are managing their inventories more tightly and suggesting that changes in retail demand could more closely affect wholesale sales than in recent history.\nAccording to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ( RVIA\u201d), industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs in 2015, the Company's primary RV markets, increased 5 percent to 314,400 units compared to 2014, as a result of:\n \u2022 An estimated 35,900 unit increase in retail demand in 2015, or 13 percent, as compared to 2014. In addition, retail demand is typically revised upward in subsequent months, primarily due to delayed RV registrations. \n \u2022 RV dealers increasing inventory levels by 1,200 units in 2015.  While the Company measures its RV sales against industry-wide wholesale shipment statistics, the underlying health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand. A comparison of the number of units and the year-over-year percentage change in industry-wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc., as well as the resulting estimated change in dealer inventories, for both the United States and Canada, is as follows:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Unit\nImpact on\nDealer\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Inventories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>298,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>268,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,200\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhome RVs in 2015 increased 8 percent to 47,300 units compared to 2014. Retail demand for motorhome RVs also increased 12 percent in 2015, following a 16 percent increase in retail demand in 2014.\nThe RVIA has projected a modest increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs for 2016. Several RV OEM customers are introducing new product lines, additional features and adding production capacity. Retail sales of RVs historically have been closely tied to general economic conditions, as well as consumer confidence which was above historical averages in 2015. Furthermore, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have increased in 72 of the last 74 months on a year-over-year basis. Industry resources report strong attendance and high consumer interest at RV shows around the United States and Canada in late 2015 and into early 2016.\nAlthough future retail demand is inherently uncertain, RV industry fundamentals in 2015, including generally low unemployment, low fuel prices and available credit for dealers and RV consumers, were strong, as evidenced by the 13 percent increase in industry-wide retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. The Company believes the strong RV industry fundamentals, aided by product innovation, demographic tailwinds, industry promotion and the advent of stronger dealer networks, are positive signs for 2016. The Company also remains confident in its ability to exceed industry growth rates through new product introductions, market share gains, aftermarket sales, acquisitions and ongoing investments in research and development, engineering, quality and customer service.\nOver the long term, the Company expects RV industry sales to be aided by positive demographics and the continued popularity of the RV Lifestyle\u201d. The number of consumers between the ages of 55 and 70 are projected to total 56 million by 2020, 27 percent higher than in 2010, according to U.S. Census figures, and one in ten vehicle-owning households between the ages of 50 and 64 own at least one RV. The RVIA reported much of the success of the RV industry has been driven by the Baby Boomer generation. The size of that generation is beginning to wane, and younger generations, Generation X and Millennials are becoming more relevant to future industry growth. Generation X and Millennials are more diverse, requiring new and creative marketing approaches to attract them to the RV industry. The RVIA has an advertising campaign promoting the RV Lifestyle\u201d targeted at both parents aged 30 - 49 with children at home, as well as couples aged 50 - 64 with no children at home. In addition, the RV OEMs have developed more entry level units, specifically targeting younger families, in both towables and motorhomes. The popularity of traveling in RVs to NASCAR and other sporting events, more family-oriented domestic vacations, and using RVs as second homes, are trends that could continue to motivate consumer demand for RVs. RVIA studies indicate RV vacations cost significantly less than other forms of vacation travel, even when factoring in fuel prices and the cost of RV ownership. More details can be found at www.RVIA.org.\nManufactured Housing Industry\nManufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis to which axles and wheels are attached. The homes are then transported to a manufactured housing dealer which sells and transports the home to the buyer's home site. The manufactured home is installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d). The federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction, methods to site and secure the home at a home site, strength and durability, transportability, fire resistance, energy efficiency and quality. The HUD code also sets performance standards for the heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. It is the only federally regulated national building code.\nManufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. A typical section may range in size from 800 to 1,200 square feet. During 2015, multi-section homes were 54 percent of the total manufactured homes produced, consistent with 2012 - 2014. Multi-section homes averaged 64 percent of the total manufactured homes produced between 2007 - 2010. Multi-section manufactured homes generally contain more of the Company's products than single-section manufactured homes.\nThe Institute for Building Technology and Safety ( IBTS\u201d) reported industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were 70,500 units in 2015, an increase of 10 percent from 2014. For the full year 2014, there were 64,300 industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2013.\nFor the 20 years prior to the sub-prime boom in home financing, manufactured housing industry-wide wholesale shipments represented 20 percent or more of single-family housing starts. During the sub-prime years of 2003 - 2007, when low cost loans were available for financing purchases of site-built homes, many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase site-built homes instead of manufactured homes, and manufactured housing's share of the single-family market dropped to below 10 percent. Since the sub-prime bubble\u201d burst in 2007 and 2008, this market share has averaged about 11 percent, despite interest rates for manufactured home loans remaining historically high relative to interest rates for site-built home loans. Accordingly, the Company believes the manufactured housing industry may experience a modest recovery if the economy continues to improve and home buyers look at affordable housing options. However, because of the current real estate, credit and economic environment, including the availability of site built homes at stable prices and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site-built homes and loans for manufactured homes, the Company expects industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes to remain low until these conditions improve.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulate financial transactions, have made certain types of mortgages, including chattel loans, more difficult or more expensive to obtain - in particular those historically used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been reviewing this matter and legislation has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives to address this matter, there can be no assurance of the outcome.\nNevertheless, the Company believes long-term growth prospects for manufactured housing remain positive because of the quality and affordability of the home, and favorable demographic trends, including the increasing number of retirees who, in the past, had represented a significant market for manufactured homes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Highlights\n \u2022 Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to a record $1.4 billion, 18 percent higher than the year ended December 31, 2014. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2015, as well as the Furrion Limited ( Furrion\u201d) distribution and supply agreement for premium electronics (the Furrion Agreement\u201d), added $52 million in net sales in 2015. The five percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company's primary RV market, as well as increased content per unit through market share gains, positively impacted net sales growth in 2015. \n \u2022 In 2015, the Company continued to grow sales to both adjacent industries and the aftermarket for the RV and manufactured housing segments. Aggregate net sales to adjacent industries increased 40 percent to $193 million and aftermarket net sales increased 62 percent to $103 million. Together, these markets now account for 21 percent of consolidated net sales, double the percentage from 2010. \n \u2022 For the full-year 2015, the Company's net income increased to $74.3 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, up from net income of $62.3 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, in 2014. Excluding certain charges for severance, environmental and legal costs in 2015, net income would have been $79.0 million in 2015, or $3.20 per diluted share, and excluding the 2014 loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum extrusion-related assets, net income would have been $63.5 million in 2014, or $2.61 per diluted share. \n \u2022 Consolidated operating profits during 2015 increased 22 percent, to $116.3 million in 2015 from $95.5 million in 2014. Operating profit margin increased to 8.3 percent in 2015 from 8.0 percent in 2014. \n \u2022 Raw material costs continue to fluctuate. In particular, aluminum rose nearly 20 percent during the second half of 2014, and dropped during the second half of 2015. Similarly, the cost of steel used in certain of the Company's manufactured components dropped during the course of 2015; however, certain market prices have increased in early 2016 from the low points experienced during 2015. Raw material costs are expected to remain volatile. \n \u2022 During 2015 the Company completed three acquisitions: \n \u2022 Signature Seating -- A Ft. Wayne, Indiana-based manufacturer of furniture solutions for fresh water boat manufacturers, primarily pontoon boats, with annual sales of approximately $16 million; \n \u2022 Spectal Industries -- A Canada-based manufacturer of windows and doors primarily for school buses, as well as commercial buses, emergency vehicles, trucks, agricultural equipment and RVs, with annual sales of $25 million. \n \u2022 EA Technologies -- An Elkhart, Indiana-based manufacturer of custom steel and aluminum parts and provider of electro-deposition (\u2018e-coat') and powder coating services for RV, bus, medium-duty truck, automotive, recreational marine, specialty and utility trailer, and military applications, with annual sales of $17 million.  The Company plans to grow sales and leverage its purchasing power and manufacturing capabilities in addition to its engineering and design resources to improve the cost structure of the acquired operations. After funding these acquisitions in 2015, the Company believes it has access to sufficient financial capital and staff to take advantage of additional investment opportunities.\n \u2022 For 2015, the Company achieved an 18.4 percent return on equity, an improvement from the 17.5 percent return on equity in 2014. \n \u2022 In April 2015, the Company paid a special dividend of $2.00 per share, aggregating $48.2 million. \nRV Segment\nNet sales of the RV Segment in 2015 increased 20 percent, or $210 million, compared to 2014. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RV OEMs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel trailers and fifth-wheels\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>841,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorhomes\n</td> <td>86,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RV aftermarket\n</td> <td>87,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjacent industries\n</td> <td>172,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total RV Segment net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,284,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorhomes\n</td> <td>47,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during 2015 exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during the same period primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2015, which acquisitions added $6 million in net sales during 2015.\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for motorhomes during 2015 exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes during the same period primarily due to market share gains and an acquisition completed in 2014, which acquisition added $8 million in net sales during 2015. Over the past few years, the Company has been expanding its product line of components for motorhomes in order to increase its customer base and market penetration, and further growth is expected.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per RV produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new RVs. The Company's average product content per type of RV, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to RV OEMs for the different types of RVs produced for the years ended December 31, divided by the industry-wide wholesale shipments of the different types of RVs for the same period, was:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content per:\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorhome\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company refined the calculation of RV content per unit. This change improves accuracy, but has no impact on total RV Segment net sales or trends of content per unit. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nThe Company's average product content per type of RV excludes sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries. Content per RV is impacted by market share gains, acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of RVs produced industry-wide.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2015 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $20 million in net sales during 2015. With an estimated 10 million households in North America owning an RV and the Company's increasing content per unit, the Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in the RV aftermarket.\nThe Company's net sales to adjacent industries, including components for buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, and pontoon boats, increased during 2015 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2015, which acquisitions added $37 million in net sales during 2015. The Company continues to believe there are significant sales growth opportunities in adjacent industries.\nOver the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international RV sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2015. The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company has spent more than two years developing three slide-out systems suited to the needs of the European market, which were recently featured on new RV models. As a result, the Company believes it will see additional orders from European RV OEMs. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be $750 million.\nExcluding the severance charges in 2015 and the loss on sale of extrusion assets in 2014, operating profit of the RV Segment was $107.5 million in 2015, an improvement of $20.9 million, reflecting a 10 percent incremental margin compared to 2014. This increase in RV Segment operating profit was less than the Company's expected 15 to 20 percent incremental margin. The operating profit margin of the RV Segment in 2015 was adversely impacted by:\n \u2022 Fixed costs which were approximately $15 to $20 million higher than in 2014. Over the past couple of years, the Company made significant investments in manufacturing capacity, both facilities and personnel, to prepare for the expected increase in net sales in 2015 and beyond. In addition to investments in fixed costs to expand manufacturing capacity, the Company made improvements in marketing, human resources, engineering, customer service and other critical departments. The Company also added the teams from acquired businesses as well as related amortization of intangible assets. As industry-wide wholesale shipments growth has slowed from multi-year double-digit rates to mid-single-digit rates, the Company evaluated its expenses and in the fourth quarter of 2015 initiated a focused program to reduce indirect labor costs to improve operating leverage. Annual cost savings of approximately $8 to $10 million were identified and implemented late in 2015 and will come from aligning staff levels more closely to anticipated growth. \n \u2022 An increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $3.2 million due to the implementation of the new 2015 compensation program for management. \n \u2022 Sales mix changes of its products, including lower sales of fifth-wheel products. \n \u2022 A charge of $1.5 million related to environmental costs. \n \u2022 A voluntary safety recall of the Company's double and triple Coach Steps, for which the Company recorded a reserve of $1.1 million for the contingent obligation in selling, general and administrative expenses. \nPartially offset by:\n \u2022 Investments over the past several years to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies, which benefit operating results. The Company added capacity ahead of projected demand, which enabled it to efficiently fulfill customer orders as demand increased. Further, the Company has implemented additional efficiency improvements, including lean, automation and employee retention initiatives to improve operating efficiencies going forward. \n \u2022 Lower material costs for certain raw material inputs. After increasing in the latter part of 2014, steel and aluminum costs declined over the course of 2015. Nevertheless, material costs, which are subject to global supply and demand forces, remain volatile. \n \u2022 Better fixed costs absorption by spreading fixed costs over a $212 million larger sales base. \nMH Segment\nNet sales of the MH Segment in 2015 increased 2 percent, or $2 million, compared to 2014. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufactured housing OEMs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufactured housing aftermarket\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjacent industries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MH Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the IBTS, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total homes produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total floors produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes increased during 2015 when compared to 2014, as well as the Company's net sales of components for new manufactured homes increased during 2015, primarily due to customer mix, as the Company's content per unit varies between customers.\nManufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. The larger homes typically contain more of the Company's products. The Company's average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to manufactured housing OEMs for newly produced manufactured homes for the years ended December 31, divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry, respectively, for the same period, was:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content per:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floor produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket and sales to adjacent industries. Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nOperating profit of the MH Segment was $12.5 million in 2015, an increase of $1.6 million compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in net sales from higher unit sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nConsolidated Highlights\n \u2022 Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $1.2 billion, 17 percent higher than the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the 20 percent increase in net sales of the Company's RV Segment. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2014 added $36 million in net sales in 2014. The twelve percent increase \nin industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company's primary RV market, as well as increased content per unit through market share gains, positively impacted net sales growth in 2014.\n \u2022 In 2014, the Company continued to grow both adjacent industries and the aftermarket for the RV and manufactured housing segments. Aggregate net sales to adjacent industries increased 14 percent to $138 million and aftermarket net sales increased 63 percent to $64 million. \n \u2022 For the full-year 2014, the Company's net income increased to $62.3 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, up from net income of $50.1 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, in 2013. Excluding the loss related to the sale of the Company's aluminum extrusion-related assets in 2014 and charges for executive succession in 2013, net income would have been $63.5 million in 2014, or $2.61 per diluted share, up from net income of $51.3 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, in 2013. Net income in 2014 was also impacted by facility start-up and realignment costs, which reduced net income per diluted share by approximately $0.09. \n \u2022 Consolidated operating profits during 2014 increased 22 percent, to $95.5 million in 2014 from $78.3 million in 2013. Operating profit margin increased to 8.0 percent in 2014 from 7.7 percent in 2013. As a result of facility start-up and realignment costs, as well as higher health insurance costs, the Company's incremental margin in 2014 was lower than its historical average. \n \u25aa During 2014 the Company completed four acquisitions, which added approximately $68 million of acquired annual sales, of which $36 million occurred in 2014. The four operations acquired by the Company during 2014 were: \n \u25aa Innovative Design Solutions, Inc. ( IDS\u201d) - A designer, developer and manufacturer of electronic systems encompassing a wide variety of RV, automotive, medical and industrial applications, with annual sales of $19 million, of which $15 million were to the Company; \n \u25aa Star Design, LLC ( Star Design\u201d) - A manufacturer of thermoformed sheet plastic products for the RV, bus and specialty vehicle industries, with annual sales of $10 million; \n \u25aa Power Gear\u00ae and Kwikee\u00ae brands (RV business of Actuant Corporation) - A manufacturer of leveling systems, slide-out mechanisms and steps, primarily for motorhome RVs, with annual sales of $28 million; \n \u25aa Duncan Systems, Inc. ( Duncan Systems\u201d) - A supplier of replacement motorhome windshields, awnings, and RV, heavy truck, and specialty vehicle glass and windows, primarily to fulfill insurance claims, with annual sales of $26 million. \n \u2022 For 2014, the Company achieved a 17.5 percent return on equity, an improvement from the 16.0 percent return on equity in 2013. \n \u2022 In January 2014, the Company paid a special dividend of $2.00 per share, aggregating $47 million. \nRV Segment\nNet sales of the RV Segment in 2014 increased 20 percent, or $181 million, compared to 2013. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RV OEMs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel trailers and fifth-wheels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>841,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>727,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorhomes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RV aftermarket\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjacent industries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total RV Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>893,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorhomes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during 2014 exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $4 million in net sales during 2014.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2014 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $9 million in net sales during 2014. With an estimated 10 million households in North America owning an RV, the Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in the RV aftermarket.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per RV produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new RVs. The Company's average product content per type of RV, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to RV OEMs for the different types of RVs produced for the years ended December 31, divided by the industry-wide wholesale shipments of the different types of RVs for the same period, was:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content per:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorhome\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's average product content per type of RV excludes sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries. Content per RV is impacted by market share gains, acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of RVs produced industry-wide.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2014 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $15 million in net sales during 2014.\nThe Company's net sales to adjacent industries, including components for buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, truck campers and truck caps, increased during 2014 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $8 million in net sales during 2014.\nOperating profit of the RV Segment was $86.6 million in 2014, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to 2013. This increase in RV Segment operating profit was less than the Company's expected 15 to 20 percent incremental margin. The operating profit margin of the RV Segment in 2014 was adversely impacted by:\n \u2022 Higher health insurance costs, largely due to increased employee participation. \n \u2022 Fixed costs, which were approximately $15 million higher than in 2013. In response to the increase in net sales, the Company bolstered its administrative staff during 2014, including the teams that were acquired through acquisitions and new employees hired in preparation for future growth and investment opportunities.  In early 2014, the Company entered into two new leases which added more than 700,000 square feet of production and distribution capacity. These two new leased facilities became operational during the latter half of 2014 and the realignment of the related operations were completed.\nPartially offset by:\n \u2022 The elimination of production inefficiencies and costs incurred as a result of significant growth which occurred in 2012 and early 2013. \n \u2022 Lower payroll costs as a percent of sales, largely due to a reduction in state unemployment tax rates and improved employee retention. \n \u2022 Lower warranty costs as a percent of sales, largely due to lower claim experience. \n \u2022 The spreading of fixed costs over a $181 million larger sales base. \nMH Segment\nNet sales of the MH Segment in 2014 decreased 5 percent, or $6 million, compared to 2013. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufactured housing OEMs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufactured housing aftermarket\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjacent industries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MH Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the IBTS, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total homes produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total floors produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for new manufactured homes was less than the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes, primarily due to customer mix, as the Company's content per unit varies between customers, and loss of market share for certain products. Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nNet sales to the manufactured housing aftermarket increased due to market share gains.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per manufactured home produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new manufactured homes. Manufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. The larger homes typically contain more of the Company's products. The Company's average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to manufactured housing OEMs for newly produced manufactured homes for the years ended December 31, divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry, respectively, for the same period, was:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content per:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floor produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket and sales to adjacent industries. Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nOperating profit of the MH Segment was $10.9 million in 2014, a decrease of $1.1 million compared to 2013 primarily due to the decline in net sales.\nSale of Extrusion Assets\nIn April 2014, the Company entered into a six-year aluminum extrusion supply agreement, and concurrently sold certain aluminum extrusion assets. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 on the sale of the aluminum extrusion-related assets. In connection with the sale, the Company received $0.3 million at closing and a $7.2 million note receivable collectible over the next four years, recorded at its present value of $6.4 million on the date of closing. During 2015 and 2014, the Company received installments of $3.8 million under the note. At December 31, 2015, the present value of the remaining amount due under the note receivable was $3.2 million.\nIn July 2015, the Company agreed to terminate the supply agreement, and as consideration the Company received a $2.0 million note receivable collectible in 2019 and 2020. The Company recorded this note receivable at its present value of $1.6 million and a corresponding gain of $1.6 million in the 2015 third quarter. At December 31, 2015, the present value of the remaining amount due under the note receivable was $1.6 million.\nSeverance and Executive Succession\nIn 2015, the Company initiated a focused program to reduce indirect labor costs. In connection with this cost reduction program, the Company incurred severance charges of $3.7 million.\nIn 2013, in connection with the Company's executive succession and corporate relocation from White Plains, New York to Elkhart County, Indiana, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $1.9 million, related to contractual obligations for severance and the acceleration of equity awards held by certain employees whose employment terminated as a result of the executive succession and relocation to Indiana. The liability for executive succession and severance obligations were paid through 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for 2015 was 35.0 percent, more than the 34.5 percent in 2014. Both 2015 and 2014 benefited from federal and state tax credits, as well as the reversal of federal and state tax reserves, due to the closure of the statutes of limitation of federal and state tax years, with a larger benefit in 2014. The Company estimates the 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 35 percent to 36 percent.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2014 was 34.5 percent compared to 35.7 percent in 2013.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect the following for the years ended December 31:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operations\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2015 were $12.0 million lower than in 2014, primarily due to:\n \u2022 A larger increase in inventories of $9.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in inventories in 2015 was primarily due to increases in sourced products, including inventory to support the Furrion Agreement (discussed immediately below) and acquisitions completed in 2015. A portion of the increase in inventory is also due to strategic positions to take advantage of favorable market conditions and include the strategic onboarding of a new supplier. Inventory turnover for 2015 decreased to 6.9 turns compared to 8.2 turns for 2014. The Company is working to improve inventory turnover over the coming quarters, however, inventory turns may trend lower due to growth in product categories such as imported furniture and Furrion electronics. \n \u2022 In July 2015, the Company entered into a 6-year exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Furrion Limited ( Furrion\u201d), a Hong Kong based firm that designs, engineers and manufactures premium electronics. This agreement provides the Company with the rights to distribute Furrion's complete line of products to OEMs and aftermarket customers in the RV, specialty vehicle, utility trailer, horse trailer, marine, transit bus and school bus industries throughout the United States and Canada. Furrion currently supplies a premium line of LED televisions, sound systems, navigation systems, wireless backup cameras, solar prep units, power solutions and kitchen appliances, primarily to the RV industry. In connection with this agreement, the Company acquired Furrion's current inventory, as well as Furrion's deposits on inventory scheduled for delivery, for approximately $11 million. \n \u2022 A $5.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2015 compared to a $31.2 million increase in 2014, primarily due to increased imports and other prepaid inventories, efforts to increase consignments as well as the timing of purchases.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $12.1 million increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014. \n \u2022 Increases in non-cash charges against net income in 2015 including: \n \u2022 A $9.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to investments in acquisitions and capital expenditures. \n \u2022 A $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. \n \u2022 An increase in deferred taxes of $1.1 million in 2015 compared to a $5.5 million decrease in 2014 due to an increase in certain expenses currently not deductible for tax purposes in 2015.  Over the long term, based on the Company's historical collection and payment patterns, as well as inventory turnover, and also giving consideration to emerging trends and changes to the sales mix, the Company expects working capital to increase or decrease equivalent to approximately 11 to 14 percent of the increase or decrease, respectively, in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact this relationship, especially in the short term.\nDepreciation and amortization was $41.6 million in 2015, and is expected to be approximately $42 million to $47 million for fiscal year 2016. Non-cash stock-based compensation in 2015 was $16.1 million, including $2.0 million of deferred stock units issued to certain executive officers in lieu of cash for a portion of their 2014 incentive compensation in accordance with their compensation arrangements. Non-cash stock-based compensation is expected to be approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2014 were $24.3 million higher than in 2013, primarily due to:\n \u2022 A $12.1 million increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013. \n \u2022 A $24.0 million larger increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the increases in sales, production and earnings, as well as the timing of these payments. \n \u2022 An $8.5 million smaller increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in days sales outstanding to 15 at December 31, 2014, compared to 17 at December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 A $5.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2014 and capital expenditures over the last couple years.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 An $18.5 million larger increase in inventories in 2014 as compared to 2013. The larger increase in inventories in 2014 was primarily to support the 41 percent increase in net sales in January 2015. Higher raw material costs and increased lead time on imports also contributed to the increase in inventory. Inventory turnover for 2014 improved to 8.2 turns compared to 7.9 turns for 2013. \n \u2022 An increase in deferred taxes of $5.5 million in 2014 compared to a $0.3 million decrease in 2013 due to an increase in certain expenses not currently deductible for tax purposes in 2014.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities of $66.1 million in 2015 were primarily comprised of $41.1 million for the acquisition of businesses and $29.0 million for capital expenditures.\nIn January 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of EA Technologies, a manufacturer of custom steel and aluminum parts and provider of electro-deposition (\u2018e-coat') and powder coating services for RV, bus, medium-duty truck, automotive, recreational marine, specialty and utility trailer, and military applications. The purchase price was $9.2 million, of which $6.6 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the balance paid at closing.\nIn April 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Spectal, a Canada-based manufacturer of windows and doors primarily for school buses, as well as commercial buses, emergency vehicles, trucks, agricultural equipment and RVs. The purchase price was $22.3 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nIn August 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Roehm Marine, LLC, also known as Signature Seating, a manufacturer of furniture solutions for fresh water boat manufacturers, primarily pontoon boats. The purchase price was $16.0 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nThe Company's capital expenditures are primarily for replacement and growth. Over the long term, based on the Company's historical capital expenditures, the replacement portion has averaged approximately 2 percent of net sales, while the growth portion has averaged approximately 10 to 12 percent of the annual increase in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact the actual spending compared to these historical averages. In 2015 capital expenditures of $29 million were in line with historical averages. However, in 2014, the Company's capital expenditures were $42.5 million, higher than the aforementioned historical averages. The increased spending was the result of several long-term growth and capacity expansion initiatives. As such, coupled with the success achieved in lean manufacturing to free up additional manufacturing space, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet the increased manufacturing demands expected for 2016 and into 2017 with capital expenditures at or below the historical levels.\nThe Company estimates capital expenditures will be $20 million to $26 million in 2016, including $11 million to $14 million of replacement\u201d capital expenditures and $9 million to $12 million of growth\u201d capital expenditures. Additional capital expenditures may be required in 2016 depending on the extent of the sales growth, the effect of any acquisitions and other initiatives by the Company.\nThe 2015 capital expenditures and acquisitions were funded by cash from operations and periodic borrowings under the Company's line of credit and $50 million of Senior Promissory Notes issued under the shelf-loan\u201d facility with Prudential. The\n2016 capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily from cash generated from operations, as well as periodic borrowings under the Company's line of credit.\nCash flows used for investing activities of $144.1 million in 2014 were primarily comprised of $42.5 million for capital expenditures and $106.8 million for the acquisition of businesses.\nIn February 2014, the Company acquired IDS, a designer, developer and manufacturer of electronic systems encompassing a wide variety of RV applications. IDS also manufactures electronic systems for automotive, medical and industrial applications. The purchase price was $35.9 million, of which $34.2 million was paid at closing, with the balance to be paid out annually over the subsequent three years, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nIn March 2014, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Star Design, which manufactures thermoformed sheet plastic products for the RV, bus and specialty vehicle industries. The purchase price was $12.2 million paid at closing.\nIn June 2014, the Company acquired the RV business of Actuant Corporation, which manufactures leveling systems, slide-out mechanisms and steps, primarily for motorhome RVs, under the Power Gear and Kwikee brands. The purchase price was $35.5 million, paid at closing.\nIn August 2014, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Duncan Systems, an aftermarket distributor of replacement motorhome windshields, awnings, and RV, heavy truck and specialty vehicle glass and windows, primarily to fulfill insurance claims. The purchase price was $18.0 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash flows used by financing activities in 2015 included the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $48.2 million, paid to stockholders of record as of March 27, 2015, partially offset by a net increase in indebtedness of $34.4 million. The increase in indebtedness includes new debt comprised of $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes drawn in March 2015 under the Prudential Investment Management, Inc. shelf-loan\u201d facility, partially offset by a $15.7 million decrease in debt due to paying down the Company's line of credit. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of December 31, 2015, but borrowings reached a high of $71.6 million during 2015. In addition, the Company made $4.0 million in payments for contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\nCash flows used for financing activities in 2014 included the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $46.7 million, paid to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2013, partially offset by a net increase in indebtedness of $15.6 million. The increase in indebtedness was due to borrowings under the Company's line of credit. In addition, in 2014, the Company received $5.8 million in cash and the related tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation, offset by $3.7 million in payments for contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\nIn connection with certain business acquisitions, if established sales targets for the acquired products are achieved, the Company is contractually obligated to pay additional cash consideration. The Company has recorded a $10.8 million liability for the aggregate fair value of these expected contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2015, including $3.9 million recorded as a current liability. For further information, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 24, 2014, the Company entered into a $75.0 million line of credit (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., amending an existing facility first entered into in 2008. On March 3, 2015, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its line of credit by $25.0 million to $100.0 million. The Credit Agreement expires on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $2.7 million in standby letters of credit under the line of credit primarily to secure certain insurance arrangements. Availability under the Company's line of credit was $97.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nOn February 24, 2014, the Company also entered into a $150.0 million shelf-loan\u201d facility with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and its affiliates ( Prudential\u201d). The facility provides for Prudential to consider purchasing, at the Company's request, in one or a series of transactions, Senior Promissory Notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million, to mature no more than twelve years after the date of original issue of each Senior Promissory Note. Prudential has no obligation to purchase the Senior Promissory Notes. This facility expires on February 24, 2017. On March 20, 2015, the Company issued $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes to Prudential, under the shelf-loan\u201d facility, for a term of five years, at a fixed interest rate of 3.35 percent per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, of which the entire amount was outstanding at December 31, 2015. Availability under the Company's shelf-loan\u201d facility, subject to the approval of Prudential, was $100.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility, at December 31, 2015, the Company was required to maintain minimum interest and fixed charge coverages, and to meet certain other financial requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all such requirements.\nAvailability under both the Credit Agreement and the shelf-loan\u201d facilities is subject to a maximum leverage ratio covenant which limits the amount of consolidated outstanding indebtedness to 2.5 times the trailing twelve-month EBITDA, as defined in the agreements. This limitation did not impact the Company's borrowing availability at December 31, 2015. The remaining availability under these facilities was $197.3 million at December 31, 2015. The Company believes the availability under the Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility in conjunction with cash from operations is adequate to finance the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.\nAdditional information on the Company's Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility is included in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture minimum commitments relating to the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on fixed rate\nindebtedness (a)\n</td> <td>7,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>39,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts (b)\n</td> <td>15,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation (c)\n</td> <td>11,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty agreements and contingent consideration payments (d)\n</td> <td>14,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (e)\n</td> <td>587,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes (f)\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>728,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) The Company has used the contractual payment dates and the fixed interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015, to determine the estimated future interest payments for fixed rate indebtedness. \n (b) Includes amounts payable under employment contracts and arrangements, and retirement and severance agreements. \n (c) Includes amounts payable under deferred compensation arrangements.

The Company's governance documents and committee charters and key practices have been posted to the Company's website (www.drewindustries.com) and are updated periodically. The website also contains, or provides direct links to, all SEC filings, press releases and investor presentations. The Company has also established a Whistleblower Policy, which includes a toll-free hotline (877-373-9123) to report complaints about the Company's accounting, internal controls, auditing matters or other concerns. The Whistleblower Policy and procedure for complaints can be found on the Company's website (www.drewindustries.com).\nCONTINGENCIES\nAdditional information required by this item is included under Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. The following critical accounting policies, some of which are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates, affect the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies.\nInventories\nInventories (finished goods, work in process and raw materials) are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory (i.e. material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs). The Company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write-offs, taking into account future demand and market conditions. To the extent actual demand or market conditions in the future differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded inventory reserves may be required.\nSelf-Insurance\nThe Company is self-insured for certain health and workers' compensation benefits up to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred, but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by third-party claims administrators. This estimation process is subjective, and to the extent actual results differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded accruals may be required.\nWarranty\nThe Company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product sold. The Company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors, including (i) historical warranty costs, (ii) current trends, (iii) product mix, and (iv) sales. The accounting for warranty accruals requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments, and to the extent actual results differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded accruals may be required.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's tax provision is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, federal and state tax credits, and tax planning strategies. Significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the Company's tax position. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief the tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits. The Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences, which are expected to reduce future taxable income. These assets are based on management's estimate of realizability, which is reassessed each quarter based upon the Company's forecast of future taxable income. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets, and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Net Assets of Acquired Businesses\nThe Company values the assets and liabilities associated with the acquisitions of businesses on the respective acquisition dates. Depending upon the type of asset or liability acquired, the Company uses different valuation techniques in determining the fair value. Those techniques include comparable market prices, long-term sales, profitability and cash flow forecasts, assumptions regarding future industry-specific economic and market conditions, a market participant's weighted average cost of capital, as well as other techniques as circumstances required. By their nature, these assumptions require judgment, and if management had\nchosen different assumptions, the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses would have been different. For further information on acquired assets and liabilities, see Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, including Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe Company performs recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset. In the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value would be recorded.\nFor other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for other assets consists of an assessment of qualitative factors. If such qualitative factors do not support that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, the Company then uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe Company's assessment of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates management uses when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those management uses in its internal planning. When performing impairment tests, management estimates the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which is believed to be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, the Company does not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result.\nContingent Consideration Payments\nIn connection with several acquisitions, in addition to the cash paid at closing, additional payments could be required depending upon the level of sales generated from certain of the acquired products. The fair value of the aggregate estimated contingent consideration payments has been recorded as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each quarter, the Company is required to re-evaluate the fair value of the liability for the estimated contingent consideration payments for such acquisitions. The fair value of the contingent consideration payments is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. This model involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including sales of certain products, future business plans, economic projections, weighted average cost of capital, and market data. Actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nOther Estimates\nThe Company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, those related to product returns, sales and purchase rebates, accounts receivable, lease terminations, asset retirement obligations, long-lived assets, executive succession, post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, segment allocations, environmental liabilities, contingencies and litigation. Establishing reserves for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization. As a result, these estimates are based on management's current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors, as appropriate. Due to uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation required by this item is included in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nThe prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of steel and aluminum, and components used by the Company which are made from these raw materials, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities, rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures. Prices of these commodities have historically been volatile, and over the past few months prices have continued to fluctuate. The Company did not experience any significant increases in its labor costs in 2015 related to inflation.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Report.\nDrew Industries Incorporated ( Drew\u201d, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company\u201d), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Lippert Components\u201d or LCI\u201d), supplies a broad array of components in the United States and abroad for the leading manufacturers of recreational vehicles ( RVs\u201d) and manufactured homes and for the related aftermarkets of those industries. The Company also supplies components for adjacent industries including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; modular housing; and factory-built mobile office units.\nThe Company has two reportable segments: the recreational vehicle products segment (the RV Segment\u201d) and the manufactured housing products segment (the MH Segment\u201d). Intersegment sales are insignificant. At December 31, 2015, the Company operated 42 manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States and Canada.\nNet sales and operating profit were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company refined its methodology for categorizing sales within the RV Segment. This change improves accuracy, but has no impact on total RV Segment net sales or trends. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nCorporate expenses are allocated between the segments based upon net sales. Accretion related to contingent consideration and other non-segment items are included in the segment to which they relate.\nNet sales and operating profit by segment, as a percent of the total, were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\nOperating profit margin by segment was as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\nThe Company's RV Segment manufactures or distributes a variety of products used in the production of RVs, including:\n\nThe Company also supplies certain of these products to the RV aftermarket and to adjacent industries, including buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, and pontoon boats. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheels, folding camping trailers and truck campers). Approximately 73 percent of the Company's RV Segment net sales in 2015 were of products to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs accounted for 84 percent of all RVs shipped by the industry in 2015.\nThe Company's MH Segment manufactures or distributes a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes, including:\n\nThe Company also supplies certain of these products to the manufactured housing aftermarket and to adjacent industries, including modular housing and mobile office units. Certain of the Company's MH Segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes, and certain of the products manufactured by the Company are suitable for both types of homes. As a result, the Company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed.\nThe RV and manufactured housing industries, as well as other industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company's sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years.\nOver the past several years, largely due to the growth the Company has experienced in its RV Segment, the MH Segment\nis now a smaller part of the Company. MH Segment net sales were 8 percent of consolidated 2015 net sales. In addition, the Company has recently increased its focus on the significant opportunities in the aftermarket. The Company continues to evaluate the information provided to its Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), and assess how changes to its reporting structures would be used by the CODM to assess the performance of the Company's operating segments and make decisions about resource allocations. Any such changes could necessitate a revision to the operating segments the Company reports.\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND\nRecreational Vehicle Industry\nAn RV is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers).\nThe annual sales cycle for the RV industry has historically started in October after the Open House\u201d in Elkhart, Indiana where many of the largest RV OEMs display product to RV retail dealers, and ends after the conclusion of the summer selling season in September in the following calendar year. Between October and March, industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded retail sales as dealers build inventories to support anticipated sales. Between April and September, the spring and summer selling seasons, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded industry-wide wholesale shipments. Based on dealer surveys and information from wholesale finance companies, industry analysts report dealer inventories of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs are in-line with anticipated retail demand in the upcoming\nspring 2016 selling season. During 2015, wholesale sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RV exceeded retail sales by less than 1 percent, indicating dealers are managing their inventories more tightly and suggesting that changes in retail demand could more closely affect wholesale sales than in recent history.\nAccording to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ( RVIA\u201d), industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs in 2015, the Company's primary RV markets, increased 5 percent to 314,400 units compared to 2014, as a result of:\n \u2022 An estimated 35,900 unit increase in retail demand in 2015, or 13 percent, as compared to 2014. In addition, retail demand is typically revised upward in subsequent months, primarily due to delayed RV registrations. \n \u2022 RV dealers increasing inventory levels by 1,200 units in 2015.  While the Company measures its RV sales against industry-wide wholesale shipment statistics, the underlying health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand. A comparison of the number of units and the year-over-year percentage change in industry-wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc., as well as the resulting estimated change in dealer inventories, for both the United States and Canada, is as follows:\n\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhome RVs in 2015 increased 8 percent to 47,300 units compared to 2014. Retail demand for motorhome RVs also increased 12 percent in 2015, following a 16 percent increase in retail demand in 2014.\nThe RVIA has projected a modest increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs for 2016. Several RV OEM customers are introducing new product lines, additional features and adding production capacity. Retail sales of RVs historically have been closely tied to general economic conditions, as well as consumer confidence which was above historical averages in 2015. Furthermore, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have increased in 72 of the last 74 months on a year-over-year basis. Industry resources report strong attendance and high consumer interest at RV shows around the United States and Canada in late 2015 and into early 2016.\nAlthough future retail demand is inherently uncertain, RV industry fundamentals in 2015, including generally low unemployment, low fuel prices and available credit for dealers and RV consumers, were strong, as evidenced by the 13 percent increase in industry-wide retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. The Company believes the strong RV industry fundamentals, aided by product innovation, demographic tailwinds, industry promotion and the advent of stronger dealer networks, are positive signs for 2016. The Company also remains confident in its ability to exceed industry growth rates through new product introductions, market share gains, aftermarket sales, acquisitions and ongoing investments in research and development, engineering, quality and customer service.\nOver the long term, the Company expects RV industry sales to be aided by positive demographics and the continued popularity of the RV Lifestyle\u201d. The number of consumers between the ages of 55 and 70 are projected to total 56 million by 2020, 27 percent higher than in 2010, according to U.S. Census figures, and one in ten vehicle-owning households between the ages of 50 and 64 own at least one RV. The RVIA reported much of the success of the RV industry has been driven by the Baby Boomer generation. The size of that generation is beginning to wane, and younger generations, Generation X and Millennials are becoming more relevant to future industry growth. Generation X and Millennials are more diverse, requiring new and creative marketing approaches to attract them to the RV industry. The RVIA has an advertising campaign promoting the RV Lifestyle\u201d targeted at both parents aged 30 - 49 with children at home, as well as couples aged 50 - 64 with no children at home. In addition, the RV OEMs have developed more entry level units, specifically targeting younger families, in both towables and motorhomes. The popularity of traveling in RVs to NASCAR and other sporting events, more family-oriented domestic vacations, and using RVs as second homes, are trends that could continue to motivate consumer demand for RVs. RVIA studies indicate RV vacations cost significantly less than other forms of vacation travel, even when factoring in fuel prices and the cost of RV ownership. More details can be found at www.RVIA.org.\nManufactured Housing Industry\nManufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis to which axles and wheels are attached. The homes are then transported to a manufactured housing dealer which sells and transports the home to the buyer's home site. The manufactured home is installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d). The federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction, methods to site and secure the home at a home site, strength and durability, transportability, fire resistance, energy efficiency and quality. The HUD code also sets performance standards for the heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. It is the only federally regulated national building code.\nManufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. A typical section may range in size from 800 to 1,200 square feet. During 2015, multi-section homes were 54 percent of the total manufactured homes produced, consistent with 2012 - 2014. Multi-section homes averaged 64 percent of the total manufactured homes produced between 2007 - 2010. Multi-section manufactured homes generally contain more of the Company's products than single-section manufactured homes.\nThe Institute for Building Technology and Safety ( IBTS\u201d) reported industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were 70,500 units in 2015, an increase of 10 percent from 2014. For the full year 2014, there were 64,300 industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2013.\nFor the 20 years prior to the sub-prime boom in home financing, manufactured housing industry-wide wholesale shipments represented 20 percent or more of single-family housing starts. During the sub-prime years of 2003 - 2007, when low cost loans were available for financing purchases of site-built homes, many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase site-built homes instead of manufactured homes, and manufactured housing's share of the single-family market dropped to below 10 percent. Since the sub-prime bubble\u201d burst in 2007 and 2008, this market share has averaged about 11 percent, despite interest rates for manufactured home loans remaining historically high relative to interest rates for site-built home loans. Accordingly, the Company believes the manufactured housing industry may experience a modest recovery if the economy continues to improve and home buyers look at affordable housing options. However, because of the current real estate, credit and economic environment, including the availability of site built homes at stable prices and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site-built homes and loans for manufactured homes, the Company expects industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes to remain low until these conditions improve.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulate financial transactions, have made certain types of mortgages, including chattel loans, more difficult or more expensive to obtain - in particular those historically used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been reviewing this matter and legislation has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives to address this matter, there can be no assurance of the outcome.\nNevertheless, the Company believes long-term growth prospects for manufactured housing remain positive because of the quality and affordability of the home, and favorable demographic trends, including the increasing number of retirees who, in the past, had represented a significant market for manufactured homes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Highlights\n \u2022 Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to a record $1.4 billion, 18 percent higher than the year ended December 31, 2014. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2015, as well as the Furrion Limited ( Furrion\u201d) distribution and supply agreement for premium electronics (the Furrion Agreement\u201d), added $52 million in net sales in 2015. The five percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company's primary RV market, as well as increased content per unit through market share gains, positively impacted net sales growth in 2015. \n \u2022 In 2015, the Company continued to grow sales to both adjacent industries and the aftermarket for the RV and manufactured housing segments. Aggregate net sales to adjacent industries increased 40 percent to $193 million and aftermarket net sales increased 62 percent to $103 million. Together, these markets now account for 21 percent of consolidated net sales, double the percentage from 2010. \n \u2022 For the full-year 2015, the Company's net income increased to $74.3 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, up from net income of $62.3 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, in 2014. Excluding certain charges for severance, environmental and legal costs in 2015, net income would have been $79.0 million in 2015, or $3.20 per diluted share, and excluding the 2014 loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum extrusion-related assets, net income would have been $63.5 million in 2014, or $2.61 per diluted share. \n \u2022 Consolidated operating profits during 2015 increased 22 percent, to $116.3 million in 2015 from $95.5 million in 2014. Operating profit margin increased to 8.3 percent in 2015 from 8.0 percent in 2014. \n \u2022 Raw material costs continue to fluctuate. In particular, aluminum rose nearly 20 percent during the second half of 2014, and dropped during the second half of 2015. Similarly, the cost of steel used in certain of the Company's manufactured components dropped during the course of 2015; however, certain market prices have increased in early 2016 from the low points experienced during 2015. Raw material costs are expected to remain volatile. \n \u2022 During 2015 the Company completed three acquisitions: \n \u2022 Signature Seating -- A Ft. Wayne, Indiana-based manufacturer of furniture solutions for fresh water boat manufacturers, primarily pontoon boats, with annual sales of approximately $16 million; \n \u2022 Spectal Industries -- A Canada-based manufacturer of windows and doors primarily for school buses, as well as commercial buses, emergency vehicles, trucks, agricultural equipment and RVs, with annual sales of $25 million. \n \u2022 EA Technologies -- An Elkhart, Indiana-based manufacturer of custom steel and aluminum parts and provider of electro-deposition (\u2018e-coat') and powder coating services for RV, bus, medium-duty truck, automotive, recreational marine, specialty and utility trailer, and military applications, with annual sales of $17 million.  The Company plans to grow sales and leverage its purchasing power and manufacturing capabilities in addition to its engineering and design resources to improve the cost structure of the acquired operations. After funding these acquisitions in 2015, the Company believes it has access to sufficient financial capital and staff to take advantage of additional investment opportunities.\n \u2022 For 2015, the Company achieved an 18.4 percent return on equity, an improvement from the 17.5 percent return on equity in 2014. \n \u2022 In April 2015, the Company paid a special dividend of $2.00 per share, aggregating $48.2 million. \nRV Segment\nNet sales of the RV Segment in 2015 increased 20 percent, or $210 million, compared to 2014. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\n\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\n\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during 2015 exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during the same period primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2015, which acquisitions added $6 million in net sales during 2015.\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for motorhomes during 2015 exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes during the same period primarily due to market share gains and an acquisition completed in 2014, which acquisition added $8 million in net sales during 2015. Over the past few years, the Company has been expanding its product line of components for motorhomes in order to increase its customer base and market penetration, and further growth is expected.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per RV produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new RVs. The Company's average product content per type of RV, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to RV OEMs for the different types of RVs produced for the years ended December 31, divided by the industry-wide wholesale shipments of the different types of RVs for the same period, was:\n\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company refined the calculation of RV content per unit. This change improves accuracy, but has no impact on total RV Segment net sales or trends of content per unit. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nThe Company's average product content per type of RV excludes sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries. Content per RV is impacted by market share gains, acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of RVs produced industry-wide.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2015 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $20 million in net sales during 2015. With an estimated 10 million households in North America owning an RV and the Company's increasing content per unit, the Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in the RV aftermarket.\nThe Company's net sales to adjacent industries, including components for buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, and pontoon boats, increased during 2015 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2015, which acquisitions added $37 million in net sales during 2015. The Company continues to believe there are significant sales growth opportunities in adjacent industries.\nOver the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international RV sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2015. The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company has spent more than two years developing three slide-out systems suited to the needs of the European market, which were recently featured on new RV models. As a result, the Company believes it will see additional orders from European RV OEMs. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be $750 million.\nExcluding the severance charges in 2015 and the loss on sale of extrusion assets in 2014, operating profit of the RV Segment was $107.5 million in 2015, an improvement of $20.9 million, reflecting a 10 percent incremental margin compared to 2014. This increase in RV Segment operating profit was less than the Company's expected 15 to 20 percent incremental margin. The operating profit margin of the RV Segment in 2015 was adversely impacted by:\n \u2022 Fixed costs which were approximately $15 to $20 million higher than in 2014. Over the past couple of years, the Company made significant investments in manufacturing capacity, both facilities and personnel, to prepare for the expected increase in net sales in 2015 and beyond. In addition to investments in fixed costs to expand manufacturing capacity, the Company made improvements in marketing, human resources, engineering, customer service and other critical departments. The Company also added the teams from acquired businesses as well as related amortization of intangible assets. As industry-wide wholesale shipments growth has slowed from multi-year double-digit rates to mid-single-digit rates, the Company evaluated its expenses and in the fourth quarter of 2015 initiated a focused program to reduce indirect labor costs to improve operating leverage. Annual cost savings of approximately $8 to $10 million were identified and implemented late in 2015 and will come from aligning staff levels more closely to anticipated growth. \n \u2022 An increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $3.2 million due to the implementation of the new 2015 compensation program for management. \n \u2022 Sales mix changes of its products, including lower sales of fifth-wheel products. \n \u2022 A charge of $1.5 million related to environmental costs. \n \u2022 A voluntary safety recall of the Company's double and triple Coach Steps, for which the Company recorded a reserve of $1.1 million for the contingent obligation in selling, general and administrative expenses. \nPartially offset by:\n \u2022 Investments over the past several years to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies, which benefit operating results. The Company added capacity ahead of projected demand, which enabled it to efficiently fulfill customer orders as demand increased. Further, the Company has implemented additional efficiency improvements, including lean, automation and employee retention initiatives to improve operating efficiencies going forward. \n \u2022 Lower material costs for certain raw material inputs. After increasing in the latter part of 2014, steel and aluminum costs declined over the course of 2015. Nevertheless, material costs, which are subject to global supply and demand forces, remain volatile. \n \u2022 Better fixed costs absorption by spreading fixed costs over a $212 million larger sales base. \nMH Segment\nNet sales of the MH Segment in 2015 increased 2 percent, or $2 million, compared to 2014. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\n\nAccording to the IBTS, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\n\nIndustry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes increased during 2015 when compared to 2014, as well as the Company's net sales of components for new manufactured homes increased during 2015, primarily due to customer mix, as the Company's content per unit varies between customers.\nManufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. The larger homes typically contain more of the Company's products. The Company's average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to manufactured housing OEMs for newly produced manufactured homes for the years ended December 31, divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry, respectively, for the same period, was:\n\nThe Company's average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket and sales to adjacent industries. Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nOperating profit of the MH Segment was $12.5 million in 2015, an increase of $1.6 million compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in net sales from higher unit sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nConsolidated Highlights\n \u2022 Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $1.2 billion, 17 percent higher than the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the 20 percent increase in net sales of the Company's RV Segment. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2014 added $36 million in net sales in 2014. The twelve percent increase \nin industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company's primary RV market, as well as increased content per unit through market share gains, positively impacted net sales growth in 2014.\n \u2022 In 2014, the Company continued to grow both adjacent industries and the aftermarket for the RV and manufactured housing segments. Aggregate net sales to adjacent industries increased 14 percent to $138 million and aftermarket net sales increased 63 percent to $64 million. \n \u2022 For the full-year 2014, the Company's net income increased to $62.3 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, up from net income of $50.1 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, in 2013. Excluding the loss related to the sale of the Company's aluminum extrusion-related assets in 2014 and charges for executive succession in 2013, net income would have been $63.5 million in 2014, or $2.61 per diluted share, up from net income of $51.3 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, in 2013. Net income in 2014 was also impacted by facility start-up and realignment costs, which reduced net income per diluted share by approximately $0.09. \n \u2022 Consolidated operating profits during 2014 increased 22 percent, to $95.5 million in 2014 from $78.3 million in 2013. Operating profit margin increased to 8.0 percent in 2014 from 7.7 percent in 2013. As a result of facility start-up and realignment costs, as well as higher health insurance costs, the Company's incremental margin in 2014 was lower than its historical average. \n \u25aa During 2014 the Company completed four acquisitions, which added approximately $68 million of acquired annual sales, of which $36 million occurred in 2014. The four operations acquired by the Company during 2014 were: \n \u25aa Innovative Design Solutions, Inc. ( IDS\u201d) - A designer, developer and manufacturer of electronic systems encompassing a wide variety of RV, automotive, medical and industrial applications, with annual sales of $19 million, of which $15 million were to the Company; \n \u25aa Star Design, LLC ( Star Design\u201d) - A manufacturer of thermoformed sheet plastic products for the RV, bus and specialty vehicle industries, with annual sales of $10 million; \n \u25aa Power Gear\u00ae and Kwikee\u00ae brands (RV business of Actuant Corporation) - A manufacturer of leveling systems, slide-out mechanisms and steps, primarily for motorhome RVs, with annual sales of $28 million; \n \u25aa Duncan Systems, Inc. ( Duncan Systems\u201d) - A supplier of replacement motorhome windshields, awnings, and RV, heavy truck, and specialty vehicle glass and windows, primarily to fulfill insurance claims, with annual sales of $26 million. \n \u2022 For 2014, the Company achieved a 17.5 percent return on equity, an improvement from the 16.0 percent return on equity in 2013. \n \u2022 In January 2014, the Company paid a special dividend of $2.00 per share, aggregating $47 million. \nRV Segment\nNet sales of the RV Segment in 2014 increased 20 percent, or $181 million, compared to 2013. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\n\nAccording to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\n\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during 2014 exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $4 million in net sales during 2014.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2014 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $9 million in net sales during 2014. With an estimated 10 million households in North America owning an RV, the Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in the RV aftermarket.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per RV produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new RVs. The Company's average product content per type of RV, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to RV OEMs for the different types of RVs produced for the years ended December 31, divided by the industry-wide wholesale shipments of the different types of RVs for the same period, was:\n\nThe Company's average product content per type of RV excludes sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries. Content per RV is impacted by market share gains, acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of RVs produced industry-wide.\nThe Company's net sales to the RV aftermarket increased during 2014 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $15 million in net sales during 2014.\nThe Company's net sales to adjacent industries, including components for buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, truck campers and truck caps, increased during 2014 primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions completed in 2014, which acquisitions added $8 million in net sales during 2014.\nOperating profit of the RV Segment was $86.6 million in 2014, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to 2013. This increase in RV Segment operating profit was less than the Company's expected 15 to 20 percent incremental margin. The operating profit margin of the RV Segment in 2014 was adversely impacted by:\n \u2022 Higher health insurance costs, largely due to increased employee participation. \n \u2022 Fixed costs, which were approximately $15 million higher than in 2013. In response to the increase in net sales, the Company bolstered its administrative staff during 2014, including the teams that were acquired through acquisitions and new employees hired in preparation for future growth and investment opportunities.  In early 2014, the Company entered into two new leases which added more than 700,000 square feet of production and distribution capacity. These two new leased facilities became operational during the latter half of 2014 and the realignment of the related operations were completed.\nPartially offset by:\n \u2022 The elimination of production inefficiencies and costs incurred as a result of significant growth which occurred in 2012 and early 2013. \n \u2022 Lower payroll costs as a percent of sales, largely due to a reduction in state unemployment tax rates and improved employee retention. \n \u2022 Lower warranty costs as a percent of sales, largely due to lower claim experience. \n \u2022 The spreading of fixed costs over a $181 million larger sales base. \nMH Segment\nNet sales of the MH Segment in 2014 decreased 5 percent, or $6 million, compared to 2013. Net sales of components were to the following markets for the years ending December 31:\n\nAccording to the IBTS, industry-wide wholesale shipments for the years ended December 31, were:\n\nThe Company's net sales growth in components for new manufactured homes was less than the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes, primarily due to customer mix, as the Company's content per unit varies between customers, and loss of market share for certain products. Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nNet sales to the manufactured housing aftermarket increased due to market share gains.\nThe trend in the Company's average product content per manufactured home produced is an indicator of the Company's overall market share of components for new manufactured homes. Manufactured homes contain one or more floors\u201d or sections which can be joined to make larger homes. The larger homes typically contain more of the Company's products. The Company's average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry, calculated based upon the Company's net sales of components to manufactured housing OEMs for newly produced manufactured homes for the years ended December 31, divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry, respectively, for the same period, was:\n\nThe Company's average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket and sales to adjacent industries. Content per manufactured home and content per floor are impacted by market share changes, acquisitions and new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company's products, as well as changes in the types of floors produced industry-wide.\nOperating profit of the MH Segment was $10.9 million in 2014, a decrease of $1.1 million compared to 2013 primarily due to the decline in net sales.\nSale of Extrusion Assets\nIn April 2014, the Company entered into a six-year aluminum extrusion supply agreement, and concurrently sold certain aluminum extrusion assets. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 on the sale of the aluminum extrusion-related assets. In connection with the sale, the Company received $0.3 million at closing and a $7.2 million note receivable collectible over the next four years, recorded at its present value of $6.4 million on the date of closing. During 2015 and 2014, the Company received installments of $3.8 million under the note. At December 31, 2015, the present value of the remaining amount due under the note receivable was $3.2 million.\nIn July 2015, the Company agreed to terminate the supply agreement, and as consideration the Company received a $2.0 million note receivable collectible in 2019 and 2020. The Company recorded this note receivable at its present value of $1.6 million and a corresponding gain of $1.6 million in the 2015 third quarter. At December 31, 2015, the present value of the remaining amount due under the note receivable was $1.6 million.\nSeverance and Executive Succession\nIn 2015, the Company initiated a focused program to reduce indirect labor costs. In connection with this cost reduction program, the Company incurred severance charges of $3.7 million.\nIn 2013, in connection with the Company's executive succession and corporate relocation from White Plains, New York to Elkhart County, Indiana, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $1.9 million, related to contractual obligations for severance and the acceleration of equity awards held by certain employees whose employment terminated as a result of the executive succession and relocation to Indiana. The liability for executive succession and severance obligations were paid through 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for 2015 was 35.0 percent, more than the 34.5 percent in 2014. Both 2015 and 2014 benefited from federal and state tax credits, as well as the reversal of federal and state tax reserves, due to the closure of the statutes of limitation of federal and state tax years, with a larger benefit in 2014. The Company estimates the 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 35 percent to 36 percent.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2014 was 34.5 percent compared to 35.7 percent in 2013.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect the following for the years ended December 31:\n\nCash Flows from Operations\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2015 were $12.0 million lower than in 2014, primarily due to:\n \u2022 A larger increase in inventories of $9.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in inventories in 2015 was primarily due to increases in sourced products, including inventory to support the Furrion Agreement (discussed immediately below) and acquisitions completed in 2015. A portion of the increase in inventory is also due to strategic positions to take advantage of favorable market conditions and include the strategic onboarding of a new supplier. Inventory turnover for 2015 decreased to 6.9 turns compared to 8.2 turns for 2014. The Company is working to improve inventory turnover over the coming quarters, however, inventory turns may trend lower due to growth in product categories such as imported furniture and Furrion electronics. \n \u2022 In July 2015, the Company entered into a 6-year exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Furrion Limited ( Furrion\u201d), a Hong Kong based firm that designs, engineers and manufactures premium electronics. This agreement provides the Company with the rights to distribute Furrion's complete line of products to OEMs and aftermarket customers in the RV, specialty vehicle, utility trailer, horse trailer, marine, transit bus and school bus industries throughout the United States and Canada. Furrion currently supplies a premium line of LED televisions, sound systems, navigation systems, wireless backup cameras, solar prep units, power solutions and kitchen appliances, primarily to the RV industry. In connection with this agreement, the Company acquired Furrion's current inventory, as well as Furrion's deposits on inventory scheduled for delivery, for approximately $11 million. \n \u2022 A $5.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2015 compared to a $31.2 million increase in 2014, primarily due to increased imports and other prepaid inventories, efforts to increase consignments as well as the timing of purchases.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $12.1 million increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014. \n \u2022 Increases in non-cash charges against net income in 2015 including: \n \u2022 A $9.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to investments in acquisitions and capital expenditures. \n \u2022 A $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. \n \u2022 An increase in deferred taxes of $1.1 million in 2015 compared to a $5.5 million decrease in 2014 due to an increase in certain expenses currently not deductible for tax purposes in 2015.  Over the long term, based on the Company's historical collection and payment patterns, as well as inventory turnover, and also giving consideration to emerging trends and changes to the sales mix, the Company expects working capital to increase or decrease equivalent to approximately 11 to 14 percent of the increase or decrease, respectively, in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact this relationship, especially in the short term.\nDepreciation and amortization was $41.6 million in 2015, and is expected to be approximately $42 million to $47 million for fiscal year 2016. Non-cash stock-based compensation in 2015 was $16.1 million, including $2.0 million of deferred stock units issued to certain executive officers in lieu of cash for a portion of their 2014 incentive compensation in accordance with their compensation arrangements. Non-cash stock-based compensation is expected to be approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2014 were $24.3 million higher than in 2013, primarily due to:\n \u2022 A $12.1 million increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013. \n \u2022 A $24.0 million larger increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the increases in sales, production and earnings, as well as the timing of these payments. \n \u2022 An $8.5 million smaller increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in days sales outstanding to 15 at December 31, 2014, compared to 17 at December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 A $5.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2014 and capital expenditures over the last couple years.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 An $18.5 million larger increase in inventories in 2014 as compared to 2013. The larger increase in inventories in 2014 was primarily to support the 41 percent increase in net sales in January 2015. Higher raw material costs and increased lead time on imports also contributed to the increase in inventory. Inventory turnover for 2014 improved to 8.2 turns compared to 7.9 turns for 2013. \n \u2022 An increase in deferred taxes of $5.5 million in 2014 compared to a $0.3 million decrease in 2013 due to an increase in certain expenses not currently deductible for tax purposes in 2014.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities of $66.1 million in 2015 were primarily comprised of $41.1 million for the acquisition of businesses and $29.0 million for capital expenditures.\nIn January 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of EA Technologies, a manufacturer of custom steel and aluminum parts and provider of electro-deposition (\u2018e-coat') and powder coating services for RV, bus, medium-duty truck, automotive, recreational marine, specialty and utility trailer, and military applications. The purchase price was $9.2 million, of which $6.6 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the balance paid at closing.\nIn April 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Spectal, a Canada-based manufacturer of windows and doors primarily for school buses, as well as commercial buses, emergency vehicles, trucks, agricultural equipment and RVs. The purchase price was $22.3 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nIn August 2015, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Roehm Marine, LLC, also known as Signature Seating, a manufacturer of furniture solutions for fresh water boat manufacturers, primarily pontoon boats. The purchase price was $16.0 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nThe Company's capital expenditures are primarily for replacement and growth. Over the long term, based on the Company's historical capital expenditures, the replacement portion has averaged approximately 2 percent of net sales, while the growth portion has averaged approximately 10 to 12 percent of the annual increase in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact the actual spending compared to these historical averages. In 2015 capital expenditures of $29 million were in line with historical averages. However, in 2014, the Company's capital expenditures were $42.5 million, higher than the aforementioned historical averages. The increased spending was the result of several long-term growth and capacity expansion initiatives. As such, coupled with the success achieved in lean manufacturing to free up additional manufacturing space, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet the increased manufacturing demands expected for 2016 and into 2017 with capital expenditures at or below the historical levels.\nThe Company estimates capital expenditures will be $20 million to $26 million in 2016, including $11 million to $14 million of replacement\u201d capital expenditures and $9 million to $12 million of growth\u201d capital expenditures. Additional capital expenditures may be required in 2016 depending on the extent of the sales growth, the effect of any acquisitions and other initiatives by the Company.\nThe 2015 capital expenditures and acquisitions were funded by cash from operations and periodic borrowings under the Company's line of credit and $50 million of Senior Promissory Notes issued under the shelf-loan\u201d facility with Prudential. The\n2016 capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily from cash generated from operations, as well as periodic borrowings under the Company's line of credit.\nCash flows used for investing activities of $144.1 million in 2014 were primarily comprised of $42.5 million for capital expenditures and $106.8 million for the acquisition of businesses.\nIn February 2014, the Company acquired IDS, a designer, developer and manufacturer of electronic systems encompassing a wide variety of RV applications. IDS also manufactures electronic systems for automotive, medical and industrial applications. The purchase price was $35.9 million, of which $34.2 million was paid at closing, with the balance to be paid out annually over the subsequent three years, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nIn March 2014, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Star Design, which manufactures thermoformed sheet plastic products for the RV, bus and specialty vehicle industries. The purchase price was $12.2 million paid at closing.\nIn June 2014, the Company acquired the RV business of Actuant Corporation, which manufactures leveling systems, slide-out mechanisms and steps, primarily for motorhome RVs, under the Power Gear and Kwikee brands. The purchase price was $35.5 million, paid at closing.\nIn August 2014, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Duncan Systems, an aftermarket distributor of replacement motorhome windshields, awnings, and RV, heavy truck and specialty vehicle glass and windows, primarily to fulfill insurance claims. The purchase price was $18.0 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales of this operation.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash flows used by financing activities in 2015 included the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $48.2 million, paid to stockholders of record as of March 27, 2015, partially offset by a net increase in indebtedness of $34.4 million. The increase in indebtedness includes new debt comprised of $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes drawn in March 2015 under the Prudential Investment Management, Inc. shelf-loan\u201d facility, partially offset by a $15.7 million decrease in debt due to paying down the Company's line of credit. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of December 31, 2015, but borrowings reached a high of $71.6 million during 2015. In addition, the Company made $4.0 million in payments for contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\nCash flows used for financing activities in 2014 included the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $46.7 million, paid to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2013, partially offset by a net increase in indebtedness of $15.6 million. The increase in indebtedness was due to borrowings under the Company's line of credit. In addition, in 2014, the Company received $5.8 million in cash and the related tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation, offset by $3.7 million in payments for contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\nIn connection with certain business acquisitions, if established sales targets for the acquired products are achieved, the Company is contractually obligated to pay additional cash consideration. The Company has recorded a $10.8 million liability for the aggregate fair value of these expected contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2015, including $3.9 million recorded as a current liability. For further information, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 24, 2014, the Company entered into a $75.0 million line of credit (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., amending an existing facility first entered into in 2008. On March 3, 2015, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its line of credit by $25.0 million to $100.0 million. The Credit Agreement expires on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $2.7 million in standby letters of credit under the line of credit primarily to secure certain insurance arrangements. Availability under the Company's line of credit was $97.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nOn February 24, 2014, the Company also entered into a $150.0 million shelf-loan\u201d facility with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and its affiliates ( Prudential\u201d). The facility provides for Prudential to consider purchasing, at the Company's request, in one or a series of transactions, Senior Promissory Notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million, to mature no more than twelve years after the date of original issue of each Senior Promissory Note. Prudential has no obligation to purchase the Senior Promissory Notes. This facility expires on February 24, 2017. On March 20, 2015, the Company issued $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes to Prudential, under the shelf-loan\u201d facility, for a term of five years, at a fixed interest rate of 3.35 percent per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, of which the entire amount was outstanding at December 31, 2015. Availability under the Company's shelf-loan\u201d facility, subject to the approval of Prudential, was $100.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility, at December 31, 2015, the Company was required to maintain minimum interest and fixed charge coverages, and to meet certain other financial requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all such requirements.\nAvailability under both the Credit Agreement and the shelf-loan\u201d facilities is subject to a maximum leverage ratio covenant which limits the amount of consolidated outstanding indebtedness to 2.5 times the trailing twelve-month EBITDA, as defined in the agreements. This limitation did not impact the Company's borrowing availability at December 31, 2015. The remaining availability under these facilities was $197.3 million at December 31, 2015. The Company believes the availability under the Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility in conjunction with cash from operations is adequate to finance the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.\nAdditional information on the Company's Credit Agreement and shelf-loan\u201d facility is included in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture minimum commitments relating to the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 were as follows:\n\n (a) The Company has used the contractual payment dates and the fixed interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015, to determine the estimated future interest payments for fixed rate indebtedness. \n (b) Includes amounts payable under employment contracts and arrangements, and retirement and severance agreements. \n (c) Includes amounts payable under deferred compensation arrangements. The Other column represents the liability for deferred compensation for employees that have elected to receive payment upon separation from service from the Company. \n (d) Comprised of estimated future contingent consideration payments for which a liability has been recorded in connection with business acquisitions over the past few years. \n (e) Primarily comprised of (i) purchase orders issued in the normal course of business and (ii) long term purchase commitments, for which the Company has estimated the expected future obligation based on current prices and usage. \n (f) Represents unrecognized tax benefits, as well as related interest and penalties. \nThese commitments are described more fully in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Company is in compliance with the corporate governance requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and the New York Stock Exchange. The Company's governance documents and committee charters and key practices have been posted to the Company's website (www.drewindustries.com) and are updated periodically. The website also contains, or provides direct links to, all SEC filings, press releases and investor presentations. The Company has also established a Whistleblower Policy, which includes a toll-free hotline (877-373-9123) to report complaints about the Company's accounting, internal controls, auditing matters or other concerns. The Whistleblower Policy and procedure for complaints can be found on the Company's website (www.drewindustries.com).\nCONTINGENCIES\nAdditional information required by this item is included under Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. The following critical accounting policies, some of which are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates, affect the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies.\nInventories\nInventories (finished goods, work in process and raw materials) are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory (i.e. material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs). The Company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write-offs, taking into account future demand and market conditions. To the extent actual demand or market conditions in the future differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded inventory reserves may be required.\nSelf-Insurance\nThe Company is self-insured for certain health and workers' compensation benefits up to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred, but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by third-party claims administrators. This estimation process is subjective, and to the extent actual results differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded accruals may be required.\nWarranty\nThe Company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product sold. The Company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors, including (i) historical warranty costs, (ii) current trends, (iii) product mix, and (iv) sales. The accounting for warranty accruals requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments, and to the extent actual results differ from original estimates, adjustments to recorded accruals may be required.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's tax provision is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, federal and state tax credits, and tax planning strategies. Significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the Company's tax position. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief the tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits. The Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences, which are expected to reduce future taxable income. These assets are based on management's estimate of realizability, which is reassessed each quarter based upon the Company's forecast of future taxable income. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets, and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Net Assets of Acquired Businesses\nThe Company values the assets and liabilities associated with the acquisitions of businesses on the respective acquisition dates. Depending upon the type of asset or liability acquired, the Company uses different valuation techniques in determining the fair value. Those techniques include comparable market prices, long-term sales, profitability and cash flow forecasts, assumptions regarding future industry-specific economic and market conditions, a market participant's weighted average cost of capital, as well as other techniques as circumstances required. By their nature, these assumptions require judgment, and if management had\nchosen different assumptions, the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses would have been different. For further information on acquired assets and liabilities, see Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, including Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe Company performs recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset. In the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value would be recorded.\nFor other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for other assets consists of an assessment of qualitative factors. If such qualitative factors do not support that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, the Company then uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe Company's assessment of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates management uses when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those management uses in its internal planning. When performing impairment tests, management estimates the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which is believed to be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, the Company does not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result.\nContingent Consideration Payments\nIn connection with several acquisitions, in addition to the cash paid at closing, additional payments could be required depending upon the level of sales generated from certain of the acquired products. The fair value of the aggregate estimated contingent consideration payments has been recorded as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each quarter, the Company is required to re-evaluate the fair value of the liability for the estimated contingent consideration payments for such acquisitions. The fair value of the contingent consideration payments is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. This model involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including sales of certain products, future business plans, economic projections, weighted average cost of capital, and market data. Actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nOther Estimates\nThe Company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, those related to product returns, sales and purchase rebates, accounts receivable, lease terminations, asset retirement obligations, long-lived assets, executive succession, post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, segment allocations, environmental liabilities, contingencies and litigation. Establishing reserves for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization. As a result, these estimates are based on management's current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors, as appropriate. Due to uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation required by this item is included in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nThe prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of steel and aluminum, and components used by the Company which are made from these raw materials, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities, rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures. Prices of these commodities have historically been volatile, and over the past few months prices have continued to fluctuate. The Company did not experience any significant increases in its labor costs in 2015 related to inflation.", "item_7_tables": "Table 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

increased 18% to a record $1.4 billion, driven by growth in the RV segment. RV sales were helped by 5% industry growth and market share gains. Aftermarket and adjacent industry sales now make up 21% of revenue, doubling since 2010. \n\n- Net income increased 19% in 2015 to $74.3 million. Excluding one-time items, adjusted net income grew 21%. \n\n- Operating profit margin increased to 8.3% from 8.0%. Margin was impacted by higher fixed costs, stock comp expenses, and other items, partially offset by lower material costs.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $95 million. The company invested $66 million in acquisitions and $29 million in capital expenditures. Debt increased $34 million.  \n\n- RV segment sales grew 20%, outpacing 12% industry growth, due to market share gains and acquisitions. Aftermarket sales grew 76%.\n\n- MH segment sales grew 2%, as industry shipments increased 10%. Content per unit declined due to customer mix. \n\n- The company expects continued growth in 2016 supported by strong industry fundamentals, though at a slower pace than the multi-year double digit growth. Incremental margins are expected to improve."}
