We and our subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the Company,\u201d ascena,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and ourselves,\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise.\nObjectives and Initiatives\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels and patterns of consumer spending. Some of the factors that could negatively impact discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, reductions in net worth, higher energy and other prices, increasing interest rates and low consumer confidence.\nRetailers, particularly those in the specialty apparel sector, continue to face intense competition and channel disruption as consumer spending habits continue to indicate an increasing preference to purchase digitally as opposed to in traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. While our comparative sales performance improved in the latter half of Fiscal 2018, competition for consumer spending remains strong and we expect a highly competitive operating environment to continue into Fiscal 2019. In response to this expected operating environment, we continue to scale back overall spending levels where possible, refine our operating model and implement new capabilities to ensure we remain competitive in this rapidly evolving sector. The more significant of these initiatives are described below.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nChange for Growth Program\nOver the last two fiscal years, we have undergone a substantial transformation program with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing shareholder value (the \"Change for Growth\" program). In connection with the program, we (i) implemented a number of initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, (ii) conducted a review of our store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of marginally profitable stores through either rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store footprint and convert sales from these stores into direct channel sales or to nearby store locations, (iii) began to develop new capabilities such as markdown optimization, size pack optimization and localized inventory planning, and (iv) enhanced our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions. Charges incurred as a result of these actions are described within the section Results of Operations.\nWe realized approximately $135 million in cost savings in Fiscal 2018, including $105 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), $15 million in Buying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\"), and $15 million in Cost of goods sold, related to Change for Growth program activity. We expect to realize approximately $100 to $125 million in incremental cost savings through Fiscal 2020, bringing the total expected cost savings from these activities, when combined with the $65 million cost savings achieved during Fiscal 2017, to approximately $300 to $325 million. These cost savings are achieved through (i) operating expense reductions in the areas of professional services, travel and facilities management, among others, (ii) refinement of our operating model to eliminate duplicative overhead, and increase utilization of our brand services functions, (iii) creating a platform that reduces product costs and improves information technology efficiencies and (iv) reduced rent expense resulting from store closures or negotiated rent reductions. These cost savings are expected to be realized in our segment operating results generally in proportion to their sales, and serve to offset ongoing inflationary pressure and required reinvestment to support key incremental business initiatives.\nWe may incur significant additional charges and capital expenditures in future periods as we continue our efforts under the Change for Growth program, which include completing actions already started, more fully define related Change for Growth program initiatives and moving into the execution phases of those associated projects. Since the scope of such efforts are not fully known at this time, the benefits of such initiatives, and any related charges or capital expenditures, are not currently quantifiable. Actions associated with the Change for Growth program are currently expected to continue through Fiscal 2019.\nIntegration of ANN\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we substantially completed our integration of ANN INC. (\"ANN\" or the \"ANN integration\") into our existing operations and realized cost savings of approximately $45 million during Fiscal 2018, with approximately $25 million related to our ongoing Cost of goods sold initiative at our Premium Fashion segment and approximately $20 million in SG&A synergies primarily related to non-merchandise procurement savings. We expect to realize additional synergies related to the integration of approximately $30 million, which are expected to be substantially realized in Fiscal 2019. Once completed, we continue to expect that the total synergies and cost savings related to the ANN integration, including amounts achieved from Fiscal 2016 through Fiscal 2019, will be approximately $235 million.\nDistribution and Fulfillment\nOver the last few years, (i) our brands' distribution and fulfillment capability was centralized into our brick-and-mortar store distribution facility in Etna, Ohio and our direct channel fulfillment facility in Greencastle, Indiana which has resulted in increased processing efficiencies, and (ii) we entered into a lease agreement for a distribution center in Riverside, California to serve as the receiving and west coast distribution hub for merchandise sourced from Asia. During Fiscal 2018, we completed the expansion of our Riverside facility to include both brick-and-mortar and direct channel distribution, and we introduced direct fulfillment capability at our Etna facility to further increase our capacity in this growing channel. We continue to explore ways to optimize and leverage our integrated distribution network, which may include providing such services to third parties.\nSourcing\nOur brands source their products through a variety of sourcing channels including internally through our ascena Global Sourcing (\"aGS\") subsidiary and externally through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends. We continue to increase the penetration of internally sourced products and manage our relationships with third-party buying agents.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOmni-channel Expansion\nWe continue to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel strategies. During Fiscal 2018, we also expanded the functionality of our Riverside, California distribution center and it now supports both our brick-and-mortar and direct channel operations. During Fiscal 2018, we continued to develop technology solutions which will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur individual segments are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back-to-school shopping periods. In particular, sales at our Kids Fashion segment tend to be significantly higher during the fall season, which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, as this includes the back-to-school period and the December holiday season. Our Plus Fashion segment tends to experience higher sales during the spring season, which include the Easter and Mother's Day holidays. Our Premium Fashion and Value Fashion segments have relatively balanced sales across the Fall and Spring seasons. As a result, our operational results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFiscal Period\nAs disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we recognized an additional week during Fiscal 2018 as we conformed our fiscal calendar to that of the National Retail Federation.\nPerformance of the Value Fashion segment\nDuring Fiscal 2018, in connection with the Company's ongoing review of the Value Fashion segment, the Company made certain senior management changes in the segment with a view towards improving its performance. This review resulted in additional clearance markdowns to improve inventory composition as of the end of Fiscal 2018, as well as impairment charges related to certain under-performing retail store assets. The Company plans to continue to pursue initiatives to improve the segment's performance and to optimize shareholder value.\nImpact of Hurricanes\nDuring the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, our business was impacted by three hurricanes that disrupted normal operations at approximately 600 of our retail stores in the south-central and southeast areas of the United States, as well as Puerto Rico. These stores were impacted by the hurricanes, either as a result of damage incurred or declines in customer traffic. Almost all of the stores damaged in the hurricanes have resumed operations. We have substantially completed our assessment of the damages associated with these events and estimate that our results were negatively impacted by approximately $11 million of sales losses, a portion of which may be recovered through business interruption insurance claims. As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we have received approximately $2 million in recoveries from these insurance claims. Other than the impact of the sales losses, the hurricanes did not have a material impact on our business or results from operations.\nSummary and Key Developments\nOur Fiscal 2018 operating results were impacted by a decline in store traffic and a more promotional selling environment, along with under-performance at the dressbarn brand which led to non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets and incremental markdowns to sell through excess inventory. These items were partially mitigated by improved operating results in our Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion segments, costs and savings related to our Change for Growth program and costs and synergies from the continued integration of our Premium Fashion segment, which was acquired in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

Net sales decreased by $71.5 million, or 1.1%, to $6,578.3 million in Fiscal 2018 from $6,649.8 million in the year-ago period. The decline in net sales primarily reflected a 2% decline in comparable sales that mainly resulted from a 6.7% decline in net sales at our Value Fashion segment, as well as product assortment challenges during the first half of Fiscal 2018 experienced by the Premium Fashion segment, which returned to positive comp performance in the second half of Fiscal 2018. Non-comparable sales declined by $73.0 million, or 37.1%, to $123.6 million from $196.6 million, as discussed on a segment basis below. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues increased by $5.2 million, or 2.5%, to $212.8 million from $207.6 million.

Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in stores only open in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Direct channel sales refer to growth of sales from our direct channel in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year. Due to customer cross-channel behavior, we report a single, consolidated comparable sales metric, inclusive of store and direct channels.\n(b) Incremental revenues of approximately $113.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 are excluded from the calculation of comparable sales.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>During Fiscal 2018, vouchers distributed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 in connection with the Justice pricing litigation, discussed more fully in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, began to be redeemed.

Gross margin, in terms of dollars decreased as a result of the decline in comparable sales as well as a decline in gross margin rate. Gross margin rate, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in Fiscal 2018 from 58.0% in Fiscal 2017. Improved performance at our Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion segments was offset by declines at our Premium Fashion and Value Fashion segments. On a consolidated basis, gross margin reflects higher shipping costs of approximately $43 million across the segments as a result of an increased mix of direct channel sales and higher air freight costs, offset by the realization of approximately $40 million in synergies and cost savings benefits achieved from product sourcing and transportation costs.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period.\nGross margin rate highlights on a segment basis are as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Premium Fashion gross margin rate performance declined by approximately 60 basis points, reflecting higher shipping costs related to increased direct channel penetration and an increased level of promotional selling resulting from soft product acceptance during the first half of Fiscal 2018, offset in part by the segment's cost of goods sold initiative.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Value Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 150 basis, points caused primarily by a 280 basis point decline at dressbarn. The decline mainly reflects higher markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels, a higher level of promotional selling, particularly at dressbarn, due to lower than expected customer demand, and higher shipping costs related to the increased direct channel penetration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Plus Fashion gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 30 basis points, reflecting improved product acceptance and lower levels of promotional selling, offset in part by higher shipping costs related to the increased direct channel penetration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Kids Fashion gross margin rate performance improved approximately 90 basis points, resulting from improved product acceptance, offset in part by incremental freight expenses necessary to meet higher product demand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBuying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\") expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses increased by $6.8 million, or 0.5%, to $1,281.1 million in Fiscal 2018 from $1,274.3 million in Fiscal 2017. Higher buying costs and variable distribution costs related to the increased penetration of our direct channel business were partly offset by lower occupancy expenses related to our fleet optimization program, which provided approximately $15 million of cost savings during Fiscal 2018. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 30 basis points to 19.5% in Fiscal 2018 from 19.2% in Fiscal 2017, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $31.8 million, or 1.5%, to $2,036.7 million in Fiscal 2018 from $2,068.5 million in Fiscal 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to approximately $125 million in synergies and cost reduction initiatives, mainly reflecting headcount and non-merchandise procurement savings. Also contributing to the decrease were lower store expenses, resulting from the fleet optimization program, and lower performance-based compensation. These items were offset in part by inflationary increases, higher write-downs of store related fixed assets, primarily at the Value Fashion segment, and the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 recorded for all of the segments. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nby 10 basis points to 31.0% in Fiscal 2018 from 31.1% in Fiscal 2017, and reflects the impact of the reduced expenses, offset in part by the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $29.4 million, or 7.6%, to $355.5 million in Fiscal 2018 from $384.9 million in Fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in store count resulting from our fleet optimization program, offset in part by incremental depreciation from capital investments.\nOperating income (loss). Operating income was $34.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared to an operating loss of $1,313.8 million in Fiscal 2017 and is discussed on a segment basis below.\nOperating results for our four operating segments are presented below.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kids Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated acquisition and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(596.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>596.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(728.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,313.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,348.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nPremium Fashion operating income decreased by $5.7 million primarily due to lower comparable sales and gross margin rate as discussed above, offset in part by a decrease in SG&A expenses. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation, and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nValue Fashion operating results decreased by $95.4 million primarily due to lower comparable sales and gross margin rate, as discussed above, and an increase in SG&A expenses, which were offset in part by lower BD&O expenses. The lower BD&O expenses primarily reflect lower occupancy expenses associated with our fleet optimization program. The higher SG&A expenses primarily reflect higher non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets as previously discussed, offset in part by a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nPlus Fashion operating income increased by $11.6 million primarily due to an increase in the gross margin rate, as discussed above, and a decrease in SG&A expenses, which were offset in part by higher BD&O expenses and a decrease in comparable sales, also discussed above. The higher BD&O expenses primarily reflect the increased penetration of our direct channel business. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by a decrease in administrative payroll costs, lower marketing expenses, and other cost savings initiatives, mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nKids Fashion operating income increased by $75.8 million primarily due to an increase in comparable sales and gross margin rate, as discussed above, as well as lower SG&A expenses. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by lower store expenses associated with our fleet optimization program, lower marketing expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nUnallocated acquisition and integration expenses of $5.4 million for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's distribution operations, including the closure of the former ANN distribution facility in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the gain on the related sale of that facility, which occurred in Fiscal 2018. The $39.4 million of unallocated acquisition and integration expenses in Fiscal 2017 represents costs related to the ANN Acquisition consisting of $14.3\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nmillion of severance and retention costs, $8.0 million of settlement charges and professional fees related to the termination of the pension plan acquired in the ANN Acquisition, and $17.1 million of other costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's operations.\nUnallocated restructuring and other related charges reflects costs incurred under the Change for Growth program. Expenses of $78.5 million for Fiscal 2018 included $59.2 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of transformation initiatives, $5.2 million of severance and other related expenses, and asset impairments of $14.1 million reflecting decisions within the fleet optimization program to close certain under-performing stores as well as a write-down of a building. The $81.9 million of unallocated restructuring and other related charges in Fiscal 2017 represents $33.2 million of severance and other related expenses, $15.3 million for charges related to fleet optimization program and $33.4 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of transformation initiatives.\nUnallocated impairment of goodwill reflects the Fiscal 2017 write-down of the carrying values of the reporting units to their fair values and is included in our operating segments as follows: $428.9 million at our Premium Fashion segment, $107.2 million at our Value Fashion segment and $60.2 million at our Plus Fashion segment. There was no unallocated impairment of goodwill in Fiscal 2018.\nUnallocated impairment of intangible assets reflects the Fiscal 2017 write-down of our trade name intangible assets to their fair values as follows: $210.0 million of our Ann Taylor trade name, $356.3 million of our LOFT trade name and $161.8 million of our Lane Bryant trade name. There was no unallocated impairment of intangible assets in Fiscal 2018.\nInterest expense increased by $10.8 million to $113.0 million for Fiscal 2018 from $102.2 million in Fiscal 2017, primarily caused by a higher interest rate on our term loan.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. During Fiscal 2018, the company made repayments of $180.0 million which were applied towards future scheduled quarterly payments of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan debt, resulting in a $5.0 million pre-tax loss reflecting the acceleration of deferred financing fees.\nBenefit for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. We recorded a benefit of $41.8 million in Fiscal 2018 on a pre-tax loss of $81.5 million, for an effective tax rate of 51.3%, which reflects the provisional impact of recording the tax effects associated with the 2017 Act discussed in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. This was offset by the impact of recording a valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets also discussed in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accounting for the tax effects of share-based compensation discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In Fiscal 2017, we recorded a benefit of $346.9 million on a pre-tax loss of $1,414.2 million for a 24.5% effective tax rate. The effective annual tax rate for Fiscal 2017 is lower than the statutory federal and state tax rate primarily as $526.5 million of the impairment of goodwill is non-deductible for income tax purposes and is treated as a permanent difference.\nNet loss decreased to $39.7 million in Fiscal 2018 from $1,067.3 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, net of the related income tax benefit, recorded in the year-ago period as discussed above.\nNet loss per diluted common share was to $0.20 per share in Fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of $5.48 per share in the year-ago period due to lower net loss discussed above.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -

Net sales decreased by $345.6 million, or 4.9%, to $6,649.8 million in Fiscal 2017 from $6,995.4 million in Fiscal 2016. The decline in net sales primarily reflected a 5% decline in comparable sales which was offset in part by three additional weeks of net sales for the Premium Fashion segment in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 which included only the 49-week post-acquisition period. The comparable sales decline resulted from reduced store traffic. Non-comparable sales decreased by $23.5 million, or 14.0%, to $144.2 million from $167.7 million, as discussed on a segment basis below. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues increased by $8.8 million, or 6.1%, to $152.2 million from $143.4 million. Also contributing to the decline was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016, which represented an incremental $82 million in net sales in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales data for our four operating segments is presented below.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Premium Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,322.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,330.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Value Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,094.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Plus Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,463.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Kids Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,023.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,649.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,995.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(345.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable sales (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and direct channel sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in stores only open in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Direct channel sales refer to growth of sales from our direct channel in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year. Due to customer cross-channel behavior, we report a single, consolidated comparable sales metric, inclusive of store and direct channels.\nPremium Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a 52-week period compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a 7% comparable sales decline at Ann Taylor and a 4% comparable sales decline at LOFT; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>18 net store closures at Ann Taylor and 4 net store closures at LOFT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValue Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a 9% comparable sales decline of $88.7 million at maurices and a 5% comparable sales decline of $46.6 million at dressbarn;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $22.4 million increase in non-comparable sales due to 12 net store openings at maurices, offset in part by a $19.8 million decline in non-comparable sales due to 30 net store closures at dressbarn;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $34.5 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $22.8 million increase in other revenues primarily due to the segment's new private label credit card program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPlus Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a 7% comparable sales decline of $67.3 million at Lane Bryant and a 4% comparable sales decline of $11.3 million at Catherines;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $2.3 million decline in non-comparable sales due to 8 net store closures at Lane Bryant and 14 net store closures at Catherines;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $23.0 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.8 million decline in other revenues due to lower revenue from product sell-off and gift card breakage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKids Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a 3% comparable sales decline of $26.3 million at Justice;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $23.8 million decline in non-comparable sales caused by 37 net store closures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $24.9 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $8.2 million decline in other revenues due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nGross margin. Gross margin rate, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased by 180 basis points from 56.2% in Fiscal 2016 to 58.0% in Fiscal 2017. The increase was due to an approximate $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory to fair market value recorded during Fiscal 2016 in our Premium Fashion segment. Excluding the prior year impact of the inventory amortization, gross margin rate was essentially flat, as improved performance at our Premium Fashion and Plus Fashion segments was offset by declines at our Value Fashion and Kids Fashion segments. On a consolidated basis, gross margin benefited from the realization of approximately $55 million in combined integration synergies and cost savings related to our ongoing supply chain integration and the cost of goods sold initiatives at its Premium Fashion segment.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period.\nGross margin rate highlights on a segment basis are as follows:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Premium Fashion gross margin rate performance reflected an approximate $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory recorded during Fiscal 2016 discussed above.

There was no unallocated impairment of intangible assets in Fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense decreased by $1.1 million to $102.2 million for Fiscal 2017.

During Fiscal 2016, we repurchased $72.0 million of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan debt at an aggregate cost of $68.4 million through open market transactions, resulting in a $0.8 million pre-tax gain, net of the proportional write-off of unamortized original issuance discount and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The benefit (provision) for income taxes increased by $350.5 million to a benefit of $346.9 million in Fiscal 2017 from a provision of $3.6 million in Fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was 24.5% for Fiscal 2017 and negative 43.4% for Fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate computing the benefit on the pre-tax loss for Fiscal 2017 is lower than the statutory federal and state tax rate primarily as $526.5 million of the goodwill impairment charge is non-deductible for income tax purposes and is treated as a permanent difference. The negative effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 despite a net loss was primarily due to state and local taxes and certain expenses which were non-deductible for income tax purposes.\nNet loss increased by $1,055.4 million to $1,067.3 million in Fiscal 2017 from $11.9 million in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as lower operating results discussed above.\nNet loss per diluted common share increased by $5.42 to $5.48 per share in Fiscal 2017 from $0.06 per share in Fiscal 2016 due to the higher net loss discussed above.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years presented as follows:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(268.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $273.9 million for Fiscal 2018, compared with $343.6 million during the year-ago period. Cash provided by operations was lower during Fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower net income before non-cash expenses and higher working capital outflows in Fiscal 2018, primarily related to timing of payments for store rent expense of approximately $50 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $134.4 million, compared with $268.9 million for the year-ago period. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $186.3 million, offset in part by $52.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, which substantially reflects the redemption of cash surrender value on certain company-owned life insurance policies. Net cash used in investing activities in the year-ago period was $268.9 million, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $258.1 million and the purchase of an intangible asset of $11.6 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $343.6 million for Fiscal 2017, compared with $445.4 million during Fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operations was lower during Fiscal 2017 as lower net income and unfavorable working capital outflows related to timing of payments and lower incentive compensation accruals were offset in part by cash used for non-recurring payments made during Fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting an escrow payment of approximately $51 million for the Justice pricing litigation settlement and a payment of approximately $44 million to a former Justice executive.\nNet cash used in investing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $1,494.6 million of cash paid in the ANN Acquisition and cash used for capital expenditures of $366.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments of $25.4 million.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $120.9 million during Fiscal 2017, consisting primarily of principal repayments of our term loan debt. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,521.5 million during Fiscal 2016, consisting primarily of $1,764.0 million of borrowing under our new term loan, offset in part by net repayments of debt under our amended revolving credit agreement of $116.0 million, $77.4 million of redemptions and principal repayments of our term loan debt and $42.6 million of payments made for deferred financing costs related to the new borrowing arrangements entered into during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nCapital Spending\nIn Fiscal 2018, we had $186.3 million in capital expenditures, which included spending for non-routine capital investments including our omni-channel platform and initiatives identified with the Change for Growth program, as well as routine spending in connection with our digital initiatives, infrastructure, and our retail store network. The most significant non-routine initiatives are described below.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we continued to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel capability. We completed the expansion of our Riverside, California facility to include the direct channel, as well as brick-and-mortar distribution. Additionally, during Fiscal 2018, we continued to develop technology solutions which will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support more effective product and marketing decisions. Also, in connection with the Change for Growth program, we spent approximately $40 million in Fiscal 2018 and expect to spend approximately $30 million in Fiscal 2019 on projects to improve operational efficiency and enhance our customer-facing capabilities.\nWe expect that total capital spending for Fiscal 2019, including (i) routine spending, (ii) technological spending for the projects discussed above, and (iii) spending required to support the Change for Growth program, will be in the range of $180-$210 million. Our routine and non-routine capital requirements are expected to be funded primarily with available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and, to the extent necessary, borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement which is defined and discussed below.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from our operations, remaining availability under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement after taking into account outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and the collateral limitation, and available cash and cash equivalents. These sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, retail store expansion, construction and renovation of stores, investment in technological and supply chain infrastructure, acquisitions, debt servicing requirements, stock repurchases, dividends, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our operating needs, capital requirements and any debt service requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAs of August 4, 2018, approximately $44 million, or 18%, of our available cash and cash equivalents was held overseas by our foreign subsidiaries, which represents a significant reduction in our offshore cash balance from Fiscal 2017. The 2017 Act eliminated the deferral of the U.S. tax liability on offshore earnings and profits, and subjected those earnings to tax under the Transition Tax rules that were part of the 2017 Act. The assessment of the Transition Tax meant that our offshore cash and offshore earnings could be repatriated at minimal tax cost. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we repatriated approximately $273 million of our foreign cash back to the U.S. Any remaining offshore cash balances are required to meet the working capital needs of the Company's offshore businesses or are subject to foreign exchange control regulations. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for our remaining foreign held cash balances and will repatriate any excess cash balances as necessary.\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had $472.9 million of availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nDebt\nFor a detailed description of the terms and restrictions under our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated February 27, 2018 (the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\") and the $1.8 billion seven-year term loan (the \"Term Loan\"), see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAmended Revolving Credit Agreement\nWe believe that our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. We were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement as of August 4, 2018. The Amended Revolving Credit Agreement extends the maturity of the Company's revolving credit facility from August 2020 to the earlier of (i) 5 years from the closing date (or February 2023) or (ii) 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Term Loans (unless (a) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans is $150 million or less and (b) the Company maintains liquidity (which can include (1) availability under the credit facility in excess of the greater of $100 million and 20% of the credit limit and (2) cash held in a controlled account of the administrative agent of the revolving credit facility) in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the remaining Term Loans, as described in more detail in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to continue to support our operating needs and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nTerm Loan\nFor Fiscal 2018, we repaid a total of $225.0 million term loan debt of which $180.0 million was applied to future quarterly scheduled payments such that we are not required to make a quarterly payment until November of Fiscal 2021. We may from time to time seek to repay or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt arrangements, among other factors.\nAdditionally, we expect to incur cash interest expense of approximately $91 million on the Term Loan in Fiscal 2019 based on the outstanding balance and interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018. Such interest and principal payments are expected to be funded with our cash flows from operations.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThere were no purchases of common stock during Fiscal 2018 under the repurchase program. For a complete description of our 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe may from time to time continue to repurchase additional shares depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt agreements, among other factors.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of August 4, 2018, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

See Notes 15 and 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table, including obligations under employment agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit amounted to approximately $27.1 million as of August 4, 2018. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe are exposed to a variety of market-based risks, representing our potential exposure to losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. These market risks include, but are not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our Canadian operations, changes in interest rates, and changes in both the value and liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, in the normal course of business, we employ a number of established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including considering, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks. However, as a matter of policy, we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we did not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe currently do not have any significant risks related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Purchases of inventory for resale in our retail stores and direct channel operations normally are transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, our 100% owned international retail operations represent approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. In the future, if our international operations continue to expand, we may consider the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage any significant risks to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had $1,371.5 million in variable-rate debt outstanding under our borrowing agreements. Accordingly, we remain subject to changes in interest rates. For each 0.125% increase or decrease in interest rates, our interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $1.7 million, and net income would decrease or increase, respectively, by approximately $1.3 million. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms and conditions of our borrowing agreements.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $238.9 million. We maintain cash deposits and cash equivalents with well-known and stable financial institutions; however, there were significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at overseas financial institutions as well as FDIC-insured financial institutions that were in excess of FDIC-insured limits at the end of Fiscal 2018. This represents a concentration of credit risk. While there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date, we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe SEC's Financial Reporting Release No. 60, \"Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies\" (\"FRR 60\"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our operational results and financial position and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents the critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nRetail Inventory Method\nWe hold inventory for sale through our retail stores and direct channel sites. All of our segments, other than Premium Fashion discussed below, use the retail inventory method of accounting, under which inventory is stated at the lower of cost, on a First In, First Out ( FIFO\u201d) basis, or market. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. Inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including, among others, initial merchandise markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.\nWe continuously review the inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and markdowns necessary to clear slow-moving merchandise, which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value. Consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns, aging of inventories, historical sales trends, and the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, as well as changes in consumer preferences, market and economic conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs and the markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results.\nWeighted-average Cost Method\nThe Premium Fashion segment uses the weighted-average cost method to value inventory, under which inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market, at the individual item level. Inventory cost is adjusted when the current selling price or future estimated selling price is less than cost.\nReserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nTo assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, we review and consider an appraisal from an independent valuation firm. Estimates of fair value are determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and the timing of those cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. Estimating the fair value is judgmental in nature, which could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe fair values of the reporting units are determined using a combination of the income approach (the discounted cash flows method) and the market approach (guideline public company method and guideline transaction method). We believe that the income approach is the most reliable indication of value as it captures forecasted revenues and earnings for the reporting units in the projection period that the market approach may not directly incorporate. Therefore, a greater weighting was applied to the income approach than the market approach.\nThe assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting units identified for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment for all periods presented are ANN, Justice, Lane Bryant, maurices, dressbarn and Catherines, each of which represents the lowest level where discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment managers.\nFiscal 2018 Impairment Assessment\nIn the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we performed our annual impairment assessment (the \"Fiscal 2018 Valuation\"). While dressbarn does not have goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets and the fair values of ANN, Lane Bryant, and Justice were all significantly in excess of their respective book values, the fair values of the maurices and Catherines reporting units exceeded their book values by less than 15% and are discussed below. In addition, while the fair value of most of our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their respective book values, the fair values of the LOFT and maurices trade names exceeded their respective book value by approximately 15% or less.\nmaurices and Catherines Fair Values\nThe Fiscal 2018 Valuation indicated maurices fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14% and that the Catherines fair value approximated its carrying value. As of August 4, 2018, maurices and Catherines had a goodwill balance of $93.5 million and $49.3 million, respectively.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included: a weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") of 14.0% for both maurices and Catherines, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks; operating income margin of mid-to-high single digits and a terminal growth rate of 2%. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $24 million at maurices and $5 million at Catherines. A hypothetical 1% change in the operating income percentages in all periods would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $58 million at maurices and $17 million at Catherines. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the terminal growth rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $15 million at maurices and $3 million at Catherines.\nLOFT and maurices Trade Names\nThe Fiscal 2018 Valuation indicated the fair value of our LOFT and maurices trade names exceeded their carrying value by approximately 15% and 11%, respectively. As of August 4, 2018, LOFT and maurices had trade name balances of $200.0 million and $89.0 million, respectively.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included the WACC and the royalty rate. The WACC selected was 14.5% for both trade names, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks. The royalty rate for the LOFT trade name was 2.0% and for the maurices trade name was 1.5%. The royalty rate selection was based on consideration of rates paid within third-party licensing transactions involving similar assets as well as an analysis of the profit margins expected to be generated by each brand. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $20 million at LOFT and $10 million at maurices. A hypothetical 0.5% change in the royalty rate would change the fair value by approximately $60 million at LOFT and $30 million at maurices.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nGeneral\nIt is possible that a shortfall in the cash flows from the amounts estimated in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation may result in a future impairment loss. As discussed earlier in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview, our brick and mortar store traffic remained a headwind for most of Fiscal 2018 and competition for consumer spending remains strong. As a result, we expect a highly promotional operating environment to continue into Fiscal 2019. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, industry and market trends and entity-specific risks and evaluate their impact on the valuation of our reporting units. For example, if we continue to experience sustained periods of declines or shifts in consumer spending, or fail to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Change for Growth Program, it could adversely impact the long-term assumptions used in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation. Such trends may also have a negative impact on other key assumptions used in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation, including anticipated gross margin and operating income margin, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate. These assumptions are highly judgmental and subject to change. We will conduct the 2019 assessment of goodwill and intangible assets as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, unless other indicators warrant an interim assessment.\nShould declines in our performance occur, or if our expectations regarding future performance decline, these conditions could adversely impact the valuation of our goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, particularly at the maurices and Catherines reporting units and the LOFT and maurices trade names, but also at our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets that exceeded or substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and we may be required to undertake impairment testing earlier than the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019. These declines could also adversely impact our other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Such changes, if material, may require us to incur additional material impairment charges for such goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, and may also require us to write-off all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in future periods.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of, and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $34.0 million, $21.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived tangible assets to their estimated fair value. Additionally, we incurred incremental store impairment charges of $15.2 million and $14.0 million in Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with the Change for Growth program, which are included within Restructuring and other related charges. There have been no impairment losses recorded on our finite-lived intangible assets for any of the periods presented. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on impairments of long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year, and include the results of any differences between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carry forwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. We account for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nValuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This determination requires significant judgment by management. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed quarterly and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. If we continue to experience sustained periods of unexpected declines in consumer spending, or fail to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Change for Growth Program, it could adversely impact our assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets. Such changes, if material, may require us to write-off all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in future periods.\nWe also establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we consider that a tax position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of limitation expires or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.\nIn December 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Act\") was signed into law. The 2017 Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that began to affect us in Fiscal 2018 and beyond. We are still in the process of determining the full impact of the 2017 Act; however, based on our current interpretation of the 2017 Act, we made reasonable estimates to record provisional amounts during Fiscal 2018. In that regard, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the 2017 Act enactment date of December 22, 2017 for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d (\"ASC 740\"). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the 2017 Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act is incomplete, but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 Act. The determinations made in applying the 2017 Act require significant judgment by management. We will continue to refine our estimates within the measurement period allowed, which will be completed no later than the second quarter of Fiscal 2019. See Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our financial statements in future reporting periods.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We and our subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the Company,\u201d ascena,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and ourselves,\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise.\nObjectives and Initiatives\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels and patterns of consumer spending. Some of the factors that could negatively impact discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, reductions in net worth, higher energy and other prices, increasing interest rates and low consumer confidence.\nRetailers, particularly those in the specialty apparel sector, continue to face intense competition and channel disruption as consumer spending habits continue to indicate an increasing preference to purchase digitally as opposed to in traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. While our comparative sales performance improved in the latter half of Fiscal 2018, competition for consumer spending remains strong and we expect a highly competitive operating environment to continue into Fiscal 2019. In response to this expected operating environment, we continue to scale back overall spending levels where possible, refine our operating model and implement new capabilities to ensure we remain competitive in this rapidly evolving sector. The more significant of these initiatives are described below.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nChange for Growth Program\nOver the last two fiscal years, we have undergone a substantial transformation program with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing shareholder value (the \"Change for Growth\" program). In connection with the program, we (i) implemented a number of initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, (ii) conducted a review of our store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of marginally profitable stores through either rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store footprint and convert sales from these stores into direct channel sales or to nearby store locations, (iii) began to develop new capabilities such as markdown optimization, size pack optimization and localized inventory planning, and (iv) enhanced our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions. Charges incurred as a result of these actions are described within the section Results of Operations.\nWe realized approximately $135 million in cost savings in Fiscal 2018, including $105 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), $15 million in Buying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\"), and $15 million in Cost of goods sold, related to Change for Growth program activity. We expect to realize approximately $100 to $125 million in incremental cost savings through Fiscal 2020, bringing the total expected cost savings from these activities, when combined with the $65 million cost savings achieved during Fiscal 2017, to approximately $300 to $325 million. These cost savings are achieved through (i) operating expense reductions in the areas of professional services, travel and facilities management, among others, (ii) refinement of our operating model to eliminate duplicative overhead, and increase utilization of our brand services functions, (iii) creating a platform that reduces product costs and improves information technology efficiencies and (iv) reduced rent expense resulting from store closures or negotiated rent reductions. These cost savings are expected to be realized in our segment operating results generally in proportion to their sales, and serve to offset ongoing inflationary pressure and required reinvestment to support key incremental business initiatives.\nWe may incur significant additional charges and capital expenditures in future periods as we continue our efforts under the Change for Growth program, which include completing actions already started, more fully define related Change for Growth program initiatives and moving into the execution phases of those associated projects. Since the scope of such efforts are not fully known at this time, the benefits of such initiatives, and any related charges or capital expenditures, are not currently quantifiable. Actions associated with the Change for Growth program are currently expected to continue through Fiscal 2019.\nIntegration of ANN\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we substantially completed our integration of ANN INC. (\"ANN\" or the \"ANN integration\") into our existing operations and realized cost savings of approximately $45 million during Fiscal 2018, with approximately $25 million related to our ongoing Cost of goods sold initiative at our Premium Fashion segment and approximately $20 million in SG&A synergies primarily related to non-merchandise procurement savings. We expect to realize additional synergies related to the integration of approximately $30 million, which are expected to be substantially realized in Fiscal 2019. Once completed, we continue to expect that the total synergies and cost savings related to the ANN integration, including amounts achieved from Fiscal 2016 through Fiscal 2019, will be approximately $235 million.\nDistribution and Fulfillment\nOver the last few years, (i) our brands' distribution and fulfillment capability was centralized into our brick-and-mortar store distribution facility in Etna, Ohio and our direct channel fulfillment facility in Greencastle, Indiana which has resulted in increased processing efficiencies, and (ii) we entered into a lease agreement for a distribution center in Riverside, California to serve as the receiving and west coast distribution hub for merchandise sourced from Asia. During Fiscal 2018, we completed the expansion of our Riverside facility to include both brick-and-mortar and direct channel distribution, and we introduced direct fulfillment capability at our Etna facility to further increase our capacity in this growing channel. We continue to explore ways to optimize and leverage our integrated distribution network, which may include providing such services to third parties.\nSourcing\nOur brands source their products through a variety of sourcing channels including internally through our ascena Global Sourcing (\"aGS\") subsidiary and externally through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends. We continue to increase the penetration of internally sourced products and manage our relationships with third-party buying agents.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOmni-channel Expansion\nWe continue to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel strategies. During Fiscal 2018, we also expanded the functionality of our Riverside, California distribution center and it now supports both our brick-and-mortar and direct channel operations. During Fiscal 2018, we continued to develop technology solutions which will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur individual segments are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back-to-school shopping periods. In particular, sales at our Kids Fashion segment tend to be significantly higher during the fall season, which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, as this includes the back-to-school period and the December holiday season. Our Plus Fashion segment tends to experience higher sales during the spring season, which include the Easter and Mother's Day holidays. Our Premium Fashion and Value Fashion segments have relatively balanced sales across the Fall and Spring seasons. As a result, our operational results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFiscal Period\nAs disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we recognized an additional week during Fiscal 2018 as we conformed our fiscal calendar to that of the National Retail Federation.\nPerformance of the Value Fashion segment\nDuring Fiscal 2018, in connection with the Company's ongoing review of the Value Fashion segment, the Company made certain senior management changes in the segment with a view towards improving its performance. This review resulted in additional clearance markdowns to improve inventory composition as of the end of Fiscal 2018, as well as impairment charges related to certain under-performing retail store assets. The Company plans to continue to pursue initiatives to improve the segment's performance and to optimize shareholder value.\nImpact of Hurricanes\nDuring the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, our business was impacted by three hurricanes that disrupted normal operations at approximately 600 of our retail stores in the south-central and southeast areas of the United States, as well as Puerto Rico. These stores were impacted by the hurricanes, either as a result of damage incurred or declines in customer traffic. Almost all of the stores damaged in the hurricanes have resumed operations. We have substantially completed our assessment of the damages associated with these events and estimate that our results were negatively impacted by approximately $11 million of sales losses, a portion of which may be recovered through business interruption insurance claims. As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we have received approximately $2 million in recoveries from these insurance claims. Other than the impact of the sales losses, the hurricanes did not have a material impact on our business or results from operations.\nSummary and Key Developments\nOur Fiscal 2018 operating results were impacted by a decline in store traffic and a more promotional selling environment, along with under-performance at the dressbarn brand which led to non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets and incremental markdowns to sell through excess inventory. These items were partially mitigated by improved operating results in our Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion segments, costs and savings related to our Change for Growth program and costs and synergies from the continued integration of our Premium Fashion segment, which was acquired in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOperating highlights for Fiscal 2018 are as follows:\n \u2022 Comparable sales decreased by 2%, reflecting declines at our Premium Fashion, Value Fashion and Plus Fashion segments offset in part by an increase at our Kids Fashion segment; \n \u2022 Gross margin rate decreased by 40 basis points to 57.6% primarily reflecting incremental shipping costs of approximately $43 million across the segments as a result of increased mix of direct channel sales, and a 280 basis point decline at our dressbarn brand; \n \u2022 SG&A expenses decreased by 1.5% and included $34.0 million of non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets, primarily at our dressbarn brand; \n \u2022 Operating income increased to $34.3 million compared to an operating loss of $1,313.8 million for the year-ago period, with the improvement primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the year-ago period; and \n \u2022 Net loss per diluted share of $0.20 in Fiscal 2018, compared to net loss per diluted share of $5.48 for Fiscal 2017. \nLiquidity for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 Net cash from operations was $273.9 million, compared to $343.6 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in prepaid rent of approximately $50 million due to timing of payments; \n \u2022 Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $134.4 million, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $186.3 million offset in part by proceeds from the sale of assets, compared to $268.9 million in the year-ago period, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $258.1 million; and \n \u2022 Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $226.2 million, consisting primarily of term loan repayments of $225.0 million, compared to $120.9 million in the year-ago period, consisting primarily of term loan repayments of $122.5 million. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Net sales decreased by $71.5 million, or 1.1%, to $6,578.3 million in Fiscal 2018 from $6,649.8 million in the year-ago period. The decline in net sales primarily reflected a 2% decline in comparable sales that mainly resulted from a 6.7% decline in net sales at our Value Fashion segment, as well as product assortment challenges during the first half of Fiscal 2018 experienced by the Premium Fashion segment, which returned to positive comp performance in the second half of Fiscal 2018. Non-comparable sales declined by $73.0 million, or 37.1%, to $123.6 million from $196.6 million, as discussed on a segment basis below. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues increased by $5.2 million, or 2.5%, to $212.8 million from $207.6 million. Net sales for all four segments also included incremental revenues of $113.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 as previously discussed.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales data for our four operating segments is presented below.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,317.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,322.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,820.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,340.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kids Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,023.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,578.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,649.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(71.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable sales (a)(b)(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and direct channel sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in stores only open in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Direct channel sales refer to growth of sales from our direct channel in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year. Due to customer cross-channel behavior, we report a single, consolidated comparable sales metric, inclusive of store and direct channels.\n(b) Incremental revenues of approximately $113.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 are excluded from the calculation of comparable sales.\n (c) During Fiscal 2018, vouchers distributed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 in connection with the Justice pricing litigation, discussed more fully in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, began to be redeemed. Comparable sales related to these transactions includes the transaction value in excess of the voucher value. \nPremium Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 5% comparable sales decline of $37.3 million at Ann Taylor, and a less than 1% comparable sales decline of $7.3 million at LOFT; \n \u2022 a $4.9 million increase in non-comparable sales primarily reflecting a net positive impact at LOFT, as the impact of 8 store openings more than offset the impact of 14 store closures, which was offset in part by the negative impact of 18 net store closures at Ann Taylor; \n \u2022 a $24.6 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $10.3 million increase in other revenues primarily related to higher gift card breakage and higher credit revenue. \nValue Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 10% comparable sales decline of $86.8 million at dressbarn and a 4% comparable sales decline of $35.2 million at maurices; \n \u2022 a $38.2 million decline in non-comparable sales substantially all at dressbarn reflecting 49 store closures; \n \u2022 a $32.6 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $2.1 million decline in other revenues. \nPlus Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 1% comparable sales decline of $7.9 million at Lane Bryant and a 3% comparable sales decline of $9.6 million at Catherines; \n \u2022 an $11.0 million decline in non-comparable sales at Lane Bryant due to 15 net store closures and a $7.0 million decline in non-comparable sales at Catherines due to 11 net store closures; \n \u2022 a $20.7 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $0.9 million increase in other revenues. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nKids Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 7% comparable sales increase of $67.4 million at Justice; \n \u2022 a $21.7 million decline in non-comparable sales primarily due to 53 net store closures; \n \u2022 a $35.1 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $3.9 million decline in other revenues primarily due to lower wholesale revenue. \nGross margin. Gross margin, in terms of dollars decreased as a result of the decline in comparable sales as well as a decline in gross margin rate. Gross margin rate, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in Fiscal 2018 from 58.0% in Fiscal 2017. Improved performance at our Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion segments was offset by declines at our Premium Fashion and Value Fashion segments. On a consolidated basis, gross margin reflects higher shipping costs of approximately $43 million across the segments as a result of an increased mix of direct channel sales and higher air freight costs, offset by the realization of approximately $40 million in synergies and cost savings benefits achieved from product sourcing and transportation costs.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period.\nGross margin rate highlights on a segment basis are as follows:\n \u2022 Premium Fashion gross margin rate performance declined by approximately 60 basis points, reflecting higher shipping costs related to increased direct channel penetration and an increased level of promotional selling resulting from soft product acceptance during the first half of Fiscal 2018, offset in part by the segment's cost of goods sold initiative. \n \u2022 Value Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 150 basis, points caused primarily by a 280 basis point decline at dressbarn. The decline mainly reflects higher markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels, a higher level of promotional selling, particularly at dressbarn, due to lower than expected customer demand, and higher shipping costs related to the increased direct channel penetration. \n \u2022 Plus Fashion gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 30 basis points, reflecting improved product acceptance and lower levels of promotional selling, offset in part by higher shipping costs related to the increased direct channel penetration. \n \u2022 Kids Fashion gross margin rate performance improved approximately 90 basis points, resulting from improved product acceptance, offset in part by incremental freight expenses necessary to meet higher product demand. \nBuying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\") expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses increased by $6.8 million, or 0.5%, to $1,281.1 million in Fiscal 2018 from $1,274.3 million in Fiscal 2017. Higher buying costs and variable distribution costs related to the increased penetration of our direct channel business were partly offset by lower occupancy expenses related to our fleet optimization program, which provided approximately $15 million of cost savings during Fiscal 2018. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 30 basis points to 19.5% in Fiscal 2018 from 19.2% in Fiscal 2017, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $31.8 million, or 1.5%, to $2,036.7 million in Fiscal 2018 from $2,068.5 million in Fiscal 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to approximately $125 million in synergies and cost reduction initiatives, mainly reflecting headcount and non-merchandise procurement savings. Also contributing to the decrease were lower store expenses, resulting from the fleet optimization program, and lower performance-based compensation. These items were offset in part by inflationary increases, higher write-downs of store related fixed assets, primarily at the Value Fashion segment, and the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 recorded for all of the segments. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nby 10 basis points to 31.0% in Fiscal 2018 from 31.1% in Fiscal 2017, and reflects the impact of the reduced expenses, offset in part by the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $29.4 million, or 7.6%, to $355.5 million in Fiscal 2018 from $384.9 million in Fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in store count resulting from our fleet optimization program, offset in part by incremental depreciation from capital investments.\nOperating income (loss). Operating income was $34.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared to an operating loss of $1,313.8 million in Fiscal 2017 and is discussed on a segment basis below.\nOperating results for our four operating segments are presented below.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kids Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated acquisition and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(596.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>596.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(728.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,313.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,348.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nPremium Fashion operating income decreased by $5.7 million primarily due to lower comparable sales and gross margin rate as discussed above, offset in part by a decrease in SG&A expenses. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation, and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nValue Fashion operating results decreased by $95.4 million primarily due to lower comparable sales and gross margin rate, as discussed above, and an increase in SG&A expenses, which were offset in part by lower BD&O expenses. The lower BD&O expenses primarily reflect lower occupancy expenses associated with our fleet optimization program. The higher SG&A expenses primarily reflect higher non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets as previously discussed, offset in part by a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nPlus Fashion operating income increased by $11.6 million primarily due to an increase in the gross margin rate, as discussed above, and a decrease in SG&A expenses, which were offset in part by higher BD&O expenses and a decrease in comparable sales, also discussed above. The higher BD&O expenses primarily reflect the increased penetration of our direct channel business. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by a decrease in administrative payroll costs, lower marketing expenses, and other cost savings initiatives, mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nKids Fashion operating income increased by $75.8 million primarily due to an increase in comparable sales and gross margin rate, as discussed above, as well as lower SG&A expenses. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by lower store expenses associated with our fleet optimization program, lower marketing expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nUnallocated acquisition and integration expenses of $5.4 million for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's distribution operations, including the closure of the former ANN distribution facility in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the gain on the related sale of that facility, which occurred in Fiscal 2018. The $39.4 million of unallocated acquisition and integration expenses in Fiscal 2017 represents costs related to the ANN Acquisition consisting of $14.3\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nmillion of severance and retention costs, $8.0 million of settlement charges and professional fees related to the termination of the pension plan acquired in the ANN Acquisition, and $17.1 million of other costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's operations.\nUnallocated restructuring and other related charges reflects costs incurred under the Change for Growth program. Expenses of $78.5 million for Fiscal 2018 included $59.2 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of transformation initiatives, $5.2 million of severance and other related expenses, and asset impairments of $14.1 million reflecting decisions within the fleet optimization program to close certain under-performing stores as well as a write-down of a building. The $81.9 million of unallocated restructuring and other related charges in Fiscal 2017 represents $33.2 million of severance and other related expenses, $15.3 million for charges related to fleet optimization program and $33.4 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of transformation initiatives.\nUnallocated impairment of goodwill reflects the Fiscal 2017 write-down of the carrying values of the reporting units to their fair values and is included in our operating segments as follows: $428.9 million at our Premium Fashion segment, $107.2 million at our Value Fashion segment and $60.2 million at our Plus Fashion segment. There was no unallocated impairment of goodwill in Fiscal 2018.\nUnallocated impairment of intangible assets reflects the Fiscal 2017 write-down of our trade name intangible assets to their fair values as follows: $210.0 million of our Ann Taylor trade name, $356.3 million of our LOFT trade name and $161.8 million of our Lane Bryant trade name. There was no unallocated impairment of intangible assets in Fiscal 2018.\nInterest expense increased by $10.8 million to $113.0 million for Fiscal 2018 from $102.2 million in Fiscal 2017, primarily caused by a higher interest rate on our term loan.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. During Fiscal 2018, the company made repayments of $180.0 million which were applied towards future scheduled quarterly payments of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan debt, resulting in a $5.0 million pre-tax loss reflecting the acceleration of deferred financing fees.\nBenefit for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. We recorded a benefit of $41.8 million in Fiscal 2018 on a pre-tax loss of $81.5 million, for an effective tax rate of 51.3%, which reflects the provisional impact of recording the tax effects associated with the 2017 Act discussed in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. This was offset by the impact of recording a valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets also discussed in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accounting for the tax effects of share-based compensation discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In Fiscal 2017, we recorded a benefit of $346.9 million on a pre-tax loss of $1,414.2 million for a 24.5% effective tax rate. The effective annual tax rate for Fiscal 2017 is lower than the statutory federal and state tax rate primarily as $526.5 million of the impairment of goodwill is non-deductible for income tax purposes and is treated as a permanent difference.\nNet loss decreased to $39.7 million in Fiscal 2018 from $1,067.3 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, net of the related income tax benefit, recorded in the year-ago period as discussed above.\nNet loss per diluted common share was to $0.20 per share in Fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of $5.48

Net sales decreased by $345.6 million, or 4.9%, to $6,649.8 million in Fiscal 2017 from $6,995.4 million in Fiscal 2016. The decline in net sales primarily reflected a 5% decline in comparable sales which was offset in part by three additional weeks of net sales for the Premium Fashion segment in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 which included only the 49-week post-acquisition period. The comparable sales decline resulted from reduced store traffic. Non-comparable sales decreased by $23.5 million, or 14.0%, to $144.2 million from $167.7 million, as discussed on a segment basis below. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues increased by $8.8 million, or 6.1%, to $152.2 million from $143.4 million. Also contributing to the decline was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016, which represented an incremental $82 million in net sales in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales data for our four operating segments is presented below.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Premium Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,322.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,330.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Value Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,094.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Plus Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,463.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Kids Fashion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,023.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,649.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,995.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(345.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable sales (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and direct channel sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in stores only open in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Direct channel sales refer to growth of sales from our direct channel in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year. Due to customer cross-channel behavior, we report a single, consolidated comparable sales metric, inclusive of store and direct channels.\nPremium Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 52-week period compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a 7% comparable sales decline at Ann Taylor and a 4% comparable sales decline at LOFT; and \n \u2022 18 net store closures at Ann Taylor and 4 net store closures at LOFT. \nValue Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 9% comparable sales decline of $88.7 million at maurices and a 5% comparable sales decline of $46.6 million at dressbarn; \n \u2022 a $22.4 million increase in non-comparable sales due to 12 net store openings at maurices, offset in part by a $19.8 million decline in non-comparable sales due to 30 net store closures at dressbarn; \n \u2022 a $34.5 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $22.8 million increase in other revenues primarily due to the segment's new private label credit card program. \nPlus Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 7% comparable sales decline of $67.3 million at Lane Bryant and a 4% comparable sales decline of $11.3 million at Catherines; \n \u2022 a $2.3 million decline in non-comparable sales due to 8 net store closures at Lane Bryant and 14 net store closures at Catherines; \n \u2022 a $23.0 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $5.8 million decline in other revenues due to lower revenue from product sell-off and gift card breakage. \nKids Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 3% comparable sales decline of $26.3 million at Justice; \n \u2022 a $23.8 million decline in non-comparable sales caused by 37 net store closures; \n \u2022 a $24.9 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $8.2 million decline in other revenues due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nGross margin. Gross margin rate, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased by 180 basis points from 56.2% in Fiscal 2016 to 58.0% in Fiscal 2017. The increase was due to an approximate $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory to fair market value recorded during Fiscal 2016 in our Premium Fashion segment. Excluding the prior year impact of the inventory amortization, gross margin rate was essentially flat, as improved performance at our Premium Fashion and Plus Fashion segments was offset by declines at our Value Fashion and Kids Fashion segments. On a consolidated basis, gross margin benefited from the realization of approximately $55 million in combined integration synergies and cost savings related to our ongoing supply chain integration and the cost of goods sold initiatives at its Premium Fashion segment.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period.\nGross margin rate highlights on a segment basis are as follows:\n \u2022 Premium Fashion gross margin rate performance reflected an approximate $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory recorded during Fiscal 2016 discussed above. Excluding the prior year impact of the inventory amortization, gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 220 basis points, reflecting significant improvement at both Ann Taylor and LOFT. Both brands benefited from realization of freight cost synergies related to our ongoing supply chain integration and the segment's cost of goods sold initiative. \n \u2022 Value Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 110 basis points, resulting from a higher level of promotional selling across the segment and increased markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels on lower than expected customer demand. \n \u2022 Plus Fashion gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 120 basis points, mainly due to more effective inventory management at both Lane Bryant and Catherines. \n \u2022 Kids Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 370 basis points, resulting from a higher level of promotional selling and increased markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels on lower than expected customer demand. \nBuying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\") expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses decreased by $12.2 million, or 0.9%, to $1,274.3 million in Fiscal 2017 from $1,286.5 million in Fiscal 2016. BD&O expenses for the Premium Fashion segment increased by $14.7 million primarily as the results reflected a 52-week period in Fiscal 2017 compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016. For our other segments, BD&O expenses decreased by $26.9 million primarily due to lower occupancy expenses on a reduced store count and lower performance-based compensation. On a consolidated basis, BD&O expenses also included approximately $10 million in transformation initiatives and approximately $10 million of synergies related to the ANN Acquisition associated with the consolidation of the Premium Fashion segment brands into our ecommerce fulfillment center. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 80 basis points to 19.2% in Fiscal 2017 from 18.4% in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $43.8 million, or 2.1%, to $2,068.5 million in Fiscal 2017 from $2,112.3 million in Fiscal 2016. SG&A expenses for the Premium Fashion segment increased by $25.2 million primarily as the results reflected a 52-week period in Fiscal 2017 compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016. For our other segments, SG&A expenses decreased by $69.0 million primarily due to store closures and the lower sales volume, reduced marketing expenses, lower performance-based compensation and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program. On a consolidated basis, SG&A expenses also included approximately $85 million in synergies and transformation initiatives, primarily due to the elimination of redundant leadership and non-merchandise procurement savings. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nsales increased by 90 basis points to 31.1% in Fiscal 2017 from 30.2% in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $26.2 million, or 7.3%, to $384.9 million in Fiscal 2017 from $358.7 million in Fiscal 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense for the Premium Fashion segment increased by $6.2 million primarily as the results reflected a 52-week period in Fiscal 2017 compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016. For our other segments, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20.0 million primarily due to our direct channel platform investment which was placed in service in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 period and investments in our distribution network primarily to integrate the operations of ANN.\nOperating (loss) income. Operating loss was $1,313.8 million for Fiscal 2017 compared to operating income of $93.8 million for Fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as the decrease in operating results discussed on a segment basis below.

The operating results for Fiscal 2017 reflected an improvement in gross margin rate, partially offset by lower comparable sales, both discussed above. Operating expenses for Fiscal 2017 reflected lower performance-based compensation, synergies savings associated with the transition into our direct channel fulfillment center, lower occupancy expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program and integration-related activities.\nValue Fashion operating income decreased by $79.8 million as a result of the decreases in net sales and gross margin rate, both discussed above, as well as an increase in depreciation expense, offset in part by decreases in operating expenses. Operating expense reductions were driven by lower performance-based compensation, lower store variable expenses resulting from the decrease in sales volume and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nPlus Fashion operating income decreased by $21.4 million as a result of the decrease in net sales and an increase in depreciation expense. These items were offset in part by an improvement in gross margin rate and decreased operating expenses. Operating expense reductions were driven by lower occupancy expenses, reduced marketing expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nKids Fashion operating results decreased by $65.7 million as a result of the decreases in net sales and gross margin rate and the additional peak back-to-school week included in Fiscal 2016 as a result of the 53rd week, offset in part by a decrease in operating expenses. The impact of the additional peak back-to-school week in Fiscal 2016 was approximately $10 million. Operating expense reductions were driven by lower occupancy expenses, lower performance-based compensation and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nUnallocated acquisition and integration expenses of $39.4 million for Fiscal 2017 included $14.3 million of severance and retention costs, $8.0 million of settlement charges and professional fees related to the termination of the pension plan acquired in the ANN Acquisition, and $17.1 million of other costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's operations. The $77.4 million of unallocated acquisition and integration expenses in Fiscal 2016 represents costs related to the ANN Acquisition consisting of $20.8 million of legal, consulting and investment-banking related transaction costs, $37.5 million of severance and retention-related expenses and $17.3 million of integration costs primarily to combine the operations and infrastructure of the ANN business.\nUnallocated restructuring and other related charges of $81.9 million for Fiscal 2017 included $33.2 million of severance and other related expenses, $15.3 million for charges related to the fleet optimization program and $33.4 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of the transformation initiatives associated with the Change for Growth program. There was no unallocated restructuring and other related charges in Fiscal 2016.\nUnallocated impairment of goodwill of $596.3 million for Fiscal 2017 reflects the write-down of the carrying values of the reporting units to their fair values and is included in our operating segments as follows: $428.9 million at our Premium Fashion segment, $107.2 million at our Value Fashion segment and $60.2 million at our Plus Fashion segment. There was no unallocated impairment of goodwill in Fiscal 2016.\nUnallocated impairment of intangible assets of $728.1 million for Fiscal 2017 reflects the write down of our trade name intangible assets to their fair values as follows: $210.0 million of our Ann Taylor trade name, $356.3 million of our LOFT trade name and $161.8 million of our Lane Bryant trade name. There was no unallocated impairment of intangible assets in Fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense decreased by $1.1 million to $102.2 million for Fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of the principal redemptions and repayments of the term loan during Fiscal 2017, mostly offset by a higher interest rate and an additional three weeks of interest expense on the term loan for Fiscal 2017 due to the timing of the ANN Acquisition.\nGain on extinguishment of debt. During Fiscal 2016, we repurchased $72.0 million of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan debt at an aggregate cost of $68.4 million through open market transactions, resulting in a $0.8 million pre-tax gain, net of the proportional write-off of unamortized original issuance discount and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The benefit (provision) for income taxes increased by $350.5 million to a benefit of $346.9 million in Fiscal 2017 from a provision of $3.6 million in Fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was 24.5% for Fiscal 2017 and negative 43.4% for Fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate computing the benefit on the pre-tax loss for Fiscal 2017 is lower than the statutory federal and state tax rate primarily as $526.5 million of the goodwill impairment charge is non-deductible for income tax purposes and is treated as a permanent difference. The negative effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 despite a net loss was primarily due to state and local taxes and certain expenses which were non-deductible for income tax purposes.\nNet loss increased by $1,055.4 million to $1,067.3 million in Fiscal 2017 from $11.9 million in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as lower operating results discussed above.\nNet loss per diluted common share increased by $5.42 to $5.48 per share in Fiscal 2017 from $0.06 per share in Fiscal 2016 due to the higher net loss discussed above.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years presented as follows:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(268.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $273.9 million for Fiscal 2018, compared with $343.6 million during the year-ago period. Cash provided by operations was lower during Fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower net income before non-cash expenses and higher working capital outflows in Fiscal 2018, primarily related to timing of payments for store rent expense of approximately $50 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $134.4 million, compared with $268.9 million for the year-ago period. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $186.3 million, offset in part by $52.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, which substantially reflects the redemption of cash surrender value on certain company-owned life insurance policies. Net cash used in investing activities in the year-ago period was $268.9 million, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $258.1 million and the purchase of an intangible asset of $11.6 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $226.2 million during Fiscal 2018, consisting primarily of $225.0 million of principal repayments of our term loan debt.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $343.6 million for Fiscal 2017, compared with $445.4 million during Fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operations was lower during Fiscal 2017 as lower net income and unfavorable working capital outflows related to timing of payments and lower incentive compensation accruals were offset in part by cash used for non-recurring payments made during Fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting an escrow payment of approximately $51 million for the Justice pricing litigation settlement and a payment of approximately $44 million to a former Justice executive.\nNet cash used in investing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $1,494.6 million of cash paid in the ANN Acquisition and cash used for capital expenditures of $366.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments of $25.4 million.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $120.9 million during Fiscal 2017, consisting primarily of principal repayments of our term loan debt. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,521.5 million during Fiscal 2016, consisting primarily of $1,764.0 million of borrowing under our new term loan, offset in part by net repayments of debt under our amended revolving credit agreement of $116.0 million, $77.4 million of redemptions and principal repayments of our term loan debt and $42.6 million of payments made for deferred financing costs related to the new borrowing arrangements entered into during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nCapital Spending\nIn Fiscal 2018, we had $186.3 million in capital expenditures, which included spending for non-routine capital investments including our omni-channel platform and initiatives identified with the Change for Growth program, as well as routine spending in connection with our digital initiatives, infrastructure, and our retail store network. The most significant non-routine initiatives are described below.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we continued to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel capability. We completed the expansion of our Riverside, California facility to include the direct channel, as well as brick-and-mortar distribution. Additionally, during Fiscal 2018, we continued to develop technology solutions which will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support more effective product and marketing decisions. Also, in connection with the Change for Growth program, we spent approximately $40 million in Fiscal 2018 and expect to spend approximately $30 million in Fiscal 2019 on projects to improve operational efficiency and enhance our customer-facing capabilities.\nWe expect that total capital spending for Fiscal 2019, including (i) routine spending, (ii) technological spending for the projects discussed above, and (iii) spending required to support the Change for Growth program, will be in the range of $180-$210 million. Our routine and non-routine capital requirements are expected to be funded primarily with available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and, to the extent necessary, borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement which is defined and discussed below.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from our operations, remaining availability under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement after taking into account outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and the collateral limitation, and available cash and cash equivalents. These sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, retail store expansion, construction and renovation of stores, investment in technological and supply chain infrastructure, acquisitions, debt servicing requirements, stock repurchases, dividends, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our operating needs, capital requirements and any debt service requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAs of August 4, 2018, approximately $44 million, or 18%, of our available cash and cash equivalents was held overseas by our foreign subsidiaries, which represents a significant reduction in our offshore cash balance from Fiscal 2017. The 2017 Act eliminated the deferral of the U.S. tax liability on offshore earnings and profits, and subjected those earnings to tax under the Transition Tax rules that were part of the 2017 Act. The assessment of the Transition Tax meant that our offshore cash and offshore earnings could be repatriated at minimal tax cost. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we repatriated approximately $273 million of our foreign cash back to the U.S. Any remaining offshore cash balances are required to meet the working capital needs of the Company's offshore businesses or are subject to foreign exchange control regulations. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for our remaining foreign held cash balances and will repatriate any excess cash balances as necessary.\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had $472.9 million of availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nDebt\nFor a detailed description of the terms and restrictions under our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated February 27, 2018 (the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\") and the $1.8 billion seven-year term loan (the \"Term Loan\"), see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAmended Revolving Credit Agreement\nWe believe that our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. We were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement as of August 4, 2018. The Amended Revolving Credit Agreement extends the maturity of the Company's revolving credit facility from August 2020 to the earlier of (i) 5 years from the closing date (or February 2023) or (ii) 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Term Loans (unless (a) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans is $150 million or less and (b) the Company maintains liquidity (which can include (1) availability under the credit facility in excess of the greater of $100 million and 20% of the credit limit and (2) cash held in a controlled account of the administrative agent of the revolving credit facility) in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the remaining Term Loans, as described in more detail in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to continue to support our operating needs and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nTerm Loan\nFor Fiscal 2018, we repaid a total of $225.0 million term loan debt of which $180.0 million was applied to future quarterly scheduled payments such that we are not required to make a quarterly payment until November of Fiscal 2021. We may from time to time seek to repay or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt arrangements, among other factors.\nAdditionally, we expect to incur cash interest expense of approximately $91 million on the Term Loan in Fiscal 2019 based on the outstanding balance and interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018. Such interest and principal payments are expected to be funded with our cash flows from operations.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThere were no purchases of common stock during Fiscal 2018 under the repurchase program. For a complete description of our 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe may from time to time continue to repurchase additional shares depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt agreements, among other factors.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of August 4, 2018, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

Interest payments on our Term Loan were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018 and the estimated outstanding balance, giving effect to the contractual repayments in future periods. Interest payments on our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, if any, were calculated based on the outstanding balance and the interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018, as if the borrowings remain outstanding until repayment is required at expiration in February 2023. \n \u2022 Operating lease obligations represent the estimated minimum lease rental payments for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world and do not include incremental rentals based on a percentage of sales. Although such amounts are generally non-cancelable, certain leases are cancelable if specified sales levels are not achieved or co-tenancy requirements are not being satisfied. All future minimum rentals under these cancelable leases have been included in the above table. In addition to such amounts, we are normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to the leased real estate properties, which are not included in the table above. \n \u2022 Inventory purchase commitments represent our agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices. While a portion of these commitments may be canceled at our option up to 30 days prior to the vendor's scheduled shipment date, such commitments are generally not canceled and are included in the table above. \n \u2022 Other commitments primarily represent contractual payments related to information technology services. While these commitments may be canceled at our option for a termination fee, such commitments are generally not canceled and are included in the table above. \nExcluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $69.4 million as of August 4, 2018. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the above table because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.\nThe above table also excludes the following: (i) non-debt related amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 4, 2018, as these items will be paid within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nassociated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a \"purchase obligation\" as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items).\nWe also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Notes 15 and 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table, including obligations under employment agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit amounted to approximately $27.1 million as of August 4, 2018. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe are exposed to a variety of market-based risks, representing our potential exposure to losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. These market risks include, but are not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our Canadian operations, changes in interest rates, and changes in both the value and liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, in the normal course of business, we employ a number of established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including considering, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks. However, as a matter of policy, we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we did not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe currently do not have any significant risks related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Purchases of inventory for resale in our retail stores and direct channel operations normally are transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, our 100% owned international retail operations represent approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. In the future, if our international operations continue to expand, we may consider the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage any significant risks to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had $1,371.5 million in variable-rate debt outstanding under our borrowing agreements. Accordingly, we remain subject to changes in interest rates. For each 0.125% increase or decrease in interest rates, our interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $1.7 million, and net income would decrease or increase, respectively, by approximately $1.3 million. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms and conditions of our borrowing agreements.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $238.9 million. We maintain cash deposits and cash equivalents with well-known and stable financial institutions; however, there were significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at overseas financial institutions as well as FDIC-insured financial institutions that were in excess of FDIC-insured limits at the end of Fiscal 2018. This represents a concentration of credit risk. While there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date, we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe SEC's Financial Reporting Release No. 60, \"Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies\" (\"FRR 60\"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our operational results and financial position and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents the critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nRetail Inventory Method\nWe hold inventory for sale through our retail stores and direct channel sites. All of our segments, other than Premium Fashion discussed below, use the retail inventory method of accounting, under which inventory is stated at the lower of cost, on a First In, First Out ( FIFO\u201d) basis, or market. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. Inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including, among others, initial merchandise markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.\nWe continuously review the inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and markdowns necessary to clear slow-moving merchandise, which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value. Consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns, aging of inventories, historical sales trends, and the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, as well as changes in consumer preferences, market and economic conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs and the markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results.\nWeighted-average Cost Method\nThe Premium Fashion segment uses the weighted-average cost method to value inventory, under which inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market, at the individual item level. Inventory cost is adjusted when the current selling price or future estimated selling price is less than cost.\nReserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nTo assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, we review and consider an appraisal from an independent valuation firm. Estimates of fair value are determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and the timing of those cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. Estimating the fair value is judgmental in nature, which could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe fair values of the reporting units are determined using a combination of the income approach (the discounted cash flows method) and the market approach (guideline public company method and guideline transaction method). We believe that the income approach is the most reliable indication of value as it captures forecasted revenues and earnings for the reporting units in the projection period that the market approach may not directly incorporate. Therefore, a greater weighting was applied to the income approach than the market approach.\nThe assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting units identified for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment for all periods presented are ANN, Justice, Lane Bryant, maurices, dressbarn and Catherines, each of which represents the lowest level where discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment managers.\nFiscal 2018 Impairment Assessment\nIn the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we performed our annual impairment assessment (the \"Fiscal 2018 Valuation\"). While dressbarn does not have goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets and the fair values of ANN, Lane Bryant, and Justice were all significantly in excess of their respective book values, the fair values of the maurices and Catherines reporting units exceeded their book values by less than 15% and are discussed below. In addition, while the fair value of most of our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their respective book values, the fair values of the LOFT and maurices trade names exceeded their respective book value by approximately 15% or less.\nmaurices and Catherines Fair Values\nThe Fiscal 2018 Valuation indicated maurices fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14% and that the Catherines fair value approximated its carrying value. As of August 4, 2018, maurices and Catherines had a goodwill balance of $93.5 million and $49.3 million, respectively.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included: a weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") of 14.0% for both maurices and Catherines, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks; operating income margin of mid-to-high single digits and a terminal growth rate of 2%. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $24 million at maurices and $5 million at Catherines. A hypothetical 1% change in the operating income percentages in all periods would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $58 million at maurices and $17 million at Catherines. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the terminal growth rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $15 million at maurices and $3 million at Catherines.\nLOFT and maurices Trade Names\nThe Fiscal 2018 Valuation indicated the fair value of our LOFT and maurices trade names exceeded their carrying value by approximately 15% and 11%, respectively. As of August 4, 2018, LOFT and maurices had trade name balances of $200.0 million and $89.0 million, respectively.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included the WACC and the royalty rate. The WACC selected was 14.5% for both trade names, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks. The royalty rate for the LOFT trade name was 2.0% and for the maurices trade name was 1.5%. The royalty rate selection was based on consideration of rates paid within third-party licensing transactions involving similar assets as well as an analysis of the profit margins expected to be generated by each brand. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $20 million at LOFT and $10 million at maurices. A hypothetical 0.5% change in the royalty rate would change the fair value by approximately $60 million at LOFT and $30 million at maurices.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nGeneral\nIt is possible that a shortfall in the cash flows from the amounts estimated in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation may result in a future impairment loss. As discussed earlier in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview, our brick and mortar store traffic remained a headwind for most of Fiscal 2018 and competition for consumer spending remains strong. As a result, we expect a highly promotional operating environment to continue into Fiscal 2019. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, industry and market trends and entity-specific risks and evaluate their impact on the valuation of our reporting units. For example, if we continue to experience sustained periods of declines or shifts in consumer spending, or fail to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Change for Growth Program, it could adversely impact the long-term assumptions used in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation. Such trends may also have a negative impact on other key assumptions used in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation, including anticipated gross margin and operating income margin, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate. These assumptions are highly judgmental and subject to change. We will conduct the 2019 assessment of goodwill and intangible assets as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, unless other indicators warrant an interim assessment.\nShould declines in our performance occur, or if our expectations regarding future performance decline, these conditions could adversely impact the valuation of our goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, particularly at the maurices and Catherines reporting units and the LOFT and maurices trade names, but also at our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets that exceeded or substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and we may be required to undertake impairment testing earlier than the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019. These declines could also adversely impact our other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Such changes, if material, may require us to incur additional material impairment charges for such goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, and may also require us to write-off all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in future periods.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of, and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $34.0 million, $21.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived tangible assets to their estimated fair value. Additionally, we incurred incremental store impairment charges of $15.2 million and $14.0 million in Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with the Change for Growth program, which are included within Restructuring and other related charges. There have been no impairment losses recorded on our finite-lived intangible assets for any of the periods presented. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on impairments of long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year, and include the results of any differences between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carry forwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. We account for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nValuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This determination requires significant judgment by management. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed quarterly and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. If we continue to experience sustained periods of unexpected declines in consumer spending, or fail to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Change for Growth Program, it could adversely impact our assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets. Such changes, if material, may require us to write-off all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in future periods.\nWe also establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we consider that a tax position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of limitation expires or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.\nIn December 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Act\") was signed into law. The 2017 Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that began to affect us in Fiscal 2018 and beyond. We are still in the process of determining the full impact of the 2017 Act; however, based on our current interpretation of the 2017 Act, we made reasonable estimates to record provisional amounts during Fiscal 2018. In that regard, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the 2017 Act enactment date of December 22, 2017 for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d (\"ASC 740\"). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the 2017 Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act is incomplete, but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 Act. The determinations made in applying the 2017 Act require significant judgment by management. We will continue to refine our estimates within the measurement period allowed, which will be completed no later than the second quarter of Fiscal 2019. See Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our financial statements in future reporting periods.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

We and our subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the Company,\u201d ascena,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and ourselves,\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise.\nObjectives and Initiatives\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels and patterns of consumer spending. Some of the factors that could negatively impact discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, reductions in net worth, higher energy and other prices, increasing interest rates and low consumer confidence.\nRetailers, particularly those in the specialty apparel sector, continue to face intense competition and channel disruption as consumer spending habits continue to indicate an increasing preference to purchase digitally as opposed to in traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. While our comparative sales performance improved in the latter half of Fiscal 2018, competition for consumer spending remains strong and we expect a highly competitive operating environment to continue into Fiscal 2019. In response to this expected operating environment, we continue to scale back overall spending levels where possible, refine our operating model and implement new capabilities to ensure we remain competitive in this rapidly evolving sector. The more significant of these initiatives are described below.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nChange for Growth Program\nOver the last two fiscal years, we have undergone a substantial transformation program with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing shareholder value (the \"Change for Growth\" program). In connection with the program, we (i) implemented a number of initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, (ii) conducted a review of our store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of marginally profitable stores through either rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store footprint and convert sales from these stores into direct channel sales or to nearby store locations, (iii) began to develop new capabilities such as markdown optimization, size pack optimization and localized inventory planning, and (iv) enhanced our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions. Charges incurred as a result of these actions are described within the section Results of Operations.\nWe realized approximately $135 million in cost savings in Fiscal 2018, including $105 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), $15 million in Buying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\"), and $15 million in Cost of goods sold, related to Change for Growth program activity. We expect to realize approximately $100 to $125 million in incremental cost savings through Fiscal 2020, bringing the total expected cost savings from these activities, when combined with the $65 million cost savings achieved during Fiscal 2017, to approximately $300 to $325 million. These cost savings are achieved through (i) operating expense reductions in the areas of professional services, travel and facilities management, among others, (ii) refinement of our operating model to eliminate duplicative overhead, and increase utilization of our brand services functions, (iii) creating a platform that reduces product costs and improves information technology efficiencies and (iv) reduced rent expense resulting from store closures or negotiated rent reductions. These cost savings are expected to be realized in our segment operating results generally in proportion to their sales, and serve to offset ongoing inflationary pressure and required reinvestment to support key incremental business initiatives.\nWe may incur significant additional charges and capital expenditures in future periods as we continue our efforts under the Change for Growth program, which include completing actions already started, more fully define related Change for Growth program initiatives and moving into the execution phases of those associated projects. Since the scope of such efforts are not fully known at this time, the benefits of such initiatives, and any related charges or capital expenditures, are not currently quantifiable. Actions associated with the Change for Growth program are currently expected to continue through Fiscal 2019.\nIntegration of ANN\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we substantially completed our integration of ANN INC. (\"ANN\" or the \"ANN integration\") into our existing operations and realized cost savings of approximately $45 million during Fiscal 2018, with approximately $25 million related to our ongoing Cost of goods sold initiative at our Premium Fashion segment and approximately $20 million in SG&A synergies primarily related to non-merchandise procurement savings. We expect to realize additional synergies related to the integration of approximately $30 million, which are expected to be substantially realized in Fiscal 2019. Once completed, we continue to expect that the total synergies and cost savings related to the ANN integration, including amounts achieved from Fiscal 2016 through Fiscal 2019, will be approximately $235 million.\nDistribution and Fulfillment\nOver the last few years, (i) our brands' distribution and fulfillment capability was centralized into our brick-and-mortar store distribution facility in Etna, Ohio and our direct channel fulfillment facility in Greencastle, Indiana which has resulted in increased processing efficiencies, and (ii) we entered into a lease agreement for a distribution center in Riverside, California to serve as the receiving and west coast distribution hub for merchandise sourced from Asia. During Fiscal 2018, we completed the expansion of our Riverside facility to include both brick-and-mortar and direct channel distribution, and we introduced direct fulfillment capability at our Etna facility to further increase our capacity in this growing channel. We continue to explore ways to optimize and leverage our integrated distribution network, which may include providing such services to third parties.\nSourcing\nOur brands source their products through a variety of sourcing channels including internally through our ascena Global Sourcing (\"aGS\") subsidiary and externally through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends. We continue to increase the penetration of internally sourced products and manage our relationships with third-party buying agents.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOmni-channel Expansion\nWe continue to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel strategies. During Fiscal 2018, we also expanded the functionality of our Riverside, California distribution center and it now supports both our brick-and-mortar and direct channel operations. During Fiscal 2018, we continued to develop technology solutions which will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur individual segments are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back-to-school shopping periods. In particular, sales at our Kids Fashion segment tend to be significantly higher during the fall season, which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, as this includes the back-to-school period and the December holiday season. Our Plus Fashion segment tends to experience higher sales during the spring season, which include the Easter and Mother's Day holidays. Our Premium Fashion and Value Fashion segments have relatively balanced sales across the Fall and Spring seasons. As a result, our operational results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFiscal Period\nAs disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we recognized an additional week during Fiscal 2018 as we conformed our fiscal calendar to that of the National Retail Federation.\nPerformance of the Value Fashion segment\nDuring Fiscal 2018, in connection with the Company's ongoing review of the Value Fashion segment, the Company made certain senior management changes in the segment with a view towards improving its performance. This review resulted in additional clearance markdowns to improve inventory composition as of the end of Fiscal 2018, as well as impairment charges related to certain under-performing retail store assets. The Company plans to continue to pursue initiatives to improve the segment's performance and to optimize shareholder value.\nImpact of Hurricanes\nDuring the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, our business was impacted by three hurricanes that disrupted normal operations at approximately 600 of our retail stores in the south-central and southeast areas of the United States, as well as Puerto Rico. These stores were impacted by the hurricanes, either as a result of damage incurred or declines in customer traffic. Almost all of the stores damaged in the hurricanes have resumed operations. We have substantially completed our assessment of the damages associated with these events and estimate that our results were negatively impacted by approximately $11 million of sales losses, a portion of which may be recovered through business interruption insurance claims. As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we have received approximately $2 million in recoveries from these insurance claims. Other than the impact of the sales losses, the hurricanes did not have a material impact on our business or results from operations.\nSummary and Key Developments\nOur Fiscal 2018 operating results were impacted by a decline in store traffic and a more promotional selling environment, along with under-performance at the dressbarn brand which led to non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets and incremental markdowns to sell through excess inventory. These items were partially mitigated by improved operating results in our Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion segments, costs and savings related to our Change for Growth program and costs and synergies from the continued integration of our Premium Fashion segment, which was acquired in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOperating highlights for Fiscal 2018 are as follows:\n \u2022 Comparable sales decreased by 2%, reflecting declines at our Premium Fashion, Value Fashion and Plus Fashion segments offset in part by an increase at our Kids Fashion segment; \n \u2022 Gross margin rate decreased by 40 basis points to 57.6% primarily reflecting incremental shipping costs of approximately $43 million across the segments as a result of increased mix of direct channel sales, and a 280 basis point decline at our dressbarn brand; \n \u2022 SG&A expenses decreased by 1.5% and included $34.0 million of non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets, primarily at our dressbarn brand; \n \u2022 Operating income increased to $34.3 million compared to an operating loss of $1,313.8 million for the year-ago period, with the improvement primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the year-ago period; and \n \u2022 Net loss per diluted share of $0.20 in Fiscal 2018, compared to net loss per diluted share of $5.48 for Fiscal 2017. \nLiquidity for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 Net cash from operations was $273.9 million, compared to $343.6 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in prepaid rent of approximately $50 million due to timing of payments; \n \u2022 Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $134.4 million, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $186.3 million offset in part by proceeds from the sale of assets, compared to $268.9 million in the year-ago period, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $258.1 million; and \n \u2022 Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $226.2 million, consisting primarily of term loan repayments of $225.0 million, compared to $120.9 million in the year-ago period, consisting primarily of term loan repayments of $122.5 million. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nThe following table summarizes our operational results and expresses the percentage relationship to net sales of certain financial statement captions:\n\n_________\n(a) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the benefit for income taxes by the loss before the benefit for income taxes.\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nNet sales. Net sales decreased by $71.5 million, or 1.1%, to $6,578.3 million in Fiscal 2018 from $6,649.8 million in the year-ago period. The decline in net sales primarily reflected a 2% decline in comparable sales that mainly resulted from a 6.7% decline in net sales at our Value Fashion segment, as well as product assortment challenges during the first half of Fiscal 2018 experienced by the Premium Fashion segment, which returned to positive comp performance in the second half of Fiscal 2018. Non-comparable sales declined by $73.0 million, or 37.1%, to $123.6 million from $196.6 million, as discussed on a segment basis below. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues increased by $5.2 million, or 2.5%, to $212.8 million from $207.6 million. Net sales for all four segments also included incremental revenues of $113.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 as previously discussed.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales data for our four operating segments is presented below.\n\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and direct channel sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in stores only open in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Direct channel sales refer to growth of sales from our direct channel in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year. Due to customer cross-channel behavior, we report a single, consolidated comparable sales metric, inclusive of store and direct channels.\n(b) Incremental revenues of approximately $113.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 are excluded from the calculation of comparable sales.\n (c) During Fiscal 2018, vouchers distributed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 in connection with the Justice pricing litigation, discussed more fully in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, began to be redeemed. Comparable sales related to these transactions includes the transaction value in excess of the voucher value. \nPremium Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 5% comparable sales decline of $37.3 million at Ann Taylor, and a less than 1% comparable sales decline of $7.3 million at LOFT; \n \u2022 a $4.9 million increase in non-comparable sales primarily reflecting a net positive impact at LOFT, as the impact of 8 store openings more than offset the impact of 14 store closures, which was offset in part by the negative impact of 18 net store closures at Ann Taylor; \n \u2022 a $24.6 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $10.3 million increase in other revenues primarily related to higher gift card breakage and higher credit revenue. \nValue Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 10% comparable sales decline of $86.8 million at dressbarn and a 4% comparable sales decline of $35.2 million at maurices; \n \u2022 a $38.2 million decline in non-comparable sales substantially all at dressbarn reflecting 49 store closures; \n \u2022 a $32.6 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $2.1 million decline in other revenues. \nPlus Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 1% comparable sales decline of $7.9 million at Lane Bryant and a 3% comparable sales decline of $9.6 million at Catherines; \n \u2022 an $11.0 million decline in non-comparable sales at Lane Bryant due to 15 net store closures and a $7.0 million decline in non-comparable sales at Catherines due to 11 net store closures; \n \u2022 a $20.7 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $0.9 million increase in other revenues. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nKids Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 7% comparable sales increase of $67.4 million at Justice; \n \u2022 a $21.7 million decline in non-comparable sales primarily due to 53 net store closures; \n \u2022 a $35.1 million increase due to the inclusion of the 53rd week period; and \n \u2022 a $3.9 million decline in other revenues primarily due to lower wholesale revenue. \nGross margin. Gross margin, in terms of dollars decreased as a result of the decline in comparable sales as well as a decline in gross margin rate. Gross margin rate, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in Fiscal 2018 from 58.0% in Fiscal 2017. Improved performance at our Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion segments was offset by declines at our Premium Fashion and Value Fashion segments. On a consolidated basis, gross margin reflects higher shipping costs of approximately $43 million across the segments as a result of an increased mix of direct channel sales and higher air freight costs, offset by the realization of approximately $40 million in synergies and cost savings benefits achieved from product sourcing and transportation costs.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period.\nGross margin rate highlights on a segment basis are as follows:\n \u2022 Premium Fashion gross margin rate performance declined by approximately 60 basis points, reflecting higher shipping costs related to increased direct channel penetration and an increased level of promotional selling resulting from soft product acceptance during the first half of Fiscal 2018, offset in part by the segment's cost of goods sold initiative. \n \u2022 Value Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 150 basis, points caused primarily by a 280 basis point decline at dressbarn. The decline mainly reflects higher markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels, a higher level of promotional selling, particularly at dressbarn, due to lower than expected customer demand, and higher shipping costs related to the increased direct channel penetration. \n \u2022 Plus Fashion gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 30 basis points, reflecting improved product acceptance and lower levels of promotional selling, offset in part by higher shipping costs related to the increased direct channel penetration. \n \u2022 Kids Fashion gross margin rate performance improved approximately 90 basis points, resulting from improved product acceptance, offset in part by incremental freight expenses necessary to meet higher product demand. \nBuying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\") expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses increased by $6.8 million, or 0.5%, to $1,281.1 million in Fiscal 2018 from $1,274.3 million in Fiscal 2017. Higher buying costs and variable distribution costs related to the increased penetration of our direct channel business were partly offset by lower occupancy expenses related to our fleet optimization program, which provided approximately $15 million of cost savings during Fiscal 2018. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 30 basis points to 19.5% in Fiscal 2018 from 19.2% in Fiscal 2017, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $31.8 million, or 1.5%, to $2,036.7 million in Fiscal 2018 from $2,068.5 million in Fiscal 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to approximately $125 million in synergies and cost reduction initiatives, mainly reflecting headcount and non-merchandise procurement savings. Also contributing to the decrease were lower store expenses, resulting from the fleet optimization program, and lower performance-based compensation. These items were offset in part by inflationary increases, higher write-downs of store related fixed assets, primarily at the Value Fashion segment, and the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2018 recorded for all of the segments. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nby 10 basis points to 31.0% in Fiscal 2018 from 31.1% in Fiscal 2017, and reflects the impact of the reduced expenses, offset in part by the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $29.4 million, or 7.6%, to $355.5 million in Fiscal 2018 from $384.9 million in Fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in store count resulting from our fleet optimization program, offset in part by incremental depreciation from capital investments.\nOperating income (loss). Operating income was $34.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared to an operating loss of $1,313.8 million in Fiscal 2017 and is discussed on a segment basis below.\nOperating results for our four operating segments are presented below.\n\n_______\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nPremium Fashion operating income decreased by $5.7 million primarily due to lower comparable sales and gross margin rate as discussed above, offset in part by a decrease in SG&A expenses. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation, and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nValue Fashion operating results decreased by $95.4 million primarily due to lower comparable sales and gross margin rate, as discussed above, and an increase in SG&A expenses, which were offset in part by lower BD&O expenses. The lower BD&O expenses primarily reflect lower occupancy expenses associated with our fleet optimization program. The higher SG&A expenses primarily reflect higher non-cash charges to write-down store-related fixed assets as previously discussed, offset in part by a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nPlus Fashion operating income increased by $11.6 million primarily due to an increase in the gross margin rate, as discussed above, and a decrease in SG&A expenses, which were offset in part by higher BD&O expenses and a decrease in comparable sales, also discussed above. The higher BD&O expenses primarily reflect the increased penetration of our direct channel business. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by a decrease in administrative payroll costs, lower marketing expenses, and other cost savings initiatives, mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nKids Fashion operating income increased by $75.8 million primarily due to an increase in comparable sales and gross margin rate, as discussed above, as well as lower SG&A expenses. SG&A expense reductions were primarily driven by lower store expenses associated with our fleet optimization program, lower marketing expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nUnallocated acquisition and integration expenses of $5.4 million for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's distribution operations, including the closure of the former ANN distribution facility in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the gain on the related sale of that facility, which occurred in Fiscal 2018. The $39.4 million of unallocated acquisition and integration expenses in Fiscal 2017 represents costs related to the ANN Acquisition consisting of $14.3\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nmillion of severance and retention costs, $8.0 million of settlement charges and professional fees related to the termination of the pension plan acquired in the ANN Acquisition, and $17.1 million of other costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's operations.\nUnallocated restructuring and other related charges reflects costs incurred under the Change for Growth program. Expenses of $78.5 million for Fiscal 2018 included $59.2 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of transformation initiatives, $5.2 million of severance and other related expenses, and asset impairments of $14.1 million reflecting decisions within the fleet optimization program to close certain under-performing stores as well as a write-down of a building. The $81.9 million of unallocated restructuring and other related charges in Fiscal 2017 represents $33.2 million of severance and other related expenses, $15.3 million for charges related to fleet optimization program and $33.4 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of transformation initiatives.\nUnallocated impairment of goodwill reflects the Fiscal 2017 write-down of the carrying values of the reporting units to their fair values and is included in our operating segments as follows: $428.9 million at our Premium Fashion segment, $107.2 million at our Value Fashion segment and $60.2 million at our Plus Fashion segment. There was no unallocated impairment of goodwill in Fiscal 2018.\nUnallocated impairment of intangible assets reflects the Fiscal 2017 write-down of our trade name intangible assets to their fair values as follows: $210.0 million of our Ann Taylor trade name, $356.3 million of our LOFT trade name and $161.8 million of our Lane Bryant trade name. There was no unallocated impairment of intangible assets in Fiscal 2018.\nInterest expense increased by $10.8 million to $113.0 million for Fiscal 2018 from $102.2 million in Fiscal 2017, primarily caused by a higher interest rate on our term loan.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. During Fiscal 2018, the company made repayments of $180.0 million which were applied towards future scheduled quarterly payments of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan debt, resulting in a $5.0 million pre-tax loss reflecting the acceleration of deferred financing fees.\nBenefit for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. We recorded a benefit of $41.8 million in Fiscal 2018 on a pre-tax loss of $81.5 million, for an effective tax rate of 51.3%, which reflects the provisional impact of recording the tax effects associated with the 2017 Act discussed in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. This was offset by the impact of recording a valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets also discussed in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accounting for the tax effects of share-based compensation discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In Fiscal 2017, we recorded a benefit of $346.9 million on a pre-tax loss of $1,414.2 million for a 24.5% effective tax rate. The effective annual tax rate for Fiscal 2017 is lower than the statutory federal and state tax rate primarily as $526.5 million of the impairment of goodwill is non-deductible for income tax purposes and is treated as a permanent difference.\nNet loss decreased to $39.7 million in Fiscal 2018 from $1,067.3 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, net of the related income tax benefit, recorded in the year-ago period as discussed above.\nNet loss per diluted common share was to $0.20 per share in Fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of $5.48 per share in the year-ago period due to lower net loss discussed above.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nThe following table summarizes our operational results and expresses the percentage relationship to net sales of certain financial statement captions:\n\n_________\n(a) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the benefit (provision) for income taxes by the loss before the benefit (provision) for income taxes.\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nNet sales. Net sales decreased by $345.6 million, or 4.9%, to $6,649.8 million in Fiscal 2017 from $6,995.4 million in Fiscal 2016. The decline in net sales primarily reflected a 5% decline in comparable sales which was offset in part by three additional weeks of net sales for the Premium Fashion segment in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 which included only the 49-week post-acquisition period. The comparable sales decline resulted from reduced store traffic. Non-comparable sales decreased by $23.5 million, or 14.0%, to $144.2 million from $167.7 million, as discussed on a segment basis below. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues increased by $8.8 million, or 6.1%, to $152.2 million from $143.4 million. Also contributing to the decline was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016, which represented an incremental $82 million in net sales in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales data for our four operating segments is presented below.\n\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and direct channel sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in stores only open in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Direct channel sales refer to growth of sales from our direct channel in the current period and comparative calendar period in the prior year. Due to customer cross-channel behavior, we report a single, consolidated comparable sales metric, inclusive of store and direct channels.\nPremium Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 52-week period compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a 7% comparable sales decline at Ann Taylor and a 4% comparable sales decline at LOFT; and \n \u2022 18 net store closures at Ann Taylor and 4 net store closures at LOFT. \nValue Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 9% comparable sales decline of $88.7 million at maurices and a 5% comparable sales decline of $46.6 million at dressbarn; \n \u2022 a $22.4 million increase in non-comparable sales due to 12 net store openings at maurices, offset in part by a $19.8 million decline in non-comparable sales due to 30 net store closures at dressbarn; \n \u2022 a $34.5 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $22.8 million increase in other revenues primarily due to the segment's new private label credit card program. \nPlus Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 7% comparable sales decline of $67.3 million at Lane Bryant and a 4% comparable sales decline of $11.3 million at Catherines; \n \u2022 a $2.3 million decline in non-comparable sales due to 8 net store closures at Lane Bryant and 14 net store closures at Catherines; \n \u2022 a $23.0 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $5.8 million decline in other revenues due to lower revenue from product sell-off and gift card breakage. \nKids Fashion net sales performance in Fiscal 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a 3% comparable sales decline of $26.3 million at Justice; \n \u2022 a $23.8 million decline in non-comparable sales caused by 37 net store closures; \n \u2022 a $24.9 million decline due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $8.2 million decline in other revenues due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nGross margin. Gross margin rate, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased by 180 basis points from 56.2% in Fiscal 2016 to 58.0% in Fiscal 2017. The increase was due to an approximate $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory to fair market value recorded during Fiscal 2016 in our Premium Fashion segment. Excluding the prior year impact of the inventory amortization, gross margin rate was essentially flat, as improved performance at our Premium Fashion and Plus Fashion segments was offset by declines at our Value Fashion and Kids Fashion segments. On a consolidated basis, gross margin benefited from the realization of approximately $55 million in combined integration synergies and cost savings related to our ongoing supply chain integration and the cost of goods sold initiatives at its Premium Fashion segment.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period.\nGross margin rate highlights on a segment basis are as follows:\n \u2022 Premium Fashion gross margin rate performance reflected an approximate $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory recorded during Fiscal 2016 discussed above. Excluding the prior year impact of the inventory amortization, gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 220 basis points, reflecting significant improvement at both Ann Taylor and LOFT. Both brands benefited from realization of freight cost synergies related to our ongoing supply chain integration and the segment's cost of goods sold initiative. \n \u2022 Value Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 110 basis points, resulting from a higher level of promotional selling across the segment and increased markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels on lower than expected customer demand. \n \u2022 Plus Fashion gross margin rate performance improved by approximately 120 basis points, mainly due to more effective inventory management at both Lane Bryant and Catherines. \n \u2022 Kids Fashion gross margin rate performance declined approximately 370 basis points, resulting from a higher level of promotional selling and increased markdown requirements to maintain appropriate inventory levels on lower than expected customer demand. \nBuying, distribution and occupancy (\"BD&O\") expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses decreased by $12.2 million, or 0.9%, to $1,274.3 million in Fiscal 2017 from $1,286.5 million in Fiscal 2016. BD&O expenses for the Premium Fashion segment increased by $14.7 million primarily as the results reflected a 52-week period in Fiscal 2017 compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016. For our other segments, BD&O expenses decreased by $26.9 million primarily due to lower occupancy expenses on a reduced store count and lower performance-based compensation. On a consolidated basis, BD&O expenses also included approximately $10 million in transformation initiatives and approximately $10 million of synergies related to the ANN Acquisition associated with the consolidation of the Premium Fashion segment brands into our ecommerce fulfillment center. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 80 basis points to 19.2% in Fiscal 2017 from 18.4% in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $43.8 million, or 2.1%, to $2,068.5 million in Fiscal 2017 from $2,112.3 million in Fiscal 2016. SG&A expenses for the Premium Fashion segment increased by $25.2 million primarily as the results reflected a 52-week period in Fiscal 2017 compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016. For our other segments, SG&A expenses decreased by $69.0 million primarily due to store closures and the lower sales volume, reduced marketing expenses, lower performance-based compensation and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program. On a consolidated basis, SG&A expenses also included approximately $85 million in synergies and transformation initiatives, primarily due to the elimination of redundant leadership and non-merchandise procurement savings. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nsales increased by 90 basis points to 31.1% in Fiscal 2017 from 30.2% in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the de-leveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $26.2 million, or 7.3%, to $384.9 million in Fiscal 2017 from $358.7 million in Fiscal 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense for the Premium Fashion segment increased by $6.2 million primarily as the results reflected a 52-week period in Fiscal 2017 compared to the 49-week post-acquisition period in Fiscal 2016. For our other segments, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20.0 million primarily due to our direct channel platform investment which was placed in service in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 period and investments in our distribution network primarily to integrate the operations of ANN.\nOperating (loss) income. Operating loss was $1,313.8 million for Fiscal 2017 compared to operating income of $93.8 million for Fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as the decrease in operating results discussed on a segment basis below. The operating results for Fiscal 2016 reflected an approximately $127 million non-cash purchase accounting expense related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory to fair market value recorded in our Premium Fashion segment.\nOperating results for our four operating segments is presented below.\n\n_______\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nPremium Fashion operating income increased by $127.6 million as a result of lower non-cash purchase accounting expenses primarily due to approximately $127 million related to the write-up of inventory to fair market value recorded in Fiscal 2016. The operating results for Fiscal 2017 reflected an improvement in gross margin rate, partially offset by lower comparable sales, both discussed above. Operating expenses for Fiscal 2017 reflected lower performance-based compensation, synergies savings associated with the transition into our direct channel fulfillment center, lower occupancy expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program and integration-related activities.\nValue Fashion operating income decreased by $79.8 million as a result of the decreases in net sales and gross margin rate, both discussed above, as well as an increase in depreciation expense, offset in part by decreases in operating expenses. Operating expense reductions were driven by lower performance-based compensation, lower store variable expenses resulting from the decrease in sales volume and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nPlus Fashion operating income decreased by $21.4 million as a result of the decrease in net sales and an increase in depreciation expense. These items were offset in part by an improvement in gross margin rate and decreased operating expenses. Operating expense reductions were driven by lower occupancy expenses, reduced marketing expenses and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nKids Fashion operating results decreased by $65.7 million as a result of the decreases in net sales and gross margin rate and the additional peak back-to-school week included in Fiscal 2016 as a result of the 53rd week, offset in part by a decrease in operating expenses. The impact of the additional peak back-to-school week in Fiscal 2016 was approximately $10 million. Operating expense reductions were driven by lower occupancy expenses, lower performance-based compensation and a decrease in administrative payroll costs mainly associated with the Change for Growth program.\nUnallocated acquisition and integration expenses of $39.4 million for Fiscal 2017 included $14.3 million of severance and retention costs, $8.0 million of settlement charges and professional fees related to the termination of the pension plan acquired in the ANN Acquisition, and $17.1 million of other costs associated with the post-acquisition integration of ANN's operations. The $77.4 million of unallocated acquisition and integration expenses in Fiscal 2016 represents costs related to the ANN Acquisition consisting of $20.8 million of legal, consulting and investment-banking related transaction costs, $37.5 million of severance and retention-related expenses and $17.3 million of integration costs primarily to combine the operations and infrastructure of the ANN business.\nUnallocated restructuring and other related charges of $81.9 million for Fiscal 2017 included $33.2 million of severance and other related expenses, $15.3 million for charges related to the fleet optimization program and $33.4 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the identification and implementation of the transformation initiatives associated with the Change for Growth program. There was no unallocated restructuring and other related charges in Fiscal 2016.\nUnallocated impairment of goodwill of $596.3 million for Fiscal 2017 reflects the write-down of the carrying values of the reporting units to their fair values and is included in our operating segments as follows: $428.9 million at our Premium Fashion segment, $107.2 million at our Value Fashion segment and $60.2 million at our Plus Fashion segment. There was no unallocated impairment of goodwill in Fiscal 2016.\nUnallocated impairment of intangible assets of $728.1 million for Fiscal 2017 reflects the write down of our trade name intangible assets to their fair values as follows: $210.0 million of our Ann Taylor trade name, $356.3 million of our LOFT trade name and $161.8 million of our Lane Bryant trade name. There was no unallocated impairment of intangible assets in Fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense decreased by $1.1 million to $102.2 million for Fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of the principal redemptions and repayments of the term loan during Fiscal 2017, mostly offset by a higher interest rate and an additional three weeks of interest expense on the term loan for Fiscal 2017 due to the timing of the ANN Acquisition.\nGain on extinguishment of debt. During Fiscal 2016, we repurchased $72.0 million of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan debt at an aggregate cost of $68.4 million through open market transactions, resulting in a $0.8 million pre-tax gain, net of the proportional write-off of unamortized original issuance discount and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The benefit (provision) for income taxes increased by $350.5 million to a benefit of $346.9 million in Fiscal 2017 from a provision of $3.6 million in Fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was 24.5% for Fiscal 2017 and negative 43.4% for Fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate computing the benefit on the pre-tax loss for Fiscal 2017 is lower than the statutory federal and state tax rate primarily as $526.5 million of the goodwill impairment charge is non-deductible for income tax purposes and is treated as a permanent difference. The negative effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 despite a net loss was primarily due to state and local taxes and certain expenses which were non-deductible for income tax purposes.\nNet loss increased by $1,055.4 million to $1,067.3 million in Fiscal 2017 from $11.9 million in Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as lower operating results discussed above.\nNet loss per diluted common share increased by $5.42 to $5.48 per share in Fiscal 2017 from $0.06 per share in Fiscal 2016 due to the higher net loss discussed above.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years presented as follows:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $273.9 million for Fiscal 2018, compared with $343.6 million during the year-ago period. Cash provided by operations was lower during Fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower net income before non-cash expenses and higher working capital outflows in Fiscal 2018, primarily related to timing of payments for store rent expense of approximately $50 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2018 was $134.4 million, compared with $268.9 million for the year-ago period. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $186.3 million, offset in part by $52.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, which substantially reflects the redemption of cash surrender value on certain company-owned life insurance policies. Net cash used in investing activities in the year-ago period was $268.9 million, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of $258.1 million and the purchase of an intangible asset of $11.6 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $226.2 million during Fiscal 2018, consisting primarily of $225.0 million of principal repayments of our term loan debt. Net cash used in financing activities was $120.9 million during the year-ago period, consisting primarily of principal repayments of our term loan debt.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years presented as follows:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $343.6 million for Fiscal 2017, compared with $445.4 million during Fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operations was lower during Fiscal 2017 as lower net income and unfavorable working capital outflows related to timing of payments and lower incentive compensation accruals were offset in part by cash used for non-recurring payments made during Fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting an escrow payment of approximately $51 million for the Justice pricing litigation settlement and a payment of approximately $44 million to a former Justice executive.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2017 was $268.9 million, compared with $1,835.7 million for Fiscal 2016. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of capital expenditures\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nof $258.1 million and the purchase of an intangible asset of $11.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $1,494.6 million of cash paid in the ANN Acquisition and cash used for capital expenditures of $366.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments of $25.4 million.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $120.9 million during Fiscal 2017, consisting primarily of principal repayments of our term loan debt. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,521.5 million during Fiscal 2016, consisting primarily of $1,764.0 million of borrowing under our new term loan, offset in part by net repayments of debt under our amended revolving credit agreement of $116.0 million, $77.4 million of redemptions and principal repayments of our term loan debt and $42.6 million of payments made for deferred financing costs related to the new borrowing arrangements entered into during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nCapital Spending\nIn Fiscal 2018, we had $186.3 million in capital expenditures, which included spending for non-routine capital investments including our omni-channel platform and initiatives identified with the Change for Growth program, as well as routine spending in connection with our digital initiatives, infrastructure, and our retail store network. The most significant non-routine initiatives are described below.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we continued to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel capability. We completed the expansion of our Riverside, California facility to include the direct channel, as well as brick-and-mortar distribution. Additionally, during Fiscal 2018, we continued to develop technology solutions which will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support more effective product and marketing decisions. Also, in connection with the Change for Growth program, we spent approximately $40 million in Fiscal 2018 and expect to spend approximately $30 million in Fiscal 2019 on projects to improve operational efficiency and enhance our customer-facing capabilities.\nWe expect that total capital spending for Fiscal 2019, including (i) routine spending, (ii) technological spending for the projects discussed above, and (iii) spending required to support the Change for Growth program, will be in the range of $180-$210 million. Our routine and non-routine capital requirements are expected to be funded primarily with available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and, to the extent necessary, borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement which is defined and discussed below.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from our operations, remaining availability under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement after taking into account outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and the collateral limitation, and available cash and cash equivalents. These sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, retail store expansion, construction and renovation of stores, investment in technological and supply chain infrastructure, acquisitions, debt servicing requirements, stock repurchases, dividends, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our operating needs, capital requirements and any debt service requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAs of August 4, 2018, approximately $44 million, or 18%, of our available cash and cash equivalents was held overseas by our foreign subsidiaries, which represents a significant reduction in our offshore cash balance from Fiscal 2017. The 2017 Act eliminated the deferral of the U.S. tax liability on offshore earnings and profits, and subjected those earnings to tax under the Transition Tax rules that were part of the 2017 Act. The assessment of the Transition Tax meant that our offshore cash and offshore earnings could be repatriated at minimal tax cost. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we repatriated approximately $273 million of our foreign cash back to the U.S. Any remaining offshore cash balances are required to meet the working capital needs of the Company's offshore businesses or are subject to foreign exchange control regulations. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for our remaining foreign held cash balances and will repatriate any excess cash balances as necessary.\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had $472.9 million of availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nDebt\nFor a detailed description of the terms and restrictions under our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated February 27, 2018 (the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\") and the $1.8 billion seven-year term loan (the \"Term Loan\"), see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAmended Revolving Credit Agreement\nWe believe that our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. We were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement as of August 4, 2018. The Amended Revolving Credit Agreement extends the maturity of the Company's revolving credit facility from August 2020 to the earlier of (i) 5 years from the closing date (or February 2023) or (ii) 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Term Loans (unless (a) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans is $150 million or less and (b) the Company maintains liquidity (which can include (1) availability under the credit facility in excess of the greater of $100 million and 20% of the credit limit and (2) cash held in a controlled account of the administrative agent of the revolving credit facility) in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the remaining Term Loans, as described in more detail in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to continue to support our operating needs and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nTerm Loan\nFor Fiscal 2018, we repaid a total of $225.0 million term loan debt of which $180.0 million was applied to future quarterly scheduled payments such that we are not required to make a quarterly payment until November of Fiscal 2021. We may from time to time seek to repay or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt arrangements, among other factors.\nAdditionally, we expect to incur cash interest expense of approximately $91 million on the Term Loan in Fiscal 2019 based on the outstanding balance and interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018. Such interest and principal payments are expected to be funded with our cash flows from operations.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThere were no purchases of common stock during Fiscal 2018 under the repurchase program. For a complete description of our 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe may from time to time continue to repurchase additional shares depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt agreements, among other factors.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of August 4, 2018, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. We expect to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe following is a description of our material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of August 4, 2018:\n \u2022 Long-term debt represents contractual payments of outstanding borrowings under our borrowing agreements as of August 4, 2018. \n \u2022 Interest payments on long-term debt represent interest payments related to our borrowing agreements. Interest payments on our Term Loan were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018 and the estimated outstanding balance, giving effect to the contractual repayments in future periods. Interest payments on our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, if any, were calculated based on the outstanding balance and the interest rates in effect as of August 4, 2018, as if the borrowings remain outstanding until repayment is required at expiration in February 2023. \n \u2022 Operating lease obligations represent the estimated minimum lease rental payments for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world and do not include incremental rentals based on a percentage of sales. Although such amounts are generally non-cancelable, certain leases are cancelable if specified sales levels are not achieved or co-tenancy requirements are not being satisfied. All future minimum rentals under these cancelable leases have been included in the above table. In addition to such amounts, we are normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to the leased real estate properties, which are not included in the table above. \n \u2022 Inventory purchase commitments represent our agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices. While a portion of these commitments may be canceled at our option up to 30 days prior to the vendor's scheduled shipment date, such commitments are generally not canceled and are included in the table above. \n \u2022 Other commitments primarily represent contractual payments related to information technology services. While these commitments may be canceled at our option for a termination fee, such commitments are generally not canceled and are included in the table above. \nExcluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $69.4 million as of August 4, 2018. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the above table because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.\nThe above table also excludes the following: (i) non-debt related amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 4, 2018, as these items will be paid within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nassociated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a \"purchase obligation\" as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items).\nWe also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Notes 15 and 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table, including obligations under employment agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit amounted to approximately $27.1 million as of August 4, 2018. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe are exposed to a variety of market-based risks, representing our potential exposure to losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. These market risks include, but are not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our Canadian operations, changes in interest rates, and changes in both the value and liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, in the normal course of business, we employ a number of established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including considering, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks. However, as a matter of policy, we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we did not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe currently do not have any significant risks related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Purchases of inventory for resale in our retail stores and direct channel operations normally are transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, our 100% owned international retail operations represent approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. In the future, if our international operations continue to expand, we may consider the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage any significant risks to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had $1,371.5 million in variable-rate debt outstanding under our borrowing agreements. Accordingly, we remain subject to changes in interest rates. For each 0.125% increase or decrease in interest rates, our interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $1.7 million, and net income would decrease or increase, respectively, by approximately $1.3 million. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms and conditions of our borrowing agreements.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of August 4, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $238.9 million. We maintain cash deposits and cash equivalents with well-known and stable financial institutions; however, there were significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at overseas financial institutions as well as FDIC-insured financial institutions that were in excess of FDIC-insured limits at the end of Fiscal 2018. This represents a concentration of credit risk. While there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date, we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe SEC's Financial Reporting Release No. 60, \"Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies\" (\"FRR 60\"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our operational results and financial position and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents the critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nRetail Inventory Method\nWe hold inventory for sale through our retail stores and direct channel sites. All of our segments, other than Premium Fashion discussed below, use the retail inventory method of accounting, under which inventory is stated at the lower of cost, on a First In, First Out ( FIFO\u201d) basis, or market. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. Inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including, among others, initial merchandise markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.\nWe continuously review the inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and markdowns necessary to clear slow-moving merchandise, which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value. Consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns, aging of inventories, historical sales trends, and the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, as well as changes in consumer preferences, market and economic conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs and the markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results.\nWeighted-average Cost Method\nThe Premium Fashion segment uses the weighted-average cost method to value inventory, under which inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market, at the individual item level. Inventory cost is adjusted when the current selling price or future estimated selling price is less than cost.\nReserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nTo assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, we review and consider an appraisal from an independent valuation firm. Estimates of fair value are determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and the timing of those cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. Estimating the fair value is judgmental in nature, which could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe fair values of the reporting units are determined using a combination of the income approach (the discounted cash flows method) and the market approach (guideline public company method and guideline transaction method). We believe that the income approach is the most reliable indication of value as it captures forecasted revenues and earnings for the reporting units in the projection period that the market approach may not directly incorporate. Therefore, a greater weighting was applied to the income approach than the market approach.\nThe assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting units identified for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment for all periods presented are ANN, Justice, Lane Bryant, maurices, dressbarn and Catherines, each of which represents the lowest level where discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment managers.\nFiscal 2018 Impairment Assessment\nIn the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we performed our annual impairment assessment (the \"Fiscal 2018 Valuation\"). While dressbarn does not have goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets and the fair values of ANN, Lane Bryant, and Justice were all significantly in excess of their respective book values, the fair values of the maurices and Catherines reporting units exceeded their book values by less than 15% and are discussed below. In addition, while the fair value of most of our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their respective book values, the fair values of the LOFT and maurices trade names exceeded their respective book value by approximately 15% or less.\nmaurices and Catherines Fair Values\nThe Fiscal 2018 Valuation indicated maurices fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14% and that the Catherines fair value approximated its carrying value. As of August 4, 2018, maurices and Catherines had a goodwill balance of $93.5 million and $49.3 million, respectively.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included: a weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") of 14.0% for both maurices and Catherines, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks; operating income margin of mid-to-high single digits and a terminal growth rate of 2%. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $24 million at maurices and $5 million at Catherines. A hypothetical 1% change in the operating income percentages in all periods would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $58 million at maurices and $17 million at Catherines. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the terminal growth rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $15 million at maurices and $3 million at Catherines.\nLOFT and maurices Trade Names\nThe Fiscal 2018 Valuation indicated the fair value of our LOFT and maurices trade names exceeded their carrying value by approximately 15% and 11%, respectively. As of August 4, 2018, LOFT and maurices had trade name balances of $200.0 million and $89.0 million, respectively.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included the WACC and the royalty rate. The WACC selected was 14.5% for both trade names, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks. The royalty rate for the LOFT trade name was 2.0% and for the maurices trade name was 1.5%. The royalty rate selection was based on consideration of rates paid within third-party licensing transactions involving similar assets as well as an analysis of the profit margins expected to be generated by each brand. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $20 million at LOFT and $10 million at maurices. A hypothetical 0.5% change in the royalty rate would change the fair value by approximately $60 million at LOFT and $30 million at maurices.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nGeneral\nIt is possible that a shortfall in the cash flows from the amounts estimated in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation may result in a future impairment loss. As discussed earlier in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview, our brick and mortar store traffic remained a headwind for most of Fiscal 2018 and competition for consumer spending remains strong. As a result, we expect a highly promotional operating environment to continue into Fiscal 2019. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, industry and market trends and entity-specific risks and evaluate their impact on the valuation of our reporting units. For example, if we continue to experience sustained periods of declines or shifts in consumer spending, or fail to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Change for Growth Program, it could adversely impact the long-term assumptions used in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation. Such trends may also have a negative impact on other key assumptions used in the Fiscal 2018 Valuation, including anticipated gross margin and operating income margin, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate. These assumptions are highly judgmental and subject to change. We will conduct the 2019 assessment of goodwill and intangible assets as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, unless other indicators warrant an interim assessment.\nShould declines in our performance occur, or if our expectations regarding future performance decline, these conditions could adversely impact the valuation of our goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, particularly at the maurices and Catherines reporting units and the LOFT and maurices trade names, but also at our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets that exceeded or substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and we may be required to undertake impairment testing earlier than the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019. These declines could also adversely impact our other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Such changes, if material, may require us to incur additional material impairment charges for such goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, and may also require us to write-off all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in future periods.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of, and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $34.0 million, $21.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived tangible assets to their estimated fair value. Additionally, we incurred incremental store impairment charges of $15.2 million and $14.0 million in Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with the Change for Growth program, which are included within Restructuring and other related charges. There have been no impairment losses recorded on our finite-lived intangible assets for any of the periods presented. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on impairments of long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year, and include the results of any differences between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carry forwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. We account for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nValuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This determination requires significant judgment by management. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed quarterly and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. If we continue to experience sustained periods of unexpected declines in consumer spending, or fail to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Change for Growth Program, it could adversely impact our assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets. Such changes, if material, may require us to write-off all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in future periods.\nWe also establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we consider that a tax position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of limitation expires or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.\nIn December 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Act\") was signed into law. The 2017 Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that began to affect us in Fiscal 2018 and beyond. We are still in the process of determining the full impact of the 2017 Act; however, based on our current interpretation of the 2017 Act, we made reasonable estimates to record provisional amounts during Fiscal 2018. In that regard, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the 2017 Act enactment date of December 22, 2017 for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d (\"ASC 740\"). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the 2017 Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act is incomplete, but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 Act. The determinations made in applying the 2017 Act require significant judgment by management. We will continue to refine our estimates within the measurement period allowed, which will be completed no later than the second quarter of Fiscal 2019.
