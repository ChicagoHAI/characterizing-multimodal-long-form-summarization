Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide the reader of the Company's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. This MD&A includes the following sections: Overview, Highlights, Results of Operations, Performance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Critical Accounting Policies, Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Related Parties. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 15 of this report.\n\ufeff\nIn order to show the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, we have included constant currency disclosures, where necessary, in the Overview and Results of Operations sections which follow. Constant currency disclosures represent the translation of our current fiscal year revenues and expenses from the functional currencies of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We use results on a constant currency basis as one of the measures to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Results on a constant currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( non-GAAP\u201d) and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOverview\n\ufeff\nThe Company\n\ufeff\nWD-40 Company ( the Company\u201d), based in San Diego, California, is a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products which solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world. We market our maintenance products and our homecare and cleaning products under the following well-known brands: WD-40\u00ae, 3-IN-ONE\u00ae, GT85\u00ae, X-14\u00ae, 2000 Flushes\u00ae, Carpet Fresh\u00ae, no vac\u00ae, Spot Shot\u00ae, 1001\u00ae, Lava\u00ae and Solvol\u00ae. Currently included in the WD-40 brand are the WD-40 multi-use product and the WD-40 Specialist\u00ae and WD-40 BIKE\u00ae product lines.\n\ufeff\nOur brands are sold in various locations around the world. Maintenance products are sold worldwide in markets throughout North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Homecare and cleaning products are sold primarily in North America, the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) and Australia. We sell our products primarily through mass retail and home center stores, warehouse club stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, sport retailers, independent bike dealers, online retailers and industrial distributors and suppliers.\nHighlights\n\ufeff\nThe following summarizes the financial and operational highlights for our business during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016:\n\ufeff\nTable 20: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated net sales increased $2.5 million, or 1%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.

This sales increase was mainly driven by higher sales of maintenance products in the U.S. and Latin America, which increased 6% and 3%, respectively, from period to period. The sales increase in the U.S. was primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities for all maintenance products and the added distribution of our new WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw product. The sales increase in Latin America was primarily due to the success of certain promotional programs which were conducted in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, primarily those in Mexico and Chile, as well as the continued growth of the WD-40 multi-use product throughout the Latin America region. The sales increases in the U.S. and Latin America were partially offset by a sales decrease in Canada of 14%, from period to period. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales associated with promotional programs, most of which was driven by unstable market and economic conditions, particularly in the industrial channel in Western Canada as a result of reduced activity in the oil industry. In addition, sales in Canada were negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates form period to period. Also contributing to the overall sales increase of maintenance products in the Americas segment was higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, which were up $1.1 million, or 10%, from period to period due to new distribution, particularly of certain new products within this product line during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.\n\ufeff\nSales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment decreased $2.6 million, or 9%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This sales decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Spot Shot carpet stain remover and 2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners, most of which is related to the U.S., of 13% and 7%, respectively. While each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows, we have continued to experience decreased or flat sales for many of these products primarily due to lost distribution, reduced product offerings, competition, category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers, particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels. At August 31, 2016, the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets associated with the Company's trade names for the homecare and cleaning products was $16.8 million, of which $9.3 million and $4.3 million were associated with the Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes trade names, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFor the Americas segment, 83% of sales came from the U.S., and 17% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year when 82% of sales came from the U.S., and 18% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined.\nEMEA\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\ufeff\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,217 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(513) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,018 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,117 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,099) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(15)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>135,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>136,847 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,612) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 30: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWhile the Company's reporting currency is U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales for the EMEA segment from period to period. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 translated at the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year would have been $146.5 million in the EMEA segment.

Overall, sales from direct markets increased $1.2 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the direct markets in EMEA from period to period. On a constant currency basis, sales in the direct markets would have increased by 10% from fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe experienced sales increases throughout most of the EMEA direct markets for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, with percentage increases in sales as follows: the Germanics region, 10%; Italy, 9%; and France, 1%. Sales increases in these direct markets were primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 multi-use product, particularly in the Germanics region. Sales in the Germanics increased from period to period due to a change in the distribution model for the do-it-yourself (DIY) channel that we made for this region in fiscal year 2015. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from a distribution model for this channel where we sold product through a large wholesale customer who then supplied various retail customers to one where we sell direct to these retail customers. Due to the successful build of our direct customer base in this new model in fiscal year 2016, sales in this region were positively impacted from period to period. The increased sales in these regions were partially offset by sales decreases in the U.K. and Iberia of 6% and 1%, respectively. Sales in the U.K. decreased from period to period primarily due to decreased distribution of our 1001 brand in the retail channel from period to period. Sales generated in Euro in the direct markets also resulted in slightly higher Pound Sterling sales in fiscal year 2016 due the strengthening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling from period to period. The average exchange rate for the Euro against the Pound Sterling increased from 0.7497 to 0.7637, or 2%. Also contributing to the overall sales increase in the direct markets were increased sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line of $1.9 million, or 45%, from period to period due to expanded distribution. Sales from direct markets accounted for 66% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 63% of the EMEA segment's sales for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nThe regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. Sales in the distributor markets decreased $2.8 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an 11% decrease in sales in Russia as a result of the unstable market conditions in Eastern Europe which started in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Although the market conditions in Russia have begun to stabilize, our sales have not returned to the levels that we experienced prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Sales were also negatively impacted in fiscal year 2016 by continued political and economic instability in other countries in the distributor markets. Since a high percentage of sales in the distributor markets in the EMEA segment are generated in U.S. Dollars, there were insignificant impacts due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. The distributor markets accounted for 34% of the EMEA segment's total sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, compared to 37% for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>47,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,639 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,936 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,320 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(384) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>54,038 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,959 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>79 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region remained constant at $54.0 million for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

Although sales in China remained relatively constant at $13.3 million and $13.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in China. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 7% from period to period primarily due to increased distribution, particularly in Southern China.\n\ufeff\nSales in Australia decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on Australia sales. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 7% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased distribution and higher sales levels resulting from successful promotional programs as well as continued growth of our base business.\n\ufeff\nGross Profit\n\ufeff\nGross profit increased to $214.4 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to $200.2 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 56.3% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 52.9% for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nGross margin was positively impacted by 2.4 percentage points from period to period due to favorable net changes in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans in all three segments. There is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles. The average cost of crude oil which flowed through our cost of goods sold was significantly lower in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, thus resulting in positive impacts to our gross margin from period to period. Due to the volatility of the price of crude oil, it is uncertain whether we will realize the same level of benefit in our gross margin related to it in future periods. The combined effects of favorable sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs positively impacted gross margin by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix as a result of a higher portion of sales in the Americas segment being made of higher margin maintenance products from period to period. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 0.2 percentage points from period to period primarily due to sales price increases implemented in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific segments over the last twelve months. In addition, advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers decreased from period to period positively impacting gross margin by 0.1 percentage points. In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. The costs associated with certain promotional activities are recorded as a reduction to sales while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses.\n\ufeff\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted gross margin by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling in our EMEA segment from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The combined effect of the strengthening of both the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period caused an increase in our Pound Sterling sales, resulting in favorable impacts to the gross margin. These favorable impacts to gross margin were slightly offset by 0.1 percentage points due to higher warehousing and in-bound freight costs, particularly in the Americas segment from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNote that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $16.1 million and $15.8 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 increased $8.9 million to $117.8 million from $108.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 30.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 from 28.8% for the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, increased freight costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Employee-related costs, which include salaries, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock-based compensation and other fringe benefits, increased by $11.5 million. This increase was primarily due to higher accruals for earned incentive compensation from period to period as well as annual compensation increases, which take effect in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and increased headcount. Freight costs associated with shipping products to our customers increased $1.0 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in the EMEA segment from period to period as well as additional costs associated with the shift in the distribution model in the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGermanics region in EMEA. Other miscellaneous expenses, which primarily include sales commissions and depreciation expense, increased by $0.8 million period over period. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $4.4 million on SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 were $7.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively.

This team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Expenses\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 decreased $0.6 million to $22.3 million from $22.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 5.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 from 6.0% for the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on such expenses of $0.9 million from period to period. Thus, on a constant currency basis, advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year 2016 would have increased by $0.3 million, primarily due to a higher level of promotional programs and marketing support in the EMEA segment from period to period. Investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year 2017 is expected to be close to 6.0% of net sales.\n\ufeff\nAs a percentage of net sales, advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were $16.1 million and $16.0 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled $38.4 million and $38.9 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of Definite-lived Intangible Assets Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization of our definite-lived intangible assets remained constant at $3.0 million for both the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\ufeff\nIncome from Operations by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes income from operations by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>48,404 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,674 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>31,702 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30,173 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,529 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,162 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,602 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,560 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnallocated corporate (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(23,920) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(24,059) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>139 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>71,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>65,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,958 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 33: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments.

As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Americas segment increased from 52.6% to 55.1% period over period. This\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincrease in the gross margin was primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as favorable sales mix changes, which were slightly offset by increased warehousing and in-house freight costs from period to period. The higher level of sales from period to period was accompanied by a $5.1 million increase in operating expenses, most of which related to increased headcount and higher earned incentive compensation expenses period over period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 24.9% to 25.3% period over period.\n\ufeff\nEMEA\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the EMEA segment increased to $31.7 million, up $1.5 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher gross margin, which was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in sales and higher operating expenses. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the EMEA segment increased from 54.6% to 58.7% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as sales price increases. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also had a significant favorable impact on gross margin from period to period. Operating expenses increased $3.1 million mainly related to higher earned incentive compensation expenses period over period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 22.0% to 27.0% period over period.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to $15.2 million, up $2.6 million, or 20%, the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Asia-Pacific segment increased from 49.9% to 54.8% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, sales price increases, and a lower level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we gave to our customers from period to period. Also contributing to the increased gross margin from period to period was the write-off of product and other costs related to a quality issue that occurred during fiscal year 2015 in the Asia distributor markets.

4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nSales of maintenance products in the Americas segment increased $7.0 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of WD-40 maintenance products in Latin America and the U.S., which were up 7% and 5%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nyear 2014. The increase in Latin America was primarily due to new distribution and successful promotional programs that were conducted during fiscal year 2015 throughout the Latin America region, particularly those in Brazil and Mexico. The sales increase in the U.S. from period to period was primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities and increased distribution for the WD-40 multi-use product. Sales in the U.S. were also positively impacted from period to period due to the launch of our new innovative WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw product in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. These sales increases in Latin America and the U.S. were slightly offset by a sales decrease of 3% for maintenance products in Canada, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In functional currency, which is the Canadian Dollar, sales of maintenance products in Canada increased by 8% from period to period. Also contributing to the overall sales increase of the maintenance products in the Americas segment from period to period were higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, which were up $2.3 million, or 26%, due to increased promotional activities and new distribution during fiscal year 2015.\n\ufeff\nSales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment decreased $0.5 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. While total sales of homecare and cleaning products in the U.S., which is where the majority of such sales originate, remained relatively constant from period to period, sales of such products decreased in Canada for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. In Canada, sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased 22% driven primarily by the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period and lower sales of 2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners and Spot Shot, which were down 24% and 19%, respectively, for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. In functional currency, sales of homecare and cleaning products in Canada decreased by 13% from period to period. While each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows, we have continued to experience decreased or flat sales for many of these products primarily due to lost distribution, reduced product offerings, competition, category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers, particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels.\n\ufeff\nFor the Americas segment, 82% of sales came from the U.S., and 18% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to the distribution for fiscal year 2014 when 81% of sales came from the U.S., and 19% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined.\nEMEA\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\ufeff\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>144,255 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(14,525) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,117 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,113 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>136,847 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>151,368 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(14,521) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>40% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 39: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWhile the Company's reporting currency is U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling. Although the functional currency of this subsidiary is Pound Sterling, approximately 45% of its sales are generated in Euro and 25% are generated in U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Pound Sterling sales and earnings for the EMEA segment can be negatively or positively impacted from period to period upon translation from these currencies depending on whether the Euro and U.S. Dollar are weakening or strengthening against the Pound Sterling.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nSales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $136.9 million, down $14.5 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 had an unfavorable impact on sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 translated at the exchange rates in effect for fiscal year 2014 would have been $144.3 million in the EMEA segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have decreased by $7.1 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nThe countries in Europe where we sell through a direct sales force include the U.K., Italy, France, Iberia (which includes Spain and Portugal) and the Germanics sales region (which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands). Overall, sales from direct markets decreased $6.6 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. We experienced sales decreases throughout most of the Europe direct markets for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, with percentage decreases in sales as follows: Italy, 23%; the Germanics region, 12%; Iberia, 8%; and France, 7%. The decreased sales in these regions were slightly offset by the sales increase of 3%\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin the U.K. from period to period. The overall sales decline was primarily due to the continued weakening of the Euro, the currency in which a substantial portion of the direct markets sales are generated, relative to the Pound Sterling from period to period. The average exchange rate for the Euro against the Pound Sterling decreased by 9% to 0.7497 during fiscal year 2015 from 0.8265 for fiscal year 2014. As a result of this change in the foreign currency exchange rates, our sales in the direct markets decreased from period to period in Pound Sterling. Although sales in the direct markets decreased from period to period, sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line increased $0.9 million, or 26%, due to expanded distribution of the product line in fiscal year 2015. Sales from direct markets accounted for 63% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 62% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nThe regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. Sales in the distributor markets decreased $7.9 million, or 14%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a significant decrease in sales in Russia and Ukraine as a result of the political and economic instability in Eastern Europe. Sales to Russia and Ukraine decreased by approximately 30% and 77%, respectively, from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015. Sales also decreased in the Middle East from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to lower sales of the WD-40 multi-use product in Afghanistan. These overall sales decreases were slightly offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period, which increased sales, and higher sales volume of WD-40 multi-use product in Northern Europe due to the continued growth of our base business. The distributor markets accounted for 37% of the total EMEA segment sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, compared to 38% for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,639 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>43,670 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,969 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,320 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,153 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>167 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,959 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>50,823 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,136 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region increased to $54.0 million, up $3.1 million, or 6% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 had an unfavorable impact on sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 translated at the exchange rates in effect for fiscal year 2014 would have been $56.1 million in the Asia-Pacific segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $5.3 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nSales in Asia, which represented 68% of the total sales in the Asia-Pacific segment, increased $3.6 million, or 11%, for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Sales in the Asia distributor markets increased $2.4 million, or 11%, from period to period primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 multi-use product throughout most of the distributor markets, including those in South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia. Sales in China increased $1.2 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to new distribution, much of which came from Southern China, and increased promotional activities from period to period.\n\ufeff\nSales in Australia decreased by $0.5 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on Australia sales. In functional currency, which is the Australian Dollar, sales increased by 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased distribution and promotional activities from period to period as well as a price increase which was implemented at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGross Profit\n\ufeff\nGross profit increased to $200.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to $198.9 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 52.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 51.9% for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nGross margin was positively impacted by 1.6 percentage points from period to period due to favorable net changes in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans in all three segments. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 0.3 percentage points from period to period due to sales price increases. These sales price increases were implemented in certain locations and markets in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA segments over the last twelve months of fiscal year 2015. In addition, gross margin was positively impacted by 0.1 percentage points from period to period due to lower warehousing and in-bound freight costs, particularly in the Americas segment.\n\ufeff\nThese favorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by 0.3 percentage points due to a higher level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers from period to period. The increase in such discounts was due to a higher percentage of sales being subject to promotional allowances during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily in the Asia-Pacific and Americas segments. In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. The costs associated with certain promotional activities are recorded as a reduction to sales while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted gross margin by 0.5 percentage points primarily due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling in our EMEA segment from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The net effect of the general weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period caused a decrease in our sales, resulting in unfavorable impacts to the gross margin. The combined effects of unfavorable sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs also negatively impacted gross margin by 0.2 percentage points from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNote that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $15.8 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 increased $0.3 million to $108.9 million from $108.6 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 28.8% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 from 28.3% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, a higher level of expenses associated with travel and meetings, higher costs associated with new product exploration, and increased depreciation expense, from period to period. Employee-related costs, which include salaries, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock-based compensation and other fringe benefits, increased by $1.7 million from period to period primarily due to annual compensation increases, higher staffing levels and other employee-related costs we incurred associated with changes that we made to our WD-40 Bike business in the United States. These increases were partially offset by lower earned incentive compensation, from period to period. Travel and meeting expenses increased $0.8 million due to a higher level of travel expenses associated with various sales meetings and activities in support of our strategic initiatives. The $0.8 million increase in new product exploration expenses, which are included in research and development costs, was primarily due to an increased level of spending during fiscal year 2015 related to the continued development of our products within the WD-40 brand. Depreciation expense increased by $0.5 million from period to period primarily due to our continued investment in computer system related assets and other capital assets which support our general business operations. Other miscellaneous expenses, which primarily include general office overhead, sales commission, and insurance costs, also increased by $0.5 million period over period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in professional services costs from period to period, primarily due to lower legal fees associated with litigation activities and general consulting services in our Americas and EMEA segments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $2.6 million on SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nWe continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014 were $9.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Our research and development team engages in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconsumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. This team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Expenses\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 decreased $1.0 million, or 4%, to $22.9 million from $23.9 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 6.0% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 from 6.2% for fiscal year 2014. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expenses was primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in the EMEA segment from period to period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were $16.0 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled $38.9 million and $40.1 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of Definite-lived Intangible Assets Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization of our definite-lived intangible assets was $3.0 million and $2.6 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This $0.4 million increase from period to period was primarily due to the GT85 Limited acquisition, which we completed in September 2014.\n\ufeff\nIncome from Operations by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes income from operations by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,674 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>41,356 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,318 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30,173 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34,003 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3,830) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(11)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,602 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10,364 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,238 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnallocated corporate (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(24,059) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(21,986) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,073) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>65,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>63,737 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,653 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments.

As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Americas segment increased from 51.0% to 52.6% period over period. This increase in the gross margin was primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as decreased warehousing and in-bound freight costs from period to period. The higher level of sales from period to period in the Americas segment was accompanied by a $1.0 million increase in total operating expenses.

As a percentage of net sales,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngross profit for the EMEA segment increased from 54.0% to 54.6% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans and price increases, both of which were significantly offset by the unfavorable impacts of changes in sales mix and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and U.S. Dollar. The net effects of the continued weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period has caused our sales to decrease, resulting in unfavorable impacts to the gross margin. The lower level of sales was accompanied by a $3.2 million decrease in total operating expenses driven mainly by lower advertising and sales promotion expenses, freight costs and earned incentive compensation. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 22.5% to 22.0% period over period.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to $12.6 million, up $2.2 million, or 22%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in sales and a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Asia-Pacific segment increased from 48.9% to 49.9% from period to period due to the combined positive impacts of sales price increases and decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, both of which were partially offset by a higher level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we gave to our customers from period to period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 20.4% to 23.4% period over period.\n\ufeff\nNon-Operating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations (in thousands):\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>584 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>596 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(12) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,205 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>203 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,659 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>372 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,287 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,303 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>19,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(910) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\n\ufeff\nInterest income remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense increased $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a higher outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility period over period.\n\ufeff\nOther Expense\n\ufeff\nOther expense increased by $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net foreign currency exchange losses from period to period as a result of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe provision for income taxes was 29.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 30.5% for fiscal year 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily attributable to an increase in the taxable income in the U.K., which is taxed at lower statutory income tax rates.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nNet income was $44.8 million, or $3.04 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2015 compared to $43.7 million, or $2.87 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had an unfavorable impact of $1.7 million on net income for fiscal year 2015. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income for fiscal year 2015 would have been $46.5 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPerformance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n\ufeff\nIn managing our business operations and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with certain non-GAAP performance measures. These performance measures are part of our current 55/30/25 business model, which includes gross margin, cost of doing business, and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), the latter two of which are non-GAAP performance measures. Cost of doing business is defined as total operating expenses less amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, impairment charges related to intangible assets and depreciation in operating departments, and EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we changed to this new 55/30/25 business model from our previous 50/30/20 business model. This means that we now target our gross margin to be 55% of net sales, our cost of doing business to be 30% of net sales, and our EBITDA to be 25% of net sales. Results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors, including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future such as those related to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard our WD-40 brand. The targets for these performance measures are long-term in nature, particularly those for cost of doing business and EBITDA, and we expect to make progress towards achieving them over time as our revenues increase.\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes the results of these performance measures:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>56% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>53% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>52% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of doing business as a percentage of net sales - non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDA as a percentage of net sales - non-GAAP (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentages may not aggregate to EBITDA percentage due to rounding and because amounts recorded in other income (expense), net on the Company's consolidated statement of operations are not included as an adjustment to earnings in the EBITDA calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nWe use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative performance of the Company from period to period.

Net cash provided by operations was $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015. We believe we continue to be well positioned to weather any uncertainty in the capital markets and global economy due to our strong balance sheet and efficient business model, along with our growing and diversified global revenues. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth.\n\ufeff\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations and cash currently available from our existing $175.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America\u201d), which expires on May 13, 2020. To date, we have used the proceeds of the revolving credit facility for our stock repurchases and plan to continue using such proceeds for our general working capital needs and stock repurchases under our board approved share buy-back plan. The Company also utilized this revolving credit facility in September 2016 to fund the purchase of its new headquarters office, which will house both corporate employees and employees in the Company's Americas segment. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we had net new borrowings of $14.0 million U.S. dollars under the revolving credit facility. We regularly convert existing draws on our line of credit to new draws with new maturity dates and interest rates. As of August 31, 2016, we had a $122.0 million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, all of which was classified as long-term, and there were no other letters of credit outstanding or restrictions on the amount available on this line of credit. Per the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement, our consolidated leverage ratio cannot be greater than three to one and our consolidated interest coverage ratio cannot be less than three to one. See Note 7 - Debt for additional information on these financial covenants. At August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants as required by the revolving credit facility and believe it is unlikely we will fail to comply with any of these covenants over the next twelve months. We would need to have a significant decrease in sales and/or a significant increase in expenses in order for us to not comply with the debt covenants.\n\ufeff\nAt August 31, 2016, we had a total of $108.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Of this balance, $102.2 million was held in Europe, Australia and China in foreign currencies. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management determined that it would undertake, in fiscal year 2017, a one-time repatriation of $8.2 million, which represents all of the historical foreign earnings from its Australia subsidiary and 90% of the historical foreign earnings from its China subsidiary. Management determined that such a foreign distribution was prudent due to the current favorable tax consequences of such a distribution, stemming principally from the recent significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various currencies in which the Company conducts business. Accordingly, we determined that we were no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to this amount of unremitted earnings and recorded the impact of this decision in the 2016 income tax provision, which resulted in the recognition of an incremental immaterial tax benefit. It is the Company's current intention to indefinitely reinvest any future foreign earnings of its Australia and China subsidiaries. However, management will make such determination based on an evaluation of facts and circumstances at each future reporting date.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our future cash from domestic operations, together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund both short-term and long-term operating requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions and new business development activities in the United States.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlthough we hold a significant amount of cash outside of the United States and the draws on the credit facility to date have been made by our entity in the United States, we do not foresee any ongoing issues with repaying or refinancing these loans with domestically generated funds since we closely monitor the use of this credit facility. In the event that management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate additional foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., we would be required to record additional tax expense at the time when we determine that such foreign earnings are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of August 31, 2016, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on $113.4 million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, mostly attributable to the U.K., since these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2016, the liquidity provided by our $175.0 million revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected consolidated operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including: future debt, principal and interest payments, future capital expenditure requirements, future share repurchases, future dividend payments (which are determined on a quarterly basis by the Company's Board of Directors), alternative investment opportunities, debt covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>60,604 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>55,064 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>38,730 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(20,920) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(16,951) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(10,503) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38,536) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38,663) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(25,842) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,153) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3,357) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,984 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(3,005) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(3,907) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,369 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5.5 million to $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 from $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was net income of $52.6 million, which increased $7.8 million from period to period. This increase was slightly offset by changes in our working capital, which were primarily attributable to an overall increase in the trade accounts receivable balance due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and the timing of payments received from our customers from period to period. Also contributing to the change in working capital from period to period were lower earned incentive payouts in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as well as significantly higher accruals for earned incentive compensation in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior year period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $16.4 million to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015 from $38.7 million for fiscal year 2014. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 was net income of $44.8 million. The changes in our working capital from period to period were primarily attributable to an overall decrease in the trade accounts receivable balance due to decreased sales volumes and the timing of payments received from our customers from period to period. In addition, the net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the overall decrease in inventory levels due to the timing of our inventory purchases from period to period. Also contributing to the changes in working capital from period to period were lower earned incentive payouts and accruals in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The settlement of an insurance reimbursable item in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, and lower income taxes receivable balances also contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities from period to period.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $4.0 million to $20.9 million for fiscal year 2016 from $16.9 million for fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in net purchases of short-term investments that were made by our U.K. and Australia subsidiaries. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $4.1 million in cash outflow related to the GT85 Limited\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nacquisition which was completed by our U.K. subsidiary in early fiscal year 2015 and a $1.4 million decrease in capital expenditures from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $6.4 million to $16.9 million for fiscal year 2015 from $10.5 million for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a $4.1 million cash outflow related to the GT85 Limited acquisition which was completed by our U.K. subsidiary in September 2014. Of this $4.1 million purchase consideration, $3.7 million was paid in early fiscal year 2015 and the remaining balance was paid in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. Also contributing to the total cash outflows were a $2.9 million increase in purchases of short-term investments that were made by our U.K. and Australia subsidiaries, and a $1.7 million increase in capital expenditures from period to period. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in cash outflow related to the Belgium customer list which was acquired by our U.K. subsidiary for $1.8 million in fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $0.2 million to $38.5 million for fiscal year 2016 from $38.7 million for the fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a $4.0 million increase in cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which was almost completely offset by a $1.9 million increase in dividends paid and a $1.9 million increase in cash outflow for treasury stock purchases from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $12.9 million to $38.7 million for fiscal year 2015 from $25.8 million for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a $25.0 million decrease in cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by a $12.5 million decrease in treasury stock purchases. Dividends paid also increased by $1.5 million from period to period.\n\ufeff\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes\n\ufeff\nAll of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balance is denominated in these foreign functional currencies, particularly at our U.K. subsidiary which operates in Pound Sterling. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these functional currencies against the U.S. Dollar at the end of each reporting period. The net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, when expressed in U.S. Dollar terms, was a decrease in cash of $4.2 million and $3.4 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an increase in cash of $2.0 million for fiscal year 2014. These changes were primarily due to fluctuations in various foreign currency exchange rates from period to period, but the majority is related to the fluctuations in the Pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar.\n\ufeff\nShare Repurchase Plans\n\ufeff\nOn October 14, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, once the Company's previous $60.0 million plan was exhausted, the Company was authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2016. The timing and amount of repurchases were based on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto. During the period from March 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 503,127 shares at a total cost of $47.8 million under this $75.0 million plan.\n\ufeff\nOn June 21, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective on September 1, 2016 and will remain in effect through August 31, 2018, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto.\n\ufeff\nDividends\n\ufeff\nThe Company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared an 11% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend, increasing it from $0.38 per share to $0.42 per share. On October 11, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share payable on October 31, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 21, 2016. Our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of August 31, 2016 for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands).

Although we typically do not have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with our contract manufacturers, when such obligations have been included, they have been immaterial. In the ordinary course of business, we communicate supply needs to our contract manufacturers based on orders and short-term projections, ranging from two to five months. We are committed to purchase the products produced by the contract manufacturers based on the projections provided. Upon the termination of contracts with contract manufacturers, we obtain certain inventory control rights and are obligated to work with the contract manufacturer to sell through all product held by or manufactured by the contract manufacturer on our behalf during the termination notification period.

Based on our most recent cash projections and anticipated business activities, we expect to borrow additional amounts against this credit facility ranging from $20.0 million to $25.0 million in fiscal year 2017. We estimate that the interest associated with these borrowings will be approximately $0.6 million for fiscal year 2017 based on estimated applicable interest rates and the expected dates of future borrowings.

Preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions and these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report includes a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results may have varied from those reported had different assumptions been used or other conditions prevailed. Our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentives\n\ufeff\nSales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to our customer when risks of loss and title have passed. Sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns, sales incentives, trade promotions and cash discounts. For certain of our sales we must make judgments and certain assumptions in order to determine when delivery has occurred. Through an\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nanalysis of end-of-period shipments for these particular sales, we determine an average time of transit of product to our customers, and this is used to estimate the time of delivery and whether revenue should be recognized during the current reporting period for such shipments. Differences in judgments or estimates related to the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nSales incentives are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives include on-going trade promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require us to estimate and accrue for the expected costs of such programs. These programs include cooperative marketing programs, shelf price reductions, coupons, rebates, consideration and allowances given to retailers for shelf space and/or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activities. Costs related to these sales incentive programs, with the exception of coupon costs, are recorded as a reduction to sales upon delivery of products to customers. Coupon costs are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as a reduction to sales as incurred, which is when the coupons are circulated.\n\ufeff\nSales incentives are calculated based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities. The determination of sales incentive costs and the related liabilities require us to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns, status of trade promotion activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category. We review our assumptions and adjust our sales incentive allowances accordingly on a quarterly basis. Our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates. If our accrual estimates for sales incentives at August 31, 2016 were to differ by 10%, the impact on net sales would be approximately $0.7 million.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nCurrent income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition to valuation allowances, we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes. Amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\n\ufeff\nU.S. federal income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. We determine whether our foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely based on the capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries. We reassess this determination each reporting period. Changes to this determination may be warranted based on our experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances.\n\ufeff\nValuation of Goodwill\n\ufeff\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill, intangibles and other. We assess for possible impairments to goodwill at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist.\n\ufeff\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed at the reporting unit level as required by the authoritative guidance. In accordance with ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment\u201d, companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We performed a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. In performing this qualitative assessment, we assessed relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of each of our reporting units. Factors that were considered included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) macroeconomic conditions; (2) industry and market conditions; (3) historical financial performance and expected financial performance; (4) other entity specific events, such as changes in management or key personnel; and (5) events affecting the Company's reporting units, such as a change in the composition of net assets or any expected dispositions. Based on the results of this qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of our reporting units is less than its fair value and, thus, the two-step quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconcluded that no impairment of our goodwill existed as of February 29, 2016. We also did not identify or record any impairment losses related to our goodwill during our annual impairment tests performed in fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\n\ufeff\nWhile we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test and analyses are reasonable, actual events and results could differ substantially from those included in the calculation. In the event that business conditions change in the future, we may be required to reassess and update our forecasts and estimates used in subsequent goodwill impairment analyses. If the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, an impairment charge to our goodwill balances may result at that time.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, there were no indicators of impairment identified as a result of our review of events and circumstances related to our goodwill subsequent to February 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nWe assess for potential impairments to our long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and/or its estimated remaining useful life may no longer be appropriate. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing market participants and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to results of operations. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.\n\ufeff\nThere were no indicators of potential impairment identified as a result of the Company's review of events and circumstances related to its existing definite-lived intangible assets for the periods ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\ufeff\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\ufeff\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d. The amendments address eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d, which requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The updated guidance also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this updated guidance include changes to simplify the Codification for several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including those related to the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures, minimum statutory withholding requirements and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows. Certain of these changes are required to be applied retrospectively while other changes are required to be applied prospectively. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating whether it will adopt this updated guidance in fiscal year 2017 or in fiscal year 2018, as required, but it expects that the adoption of this new guidance will have a more than inconsequential impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, if the Company had adopted this updated guidance in fiscal year 2016, its income tax expense for the year would have been reduced by approximately $2.1 million due to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than through additional paid-in-capital. The Company also expects to change its policy related to forfeitures upon adoption of this new guidance such that it will recognize the impacts of forfeitures as they occur rather than recognizing them based on an estimated forfeiture rate. Although the Company is still assessing the impacts of this change in policy for forfeitures on its consolidated financial statements, it does not expect that the impact will be material.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLeases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d. The core principle of this updated guidance and related amendments is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new rule also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance was originally to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral for the effective date of this guidance. Early adoption is permitted but only to the original effective date. Companies are permitted to adopt this new rule following either a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company does not intend to adopt this guidance early and it will become effective for the Company on September 1, 2018. The Company has not yet decided which implementation method it will adopt. Although management has completed its initial evaluation of this new guidance as it pertains to the Company, it is still in the process of determining the impacts that this updated guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nRelated Parties\n\ufeff\nOn October 11, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors elected Mr. Gregory A. Sandfort as a director of WD-40 Company. Mr. Sandfort is the Chief Executive Officer of Tractor Supply Company ( Tractor Supply\u201d), which is a WD-40 Company customer that acquires products from the Company in the ordinary course of business.\n\ufeff\nThe consolidated financial statements include sales to Tractor Supply of $1.2 million and $1.1 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts receivable from Tractor Supply were not material as of August 31, 2016.\n\ufeff", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide the reader of the Company's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. This MD&A includes the following sections: Overview, Highlights, Results of Operations, Performance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Critical Accounting Policies, Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Related Parties. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 15 of this report.\n\ufeff\nIn order to show the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, we have included constant currency disclosures, where necessary, in the Overview and Results of Operations sections which follow. Constant currency disclosures represent the translation of our current fiscal year revenues and expenses from the functional currencies of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We use results on a constant currency basis as one of the measures to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Results on a constant currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( non-GAAP\u201d) and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOverview\n\ufeff\nThe Company\n\ufeff\nWD-40 Company ( the Company\u201d), based in San Diego, California, is a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products which solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world. We market our maintenance products and our homecare and cleaning products under the following well-known brands: WD-40\u00ae, 3-IN-ONE\u00ae, GT85\u00ae, X-14\u00ae, 2000 Flushes\u00ae, Carpet Fresh\u00ae, no vac\u00ae, Spot Shot\u00ae, 1001\u00ae, Lava\u00ae and Solvol\u00ae. Currently included in the WD-40 brand are the WD-40 multi-use product and the WD-40 Specialist\u00ae and WD-40 BIKE\u00ae product lines.\n\ufeff\nOur brands are sold in various locations around the world. Maintenance products are sold worldwide in markets throughout North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Homecare and cleaning products are sold primarily in North America, the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) and Australia. We sell our products primarily through mass retail and home center stores, warehouse club stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, sport retailers, independent bike dealers, online retailers and industrial distributors and suppliers.\nHighlights\n\ufeff\nThe following summarizes the financial and operational highlights for our business during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Consolidated net sales increased $2.5 million, or 1%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $15.2 million on consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2016. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by $17.7 million, or 5%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Of the $15.2 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, $11.3 million came from our EMEA segment, which accounted for 36% of our consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Consolidated net sales for the WD-40 Specialist product line were $21.5 million which is a 14% increase for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Although the WD-40 Specialist product line is expected to provide the Company with long-term growth opportunities, we will see some volatility in sales levels from period to period due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, and various other factors that come with building a new product line. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 56.3% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 52.9% for the prior fiscal year. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Consolidated net income increased $7.8 million, or 17%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $2.8 million on consolidated net income for fiscal year 2016. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by $10.6 million, or 24%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Diluted earnings per common share for fiscal year 2016 were $3.64 versus $3.04 in the prior fiscal year. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Share repurchases continued to be executed under our $75.0 million share buy-back plan, which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors in October 2014 and which expired on August 31, 2016. During the period from September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 317,084 shares at an average price of $101.31 per share, for a total cost of $32.1 million. \n\ufeff\nOur strategic initiatives and the areas where we will continue to focus our time, talent and resources in future periods include: (i) maximizing WD-40 multi-use product sales through geographic expansion and increased market penetration; (ii) leveraging the WD-40 brand by growing the WD-40 Specialist product line; (iii) leveraging the strengths of the Company through broadened product and revenue base; (iv) attracting, developing and retaining talented people; and (v) operating with excellence.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nFiscal Year Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal

This sales increase was mainly driven by higher sales of maintenance products in the U.S. and Latin America, which increased 6% and 3%, respectively, from period to period. The sales increase in the U.S. was primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities for all maintenance products and the added distribution of our new WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw product. The sales increase in Latin America was primarily due to the success of certain promotional programs which were conducted in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, primarily those in Mexico and Chile, as well as the continued growth of the WD-40 multi-use product throughout the Latin America region. The sales increases in the U.S. and Latin America were partially offset by a sales decrease in Canada of 14%, from period to period. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales associated with promotional programs, most of which was driven by unstable market and economic conditions, particularly in the industrial channel in Western Canada as a result of reduced activity in the oil industry. In addition, sales in Canada were negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates form period to period. Also contributing to the overall sales increase of maintenance products in the Americas segment was higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, which were up $1.1 million, or 10%, from period to period due to new distribution, particularly of certain new products within this product line during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.\n\ufeff\nSales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment decreased $2.6 million, or 9%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This sales decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Spot Shot carpet stain remover and 2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners, most of which is related to the U.S., of 13% and 7%, respectively. While each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows, we have continued to experience decreased or flat sales for many of these products primarily due to lost distribution, reduced product offerings, competition, category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers, particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels. At August 31, 2016, the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets associated with the Company's trade names for the homecare and cleaning products was $16.8 million, of which $9.3 million and $4.3 million were associated with the Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes trade names, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFor the Americas segment, 83% of sales came from the U.S., and 17% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year when 82% of sales came from the U.S., and 18% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined.\nEMEA\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\ufeff\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,217 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(513) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,018 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,117 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,099) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(15)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>135,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>136,847 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,612) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n (1) While the Company's reporting currency is U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling. Although the functional currency of this subsidiary is Pound Sterling, approximately 45% of its sales are generated in Euro and 25% are generated in U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Pound Sterling sales and earnings for the EMEA segment can be negatively or positively impacted from period to period upon translation from these currencies depending on whether the Euro and U.S. Dollar are weakening or strengthening against the Pound Sterling. \n\ufeff\nSales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $135.2 million, down $1.6 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales for the EMEA segment from period to period. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 translated at the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year would have been $146.5 million in the EMEA segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $9.7 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe countries in EMEA where we sell through a direct sales force include the U.K., Italy, France, Iberia (which includes Spain and Portugal) and the Germanics sales region (which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands). Overall, sales from direct markets increased $1.2 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the direct markets in EMEA from period to period. On a constant currency basis, sales in the direct markets would have increased by 10% from fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe experienced sales increases throughout most of the EMEA direct markets for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, with percentage increases in sales as follows: the Germanics region, 10%; Italy, 9%; and France, 1%. Sales increases in these direct markets were primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 multi-use product, particularly in the Germanics region. Sales in the Germanics increased from period to period due to a change in the distribution model for the do-it-yourself (DIY) channel that we made for this region in fiscal year 2015. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from a distribution model for this channel where we sold product through a large wholesale customer who then supplied various retail customers to one where we sell direct to these retail customers. Due to the successful build of our direct customer base in this new model in fiscal year 2016, sales in this region were positively impacted from period to period. The increased sales in these regions were partially offset by sales decreases in the U.K. and Iberia of 6% and 1%, respectively. Sales in the U.K. decreased from period to period primarily due to decreased distribution of our 1001 brand in the retail channel from period to period. Sales generated in Euro in the direct markets also resulted in slightly higher Pound Sterling sales in fiscal year 2016 due the strengthening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling from period to period. The average exchange rate for the Euro against the Pound Sterling increased from 0.7497 to 0.7637, or 2%. Also contributing to the overall sales increase in the direct markets were increased sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line of $1.9 million, or 45%, from period to period due to expanded distribution. Sales from direct markets accounted for 66% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 63% of the EMEA segment's sales for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nThe regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. Sales in the distributor markets decreased $2.8 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an 11% decrease in sales in Russia as a result of the unstable market conditions in Eastern Europe which started in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Although the market conditions in Russia have begun to stabilize, our sales have not returned to the levels that we experienced prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Sales were also negatively impacted in fiscal year 2016 by continued political and economic instability in other countries in the distributor markets. Since a high percentage of sales in the distributor markets in the EMEA segment are generated in U.S. Dollars, there were insignificant impacts due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. The distributor markets accounted for 34% of the EMEA segment's total sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, compared to 37% for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>47,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,639 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,936 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,320 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(384) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>54,038 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,959 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>79 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region remained constant at $54.0 million for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

Although sales in China remained relatively constant at $13.3 million and $13.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in China.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on Australia sales. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 7% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased distribution and higher sales levels resulting from successful promotional programs as well as continued growth of our base business.\n\ufeff\nGross Profit\n\ufeff\nGross profit increased to $214.4 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to $200.2 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 56.3% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 52.9% for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nGross margin was positively impacted by 2.4 percentage points from period to period due to favorable net changes in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans in all three segments. There is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles. The average cost of crude oil which flowed through our cost of goods sold was significantly lower in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, thus resulting in positive impacts to our gross margin from period to period. Due to the volatility of the price of crude oil, it is uncertain whether we will realize the same level of benefit in our gross margin related to it in future periods. The combined effects of favorable sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs positively impacted gross margin by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix as a result of a higher portion of sales in the Americas segment being made of higher margin maintenance products from period to period. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 0.2 percentage points from period to period primarily due to sales price increases implemented in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific segments over the last twelve months. In addition, advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers decreased from period to period positively impacting gross margin by 0.1 percentage points. In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. The costs associated with certain promotional activities are recorded as a reduction to sales while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses.\n\ufeff\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted gross margin by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling in our EMEA segment from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The combined effect of the strengthening of both the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period caused an increase in our Pound Sterling sales, resulting in favorable impacts to the gross margin. These favorable impacts to gross margin were slightly offset by 0.1 percentage points due to higher warehousing and in-bound freight costs, particularly in the Americas segment from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNote that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $16.1 million and $15.8 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 increased $8.9 million to $117.8 million from $108.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 30.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 from 28.8% for the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, increased freight costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Employee-related costs, which include salaries, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock-based compensation and other fringe benefits, increased by $11.5 million. This increase was primarily due to higher accruals for earned incentive compensation from period to period as well as annual compensation increases, which take effect in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and increased headcount. Freight costs associated with shipping products to our customers increased $1.0 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in the EMEA segment from period to period as well as additional costs associated with the shift in the distribution model in the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGermanics region in EMEA. Other miscellaneous expenses, which primarily include sales commissions and depreciation expense, increased by $0.8 million period over period. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $4.4 million on SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 were $7.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively. Our research and development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. This team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Expenses\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 decreased $0.6 million to $22.3 million from $22.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 5.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 from 6.0% for the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on such expenses of $0.9 million from period to period. Thus, on a constant currency basis, advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year 2016 would have increased by $0.3 million, primarily due to a higher level of promotional programs and marketing support in the EMEA segment from period to period. Investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year 2017 is expected to be close to 6.0% of net sales.\n\ufeff\nAs a percentage of net sales, advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were $16.1 million and $16.0 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled $38.4 million and $38.9 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of Definite-lived Intangible Assets Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization of our definite-lived intangible assets remained constant at $3.0 million for both the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\ufeff\nIncome from Operations by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes income from operations by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>48,404 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,674 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>31,702 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30,173 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,529 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,162 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,602 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,560 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnallocated corporate (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(23,920) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(24,059) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>139 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>71,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>65,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,958 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n (1) Unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments.

As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Americas segment increased from 52.6% to 55.1% period over period. This\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincrease in the gross margin was primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as favorable sales mix changes, which were slightly offset by increased warehousing and in-house freight costs from period to period. The higher level of sales from period to period was accompanied by a $5.1 million increase in operating expenses, most of which related to increased headcount and higher earned incentive compensation expenses period over period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 24.9% to 25.3% period over period.\n\ufeff\nEMEA\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the EMEA segment increased to $31.7 million, up $1.5 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher gross margin, which was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in sales and higher operating expenses. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the EMEA segment increased from 54.6% to 58.7% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as sales price increases. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also had a significant favorable impact on gross margin from period to period. Operating expenses increased $3.1 million mainly related to higher earned incentive compensation expenses period over period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 22.0% to 27.0% period over period.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to $15.2 million, up $2.6 million, or 20%, the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Asia-Pacific segment increased from 49.9% to 54.8% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, sales price increases, and a lower level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we gave to our customers from period to period. Also contributing to the increased gross margin from period to period was the write-off of product and other costs related to a quality issue that occurred during fiscal year 2015 in the Asia distributor markets. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 23.4% to 28.1% period over period.\n\ufeff\nNon-Operating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations (in thousands):\n\ufeff\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>683 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>584 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>99 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,703 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,205 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>498 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,461 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,659) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,120 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,161 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,303 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,858 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\n\ufeff\nInterest income remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher interest rates and an increased outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility period over period.\n\ufeff\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net changed by $4.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to net foreign currency exchange gains which were recorded for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to net foreign currency exchange losses which were recorded in the prior fiscal year as a result of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for both the Euro and the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe provision for income taxes was 27.7% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 29.0% for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was driven by an increase in the portion of taxable earnings attributable to foreign operations, particularly those in the U.K., which are taxed at lower tax rates.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nNet income was $52.6 million, or $3.64 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2016 compared to $44.8 million, or $3.04 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for the prior fiscal year.

4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nSales of maintenance products in the Americas segment increased $7.0 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of WD-40 maintenance products in Latin America and the U.S., which were up 7% and 5%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nyear 2014. The increase in Latin America was primarily due to new distribution and successful promotional programs that were conducted during fiscal year 2015 throughout the Latin America region, particularly those in Brazil and Mexico. The sales increase in the U.S. from period to period was primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities and increased distribution for the WD-40 multi-use product. Sales in the U.S. were also positively impacted from period to period due to the launch of our new innovative WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw product in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. These sales increases in Latin America and the U.S. were slightly offset by a sales decrease of 3% for maintenance products in Canada, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In functional currency, which is the Canadian Dollar, sales of maintenance products in Canada increased by 8% from period to period. Also contributing to the overall sales increase of the maintenance products in the Americas segment from period to period were higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, which were up $2.3 million, or 26%, due to increased promotional activities and new distribution during fiscal year 2015.\n\ufeff\nSales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment decreased $0.5 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. While total sales of homecare and cleaning products in the U.S., which is where the majority of such sales originate, remained relatively constant from period to period, sales of such products decreased in Canada for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. In Canada, sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased 22% driven primarily by the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period and lower sales of 2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners and Spot Shot, which were down 24% and 19%, respectively, for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. In functional currency, sales of homecare and cleaning products in Canada decreased by 13% from period to period. While each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows, we have continued to experience decreased or flat sales for many of these products primarily due to lost distribution, reduced product offerings, competition, category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers, particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels.\n\ufeff\nFor the Americas segment, 82% of sales came from the U.S., and 18% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to the distribution for fiscal year 2014 when 81% of sales came from the U.S., and 19% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined.\nEMEA\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\ufeff\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>144,255 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(14,525) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,117 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,113 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>136,847 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>151,368 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(14,521) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>40% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n (1) While the Company's reporting currency is U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling. Although the functional currency of this subsidiary is Pound Sterling, approximately 45% of its sales are generated in Euro and 25% are generated in U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Pound Sterling sales and earnings for the EMEA segment can be negatively or positively impacted from period to period upon translation from these currencies depending on whether the Euro and U.S. Dollar are weakening or strengthening against the Pound Sterling. \n\ufeff\nSales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $136.9 million, down $14.5 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 had an unfavorable impact on sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 translated at the exchange rates in effect for fiscal year 2014 would have been $144.3 million in the EMEA segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have decreased by $7.1 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nThe countries in Europe where we sell through a direct sales force include the U.K., Italy, France, Iberia (which includes Spain and Portugal) and the Germanics sales region (which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands). Overall, sales from direct markets decreased $6.6 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. We experienced sales decreases throughout most of the Europe direct markets for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, with percentage decreases in sales as follows: Italy, 23%; the Germanics region, 12%; Iberia, 8%; and France, 7%. The decreased sales in these regions were slightly offset by the sales increase of 3%\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin the U.K. from period to period. The overall sales decline was primarily due to the continued weakening of the Euro, the currency in which a substantial portion of the direct markets sales are generated, relative to the Pound Sterling from period to period. The average exchange rate for the Euro against the Pound Sterling decreased by 9% to 0.7497 during fiscal year 2015 from 0.8265 for fiscal year 2014. As a result of this change in the foreign currency exchange rates, our sales in the direct markets decreased from period to period in Pound Sterling. Although sales in the direct markets decreased from period to period, sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line increased $0.9 million, or 26%, due to expanded distribution of the product line in fiscal year 2015. Sales from direct markets accounted for 63% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 62% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nThe regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. Sales in the distributor markets decreased $7.9 million, or 14%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a significant decrease in sales in Russia and Ukraine as a result of the political and economic instability in Eastern Europe. Sales to Russia and Ukraine decreased by approximately 30% and 77%, respectively, from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015. Sales also decreased in the Middle East from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to lower sales of the WD-40 multi-use product in Afghanistan. These overall sales decreases were slightly offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period, which increased sales, and higher sales volume of WD-40 multi-use product in Northern Europe due to the continued growth of our base business. The distributor markets accounted for 37% of the total EMEA segment sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, compared to 38% for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance products\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,639 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>43,670 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,969 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomecare and cleaning products\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,320 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,153 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>167 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,959 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>50,823 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,136 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region increased to $54.0 million, up $3.1 million, or 6% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 had an unfavorable impact on sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 translated at the exchange rates in effect for fiscal year 2014 would have been $56.1 million in the Asia-Pacific segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $5.3 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nSales in Asia, which represented 68% of the total sales in the Asia-Pacific segment, increased $3.6 million, or 11%, for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Sales in the Asia distributor markets increased $2.4 million, or 11%, from period to period primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 multi-use product throughout most of the distributor markets, including those in South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia. Sales in China increased $1.2 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to new distribution, much of which came from Southern China, and increased promotional activities from period to period.\n\ufeff\nSales in Australia decreased by $0.5 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on Australia sales. In functional currency, which is the Australian Dollar, sales increased by 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased distribution and promotional activities from period to period as well as a price increase which was implemented at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGross Profit\n\ufeff\nGross profit increased to $200.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to $198.9 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 52.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 51.9% for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nGross margin was positively impacted by 1.6 percentage points from period to period due to favorable net changes in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans in all three segments. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 0.3 percentage points from period to period due to sales price increases. These sales price increases were implemented in certain locations and markets in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA segments over the last twelve months of fiscal year 2015. In addition, gross margin was positively impacted by 0.1 percentage points from period to period due to lower warehousing and in-bound freight costs, particularly in the Americas segment.\n\ufeff\nThese favorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by 0.3 percentage points due to a higher level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers from period to period. The increase in such discounts was due to a higher percentage of sales being subject to promotional allowances during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily in the Asia-Pacific and Americas segments. In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. The costs associated with certain promotional activities are recorded as a reduction to sales while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted gross margin by 0.5 percentage points primarily due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling in our EMEA segment from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The net effect of the general weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period caused a decrease in our sales, resulting in unfavorable impacts to the gross margin. The combined effects of unfavorable sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs also negatively impacted gross margin by 0.2 percentage points from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNote that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $15.8 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 increased $0.3 million to $108.9 million from $108.6 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 28.8% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 from 28.3% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, a higher level of expenses associated with travel and meetings, higher costs associated with new product exploration, and increased depreciation expense, from period to period. Employee-related costs, which include salaries, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock-based compensation and other fringe benefits, increased by $1.7 million from period to period primarily due to annual compensation increases, higher staffing levels and other employee-related costs we incurred associated with changes that we made to our WD-40 Bike business in the United States. These increases were partially offset by lower earned incentive compensation, from period to period. Travel and meeting expenses increased $0.8 million due to a higher level of travel expenses associated with various sales meetings and activities in support of our strategic initiatives. The $0.8 million increase in new product exploration expenses, which are included in research and development costs, was primarily due to an increased level of spending during fiscal year 2015 related to the continued development of our products within the WD-40 brand. Depreciation expense increased by $0.5 million from period to period primarily due to our continued investment in computer system related assets and other capital assets which support our general business operations. Other miscellaneous expenses, which primarily include general office overhead, sales commission, and insurance costs, also increased by $0.5 million period over period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in professional services costs from period to period, primarily due to lower legal fees associated with litigation activities and general consulting services in our Americas and EMEA segments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $2.6 million on SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nWe continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014 were $9.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Our research and development team engages in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconsumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. This team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Expenses\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 decreased $1.0 million, or 4%, to $22.9 million from $23.9 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 6.0% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 from 6.2% for fiscal year 2014. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expenses was primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in the EMEA segment from period to period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were $16.0 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled $38.9 million and $40.1 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of Definite-lived Intangible Assets Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization of our definite-lived intangible assets was $3.0 million and $2.6 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This $0.4 million increase from period to period was primarily due to the GT85 Limited acquisition, which we completed in September 2014.\n\ufeff\nIncome from Operations by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes income from operations by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange from\nPrior Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>46,674 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>41,356 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,318 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30,173 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34,003 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3,830) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(11)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,602 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10,364 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,238 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnallocated corporate (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(24,059) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(21,986) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,073) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>65,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>63,737 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,653 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments.

As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Americas segment increased from 51.0% to 52.6% period over period. This increase in the gross margin was primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as decreased warehousing and in-bound freight costs from period to period. The higher level of sales from period to period in the Americas segment was accompanied by a $1.0 million increase in total operating expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 22.9% to 24.9% period over period.\n\ufeff\nEMEA\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the EMEA segment decreased to $30.2 million, down $3.8 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a $14.5 million decrease in sales. As a percentage of net sales,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngross profit for the EMEA segment increased from 54.0% to 54.6% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans and price increases, both of which were significantly offset by the unfavorable impacts of changes in sales mix and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and U.S. Dollar. The net effects of the continued weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period has caused our sales to decrease, resulting in unfavorable impacts to the gross margin. The lower level of sales was accompanied by a $3.2 million decrease in total operating expenses driven mainly by lower advertising and sales promotion expenses, freight costs and earned incentive compensation. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 22.5% to 22.0% period over period.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to $12.6 million, up $2.2 million, or 22%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in sales and a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Asia-Pacific segment increased from 48.9% to 49.9% from period to period due to the combined positive impacts of sales price increases and decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, both of which were partially offset by a higher level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we gave to our customers from period to period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 20.4% to 23.4% period over period.\n\ufeff\nNon-Operating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations (in thousands):\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>584 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>596 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(12) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,205 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>203 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,659 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>372 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,287 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,303 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>19,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(910) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\n\ufeff\nInterest income remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense increased $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a higher outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility period over period.\n\ufeff\nOther Expense\n\ufeff\nOther expense increased by $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net foreign currency exchange losses from period to period as a result of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe provision for income taxes was 29.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 30.5% for fiscal year 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily attributable to an increase in the taxable income in the U.K., which is taxed at lower statutory income tax rates.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nNet income was $44.8 million, or $3.04 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2015 compared to $43.7 million, or $2.87 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had an unfavorable impact of $1.7 million on net income for fiscal year 2015. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income for fiscal year 2015 would have been $46.5 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPerformance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n\ufeff\nIn managing our business operations and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with certain non-GAAP performance measures. These performance measures are part of our current 55/30/25 business model, which includes gross margin, cost of doing business, and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), the latter two of which are non-GAAP performance measures. Cost of doing business is defined as total operating expenses less amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, impairment charges related to intangible assets and depreciation in operating departments, and EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we changed to this new 55/30/25 business model from our previous 50/30/20 business model. This means that we now target our gross margin to be 55% of net sales, our cost of doing business to be 30% of net sales, and our EBITDA to be 25% of net sales. Results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors, including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future such as those related to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard our WD-40 brand. The targets for these performance measures are long-term in nature, particularly those for cost of doing business and EBITDA, and we expect to make progress towards achieving them over time as our revenues increase.\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes the results of these performance measures:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>56% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>53% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>52% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of doing business as a percentage of net sales - non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDA as a percentage of net sales - non-GAAP (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Percentages may not aggregate to EBITDA percentage due to rounding and because amounts recorded in other income (expense), net on the Company's consolidated statement of operations are not included as an adjustment to earnings in the EBITDA calculation. \n\ufeff\nWe use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative performance of the Company from period to period.

Net cash provided by operations was $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015. We believe we continue to be well positioned to weather any uncertainty in the capital markets and global economy due to our strong balance sheet and efficient business model, along with our growing and diversified global revenues. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth.\n\ufeff\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations and cash currently available from our existing $175.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America\u201d), which expires on May 13, 2020. To date, we have used the proceeds of the revolving credit facility for our stock repurchases and plan to continue using such proceeds for our general working capital needs and stock repurchases under our board approved share buy-back plan. The Company also utilized this revolving credit facility in September 2016 to fund the purchase of its new headquarters office, which will house both corporate employees and employees in the Company's Americas segment. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we had net new borrowings of $14.0 million U.S. dollars under the revolving credit facility. We regularly convert existing draws on our line of credit to new draws with new maturity dates and interest rates. As of August 31, 2016, we had a $122.0 million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, all of which was classified as long-term, and there were no other letters of credit outstanding or restrictions on the amount available on this line of credit. Per the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement, our consolidated leverage ratio cannot be greater than three to one and our consolidated interest coverage ratio cannot be less than three to one. See Note 7 - Debt for additional information on these financial covenants. At August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants as required by the revolving credit facility and believe it is unlikely we will fail to comply with any of these covenants over the next twelve months. We would need to have a significant decrease in sales and/or a significant increase in expenses in order for us to not comply with the debt covenants.\n\ufeff\nAt August 31, 2016, we had a total of $108.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Of this balance, $102.2 million was held in Europe, Australia and China in foreign currencies. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management determined that it would undertake, in fiscal year 2017, a one-time repatriation of $8.2 million, which represents all of the historical foreign earnings from its Australia subsidiary and 90% of the historical foreign earnings from its China subsidiary. Management determined that such a foreign distribution was prudent due to the current favorable tax consequences of such a distribution, stemming principally from the recent significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various currencies in which the Company conducts business. Accordingly, we determined that we were no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to this amount of unremitted earnings and recorded the impact of this decision in the 2016 income tax provision, which resulted in the recognition of an incremental immaterial tax benefit. It is the Company's current intention to indefinitely reinvest any future foreign earnings of its Australia and China subsidiaries. However, management will make such determination based on an evaluation of facts and circumstances at each future reporting date.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our future cash from domestic operations, together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund both short-term and long-term operating requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions and new business development activities in the United States.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlthough we hold a significant amount of cash outside of the United States and the draws on the credit facility to date have been made by our entity in the United States, we do not foresee any ongoing issues with repaying or refinancing these loans with domestically generated funds since we closely monitor the use of this credit facility. In the event that management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate additional foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., we would be required to record additional tax expense at the time when we determine that such foreign earnings are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of August 31, 2016, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on $113.4 million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, mostly attributable to the U.K., since these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2016, the liquidity provided by our $175.0 million revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected consolidated operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including: future debt, principal and interest payments, future capital expenditure requirements, future share repurchases, future dividend payments (which are determined on a quarterly basis by the Company's Board of Directors), alternative investment opportunities, debt covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>60,604 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>55,064 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>38,730 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(20,920) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(16,951) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(10,503) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38,536) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38,663) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(25,842) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,153) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3,357) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,984 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(3,005) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(3,907) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,369 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5.5 million to $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 from $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was net income of $52.6 million, which increased $7.8 million from period to period. This increase was slightly offset by changes in our working capital, which were primarily attributable to an overall increase in the trade accounts receivable balance due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and the timing of payments received from our customers from period to period. Also contributing to the change in working capital from period to period were lower earned incentive payouts in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as well as significantly higher accruals for earned incentive compensation in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior year period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $16.4 million to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015 from $38.7 million for fiscal year 2014. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 was net income of $44.8 million. The changes in our working capital from period to period were primarily attributable to an overall decrease in the trade accounts receivable balance due to decreased sales volumes and the timing of payments received from our customers from period to period. In addition, the net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the overall decrease in inventory levels due to the timing of our inventory purchases from period to period. Also contributing to the changes in working capital from period to period were lower earned incentive payouts and accruals in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The settlement of an insurance reimbursable item in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, and lower income taxes receivable balances also contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities from period to period.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $4.0 million to $20.9 million for fiscal year 2016 from $16.9 million for fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in net purchases of short-term investments that were made by our U.K. and Australia subsidiaries. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $4.1 million in cash outflow related to the GT85 Limited\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nacquisition which was completed by our U.K. subsidiary in early fiscal year 2015 and a $1.4 million decrease in capital expenditures from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $6.4 million to $16.9 million for fiscal year 2015 from $10.5 million for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a $4.1 million cash outflow related to the GT85 Limited acquisition which was completed by our U.K. subsidiary in September 2014. Of this $4.1 million purchase consideration, $3.7 million was paid in early fiscal year 2015 and the remaining balance was paid in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. Also contributing to the total cash outflows were a $2.9 million increase in purchases of short-term investments that were made by our U.K. and Australia subsidiaries, and a $1.7 million increase in capital expenditures from period to period. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in cash outflow related to the Belgium customer list which was acquired by our U.K. subsidiary for $1.8 million in fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $0.2 million to $38.5 million for fiscal year 2016 from $38.7 million for the fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a $4.0 million increase in cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which was almost completely offset by a $1.9 million increase in dividends paid and a $1.9 million increase in cash outflow for treasury stock purchases from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $12.9 million to $38.7 million for fiscal year 2015 from $25.8 million for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a $25.0 million decrease in cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by a $12.5 million decrease in treasury stock purchases. Dividends paid also increased by $1.5 million from period to period.\n\ufeff\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes\n\ufeff\nAll of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balance is denominated in these foreign functional currencies, particularly at our U.K. subsidiary which operates in Pound Sterling. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these functional currencies against the U.S. Dollar at the end of each reporting period. The net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, when expressed in U.S. Dollar terms, was a decrease in cash of $4.2 million and $3.4 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an increase in cash of $2.0 million for fiscal year 2014. These changes were primarily due to fluctuations in various foreign currency exchange rates from period to period, but the majority is related to the fluctuations in the Pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar.\n\ufeff\nShare Repurchase Plans\n\ufeff\nOn October 14, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, once the Company's previous $60.0 million plan was exhausted, the Company was authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2016. The timing and amount of repurchases were based on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto. During the period from March 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 503,127 shares at a total cost of $47.8 million under this $75.0 million plan.\n\ufeff\nOn June 21, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective on September 1, 2016 and will remain in effect through August 31, 2018, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto.\n\ufeff\nDividends\n\ufeff\nThe Company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared an 11% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend, increasing it from $0.38 per share to $0.42 per share. On October 11, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share payable on October 31, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 21, 2016. Our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of August 31, 2016 for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands). Future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts.\n\ufeff\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2-3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,340 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,996 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,774 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>540 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>30 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe following summarizes other commitments which are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as of August 31, 2016:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 We have ongoing relationships with various suppliers (contract manufacturers) who manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers maintain title and control of certain raw materials and components, materials utilized in finished products, and of the finished products themselves until shipment to our customers or third-party distribution centers in accordance with agreed upon shipment terms. Although we typically do not have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with our contract manufacturers, when such obligations have been included, they have been immaterial. In the ordinary course of business, we communicate supply needs to our contract manufacturers based on orders and short-term projections, ranging from two to five months. We are committed to purchase the products produced by the contract manufacturers based on the projections provided. Upon the termination of contracts with contract manufacturers, we obtain certain inventory control rights and are obligated to work with the contract manufacturer to sell through all product held by or manufactured by the contract manufacturer on our behalf during the termination notification period. If any inventory remains at the contract manufacturer at the termination date, we are obligated to purchase such inventory which may include raw materials, components and finished goods. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Under the current terms of the credit facility agreement with Bank of America, we may borrow funds in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the five-year period commencing March 13, 2015 through May 13, 2020. As of August 31, 2016, we had $122.0 million outstanding on this credit facility. Based on our most recent cash projections and anticipated business activities, we expect to borrow additional amounts against this credit facility ranging from $20.0 million to $25.0 million in fiscal year 2017. We estimate that the interest associated with these borrowings will be approximately $0.6 million for fiscal year 2017 based on estimated applicable interest rates and the expected dates of future borrowings. For additional details on this revolving line of credit, refer to the information set forth in Note 7 - Debt. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 At August 31, 2016, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.2 million. We have estimated that up to $0.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax positions may be affected by the resolution of tax examinations or expiring statutes of limitation within the next twelve months. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations and financial condition, as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions and these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report includes a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results may have varied from those reported had different assumptions been used or other conditions prevailed. Our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentives\n\ufeff\nSales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to our customer when risks of loss and title have passed. Sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns, sales incentives, trade promotions and cash discounts. For certain of our sales we must make judgments and certain assumptions in order to determine when delivery has occurred. Through an\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nanalysis of end-of-period shipments for these particular sales, we determine an average time of transit of product to our customers, and this is used to estimate the time of delivery and whether revenue should be recognized during the current reporting period for such shipments. Differences in judgments or estimates related to the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nSales incentives are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives include on-going trade promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require us to estimate and accrue for the expected costs of such programs. These programs include cooperative marketing programs, shelf price reductions, coupons, rebates, consideration and allowances given to retailers for shelf space and/or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activities. Costs related to these sales incentive programs, with the exception of coupon costs, are recorded as a reduction to sales upon delivery of products to customers. Coupon costs are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as a reduction to sales as incurred, which is when the coupons are circulated.\n\ufeff\nSales incentives are calculated based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities. The determination of sales incentive costs and the related liabilities require us to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns, status of trade promotion activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category. We review our assumptions and adjust our sales incentive allowances accordingly on a quarterly basis. Our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates. If our accrual estimates for sales incentives at August 31, 2016 were to differ by 10%, the impact on net sales would be approximately $0.7 million.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nCurrent income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition to valuation allowances, we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes. Amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\n\ufeff\nU.S. federal income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. We determine whether our foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely based on the capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries. We reassess this determination each reporting period. Changes to this determination may be warranted based on our experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances.\n\ufeff\nValuation of Goodwill\n\ufeff\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill, intangibles and other. We assess for possible impairments to goodwill at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist.\n\ufeff\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed at the reporting unit level as required by the authoritative guidance. In accordance with ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment\u201d, companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We performed a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. In performing this qualitative assessment, we assessed relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of each of our reporting units. Factors that were considered included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) macroeconomic conditions; (2) industry and market conditions; (3) historical financial performance and expected financial performance; (4) other entity specific events, such as changes in management or key personnel; and (5) events affecting the Company's reporting units, such as a change in the composition of net assets or any expected dispositions. Based on the results of this qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of our reporting units is less than its fair value and, thus, the two-step quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconcluded that no impairment of our goodwill existed as of February 29, 2016. We also did not identify or record any impairment losses related to our goodwill during our annual impairment tests performed in fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\n\ufeff\nWhile we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test and analyses are reasonable, actual events and results could differ substantially from those included in the calculation. In the event that business conditions change in the future, we may be required to reassess and update our forecasts and estimates used in subsequent goodwill impairment analyses. If the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, an impairment charge to our goodwill balances may result at that time.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, there were no indicators of impairment identified as a result of our review of events and circumstances related to our goodwill subsequent to February 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nWe assess for potential impairments to our long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and/or its estimated remaining useful life may no longer be appropriate. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing market participants and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to results of operations. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.\n\ufeff\nThere were no indicators of potential impairment identified as a result of the Company's review of events and circumstances related to its existing definite-lived intangible assets for the periods ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\ufeff\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\ufeff\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d. The amendments address eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d, which requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The updated guidance also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this updated guidance include changes to simplify the Codification for several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including those related to the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures, minimum statutory withholding requirements and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows. Certain of these changes are required to be applied retrospectively while other changes are required to be applied prospectively. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating whether it will adopt this updated guidance in fiscal year 2017 or in fiscal year 2018, as required, but it expects that the adoption of this new guidance will have a more than inconsequential impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, if the Company had adopted this updated guidance in fiscal year 2016, its income tax expense for the year would have been reduced by approximately $2.1 million due to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than through additional paid-in-capital. The Company also expects to change its policy related to forfeitures upon adoption of this new guidance such that it will recognize the impacts of forfeitures as they occur rather than recognizing them based on an estimated forfeiture rate. Although the Company is still assessing the impacts of this change in policy for forfeitures on its consolidated financial statements, it does not expect that the impact will be material.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLeases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d. The core principle of this updated guidance and related amendments is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new rule also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance was originally to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral for the effective date of this guidance. Early adoption is permitted but only to the original effective date. Companies are permitted to adopt this new rule following either a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company does not intend to adopt this guidance early and it will become effective for the Company on September 1, 2018. The Company has not yet decided which implementation method it will adopt. Although management has completed its initial evaluation of this new guidance as it pertains to the Company, it is still in the process of determining the impacts that this updated guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nRelated Parties\n\ufeff\nOn October 11, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors elected Mr. Gregory A. Sandfort as a director of WD-40 Company. Mr. Sandfort is the Chief Executive Officer of Tractor Supply Company ( Tractor Supply\u201d), which is a WD-40 Company customer that acquires products from the Company in the ordinary course of business.\n\ufeff\nThe consolidated financial statements include sales to Tractor Supply of $1.2 million and $1.1 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts receivable from Tractor Supply were not material as of August 31, 2016.\n\ufeff", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide the reader of the Company's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. This MD&A includes the following sections: Overview, Highlights, Results of Operations, Performance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Critical Accounting Policies, Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Related Parties. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 15 of this report.\n\ufeff\nIn order to show the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, we have included constant currency disclosures, where necessary, in the Overview and Results of Operations sections which follow. Constant currency disclosures represent the translation of our current fiscal year revenues and expenses from the functional currencies of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We use results on a constant currency basis as one of the measures to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Results on a constant currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( non-GAAP\u201d) and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOverview\n\ufeff\nThe Company\n\ufeff\nWD-40 Company ( the Company\u201d), based in San Diego, California, is a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products which solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world. We market our maintenance products and our homecare and cleaning products under the following well-known brands: WD-40\u00ae, 3-IN-ONE\u00ae, GT85\u00ae, X-14\u00ae, 2000 Flushes\u00ae, Carpet Fresh\u00ae, no vac\u00ae, Spot Shot\u00ae, 1001\u00ae, Lava\u00ae and Solvol\u00ae. Currently included in the WD-40 brand are the WD-40 multi-use product and the WD-40 Specialist\u00ae and WD-40 BIKE\u00ae product lines.\n\ufeff\nOur brands are sold in various locations around the world. Maintenance products are sold worldwide in markets throughout North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Homecare and cleaning products are sold primarily in North America, the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) and Australia. We sell our products primarily through mass retail and home center stores, warehouse club stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, sport retailers, independent bike dealers, online retailers and industrial distributors and suppliers.\nHighlights\n\ufeff\nThe following summarizes the financial and operational highlights for our business during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Consolidated net sales increased $2.5 million, or 1%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $15.2 million on consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2016. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by $17.7 million, or 5%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Of the $15.2 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, $11.3 million came from our EMEA segment, which accounted for 36% of our consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Consolidated net sales for the WD-40 Specialist product line were $21.5 million which is a 14% increase for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Although the WD-40 Specialist product line is expected to provide the Company with long-term growth opportunities, we will see some volatility in sales levels from period to period due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, and various other factors that come with building a new product line. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 56.3% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 52.9% for the prior fiscal year. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Consolidated net income increased $7.8 million, or 17%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $2.8 million on consolidated net income for fiscal year 2016. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by $10.6 million, or 24%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Diluted earnings per common share for fiscal year 2016 were $3.64 versus $3.04 in the prior fiscal year. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Share repurchases continued to be executed under our $75.0 million share buy-back plan, which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors in October 2014 and which expired on August 31, 2016. During the period from September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 317,084 shares at an average price of $101.31 per share, for a total cost of $32.1 million. \n\ufeff\nOur strategic initiatives and the areas where we will continue to focus our time, talent and resources in future periods include: (i) maximizing WD-40 multi-use product sales through geographic expansion and increased market penetration; (ii) leveraging the WD-40 brand by growing the WD-40 Specialist product line; (iii) leveraging the strengths of the Company through broadened product and revenue base; (iv) attracting, developing and retaining talented people; and (v) operating with excellence.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nFiscal Year Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2015\n\ufeff\nOperating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes operating data for our consolidated operations (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts):\n\nNet Sales by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nAmericas\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Americas segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales in the Americas segment, which includes the U.S., Canada and Latin America, increased to $191.4 million, up $4.1 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates in Canada had an unfavorable impact on sales for the Americas segment from period to period. Sales for the fiscal year ended\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAugust 31, 2016 translated at the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year would have been $192.5 million in the Americas segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $5.2 million, or 3%, from period to period.\n\ufeff\nSales of maintenance products in the Americas segment increased $6.7 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This sales increase was mainly driven by higher sales of maintenance products in the U.S. and Latin America, which increased 6% and 3%, respectively, from period to period. The sales increase in the U.S. was primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities for all maintenance products and the added distribution of our new WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw product. The sales increase in Latin America was primarily due to the success of certain promotional programs which were conducted in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, primarily those in Mexico and Chile, as well as the continued growth of the WD-40 multi-use product throughout the Latin America region. The sales increases in the U.S. and Latin America were partially offset by a sales decrease in Canada of 14%, from period to period. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales associated with promotional programs, most of which was driven by unstable market and economic conditions, particularly in the industrial channel in Western Canada as a result of reduced activity in the oil industry. In addition, sales in Canada were negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates form period to period. Also contributing to the overall sales increase of maintenance products in the Americas segment was higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, which were up $1.1 million, or 10%, from period to period due to new distribution, particularly of certain new products within this product line during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.\n\ufeff\nSales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment decreased $2.6 million, or 9%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This sales decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Spot Shot carpet stain remover and 2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners, most of which is related to the U.S., of 13% and 7%, respectively. While each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows, we have continued to experience decreased or flat sales for many of these products primarily due to lost distribution, reduced product offerings, competition, category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers, particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels. At August 31, 2016, the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets associated with the Company's trade names for the homecare and cleaning products was $16.8 million, of which $9.3 million and $4.3 million were associated with the Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes trade names, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFor the Americas segment, 83% of sales came from the U.S., and 17% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year when 82% of sales came from the U.S., and 18% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined.\nEMEA\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n (1) While the Company's reporting currency is U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling. Although the functional currency of this subsidiary is Pound Sterling, approximately 45% of its sales are generated in Euro and 25% are generated in U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Pound Sterling sales and earnings for the EMEA segment can be negatively or positively impacted from period to period upon translation from these currencies depending on whether the Euro and U.S. Dollar are weakening or strengthening against the Pound Sterling. \n\ufeff\nSales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $135.2 million, down $1.6 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales for the EMEA segment from period to period. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 translated at the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year would have been $146.5 million in the EMEA segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $9.7 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe countries in EMEA where we sell through a direct sales force include the U.K., Italy, France, Iberia (which includes Spain and Portugal) and the Germanics sales region (which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands). Overall, sales from direct markets increased $1.2 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the direct markets in EMEA from period to period. On a constant currency basis, sales in the direct markets would have increased by 10% from fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe experienced sales increases throughout most of the EMEA direct markets for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, with percentage increases in sales as follows: the Germanics region, 10%; Italy, 9%; and France, 1%. Sales increases in these direct markets were primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 multi-use product, particularly in the Germanics region. Sales in the Germanics increased from period to period due to a change in the distribution model for the do-it-yourself (DIY) channel that we made for this region in fiscal year 2015. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from a distribution model for this channel where we sold product through a large wholesale customer who then supplied various retail customers to one where we sell direct to these retail customers. Due to the successful build of our direct customer base in this new model in fiscal year 2016, sales in this region were positively impacted from period to period. The increased sales in these regions were partially offset by sales decreases in the U.K. and Iberia of 6% and 1%, respectively. Sales in the U.K. decreased from period to period primarily due to decreased distribution of our 1001 brand in the retail channel from period to period. Sales generated in Euro in the direct markets also resulted in slightly higher Pound Sterling sales in fiscal year 2016 due the strengthening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling from period to period. The average exchange rate for the Euro against the Pound Sterling increased from 0.7497 to 0.7637, or 2%. Also contributing to the overall sales increase in the direct markets were increased sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line of $1.9 million, or 45%, from period to period due to expanded distribution. Sales from direct markets accounted for 66% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 63% of the EMEA segment's sales for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nThe regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. Sales in the distributor markets decreased $2.8 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an 11% decrease in sales in Russia as a result of the unstable market conditions in Eastern Europe which started in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Although the market conditions in Russia have begun to stabilize, our sales have not returned to the levels that we experienced prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Sales were also negatively impacted in fiscal year 2016 by continued political and economic instability in other countries in the distributor markets. Since a high percentage of sales in the distributor markets in the EMEA segment are generated in U.S. Dollars, there were insignificant impacts due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. The distributor markets accounted for 34% of the EMEA segment's total sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, compared to 37% for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region remained constant at $54.0 million for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales for the Asia Pacific segment from period to period. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 translated at the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year would have been $56.8 million in the Asia-Pacific segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $2.8 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nSales in Asia, which represented 69% of the total sales in the Asia-Pacific segment, increased $0.8 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Sales in the Asia distributor markets increased $0.7 million, or 3%, from period to period, primarily attributable to increased distribution resulting from the success of certain significant promotional programs for the WD-40 multi-use product in the Asian distributor markets, particularly those in Vietnam, Sri Lanka,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand Thailand. Although sales in China remained relatively constant at $13.3 million and $13.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in China. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 7% from period to period primarily due to increased distribution, particularly in Southern China.\n\ufeff\nSales in Australia decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on Australia sales. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 7% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased distribution and higher sales levels resulting from successful promotional programs as well as continued growth of our base business.\n\ufeff\nGross Profit\n\ufeff\nGross profit increased to $214.4 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to $200.2 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 56.3% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 52.9% for the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nGross margin was positively impacted by 2.4 percentage points from period to period due to favorable net changes in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans in all three segments. There is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles. The average cost of crude oil which flowed through our cost of goods sold was significantly lower in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, thus resulting in positive impacts to our gross margin from period to period. Due to the volatility of the price of crude oil, it is uncertain whether we will realize the same level of benefit in our gross margin related to it in future periods. The combined effects of favorable sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs positively impacted gross margin by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix as a result of a higher portion of sales in the Americas segment being made of higher margin maintenance products from period to period. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 0.2 percentage points from period to period primarily due to sales price increases implemented in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific segments over the last twelve months. In addition, advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers decreased from period to period positively impacting gross margin by 0.1 percentage points. In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. The costs associated with certain promotional activities are recorded as a reduction to sales while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses.\n\ufeff\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted gross margin by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling in our EMEA segment from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The combined effect of the strengthening of both the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period caused an increase in our Pound Sterling sales, resulting in favorable impacts to the gross margin. These favorable impacts to gross margin were slightly offset by 0.1 percentage points due to higher warehousing and in-bound freight costs, particularly in the Americas segment from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNote that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $16.1 million and $15.8 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 increased $8.9 million to $117.8 million from $108.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 30.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 from 28.8% for the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, increased freight costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Employee-related costs, which include salaries, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock-based compensation and other fringe benefits, increased by $11.5 million. This increase was primarily due to higher accruals for earned incentive compensation from period to period as well as annual compensation increases, which take effect in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and increased headcount. Freight costs associated with shipping products to our customers increased $1.0 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in the EMEA segment from period to period as well as additional costs associated with the shift in the distribution model in the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGermanics region in EMEA. Other miscellaneous expenses, which primarily include sales commissions and depreciation expense, increased by $0.8 million period over period. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $4.4 million on SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 were $7.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively. Our research and development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. This team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Expenses\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 decreased $0.6 million to $22.3 million from $22.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 5.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 from 6.0% for the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on such expenses of $0.9 million from period to period. Thus, on a constant currency basis, advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year 2016 would have increased by $0.3 million, primarily due to a higher level of promotional programs and marketing support in the EMEA segment from period to period. Investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year 2017 is expected to be close to 6.0% of net sales.\n\ufeff\nAs a percentage of net sales, advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were $16.1 million and $16.0 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled $38.4 million and $38.9 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of Definite-lived Intangible Assets Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization of our definite-lived intangible assets remained constant at $3.0 million for both the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\ufeff\nIncome from Operations by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes income from operations by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n\ufeff\n (1) Unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments. These expenses are reported separate from the Company's identified segments and are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. \n\ufeff\nAmericas\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Americas segment increased to $48.4 million, up $1.7 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in sales and a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Americas segment increased from 52.6% to 55.1% period over period. This\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincrease in the gross margin was primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as favorable sales mix changes, which were slightly offset by increased warehousing and in-house freight costs from period to period. The higher level of sales from period to period was accompanied by a $5.1 million increase in operating expenses, most of which related to increased headcount and higher earned incentive compensation expenses period over period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 24.9% to 25.3% period over period.\n\ufeff\nEMEA\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the EMEA segment increased to $31.7 million, up $1.5 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher gross margin, which was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in sales and higher operating expenses. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the EMEA segment increased from 54.6% to 58.7% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as sales price increases. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also had a significant favorable impact on gross margin from period to period. Operating expenses increased $3.1 million mainly related to higher earned incentive compensation expenses period over period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 22.0% to 27.0% period over period.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to $15.2 million, up $2.6 million, or 20%, the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Asia-Pacific segment increased from 49.9% to 54.8% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, sales price increases, and a lower level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we gave to our customers from period to period. Also contributing to the increased gross margin from period to period was the write-off of product and other costs related to a quality issue that occurred during fiscal year 2015 in the Asia distributor markets. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 23.4% to 28.1% period over period.\n\ufeff\nNon-Operating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\nInterest Income\n\ufeff\nInterest income remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher interest rates and an increased outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility period over period.\n\ufeff\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net changed by $4.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to net foreign currency exchange gains which were recorded for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to net foreign currency exchange losses which were recorded in the prior fiscal year as a result of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for both the Euro and the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe provision for income taxes was 27.7% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 29.0% for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was driven by an increase in the portion of taxable earnings attributable to foreign operations, particularly those in the U.K., which are taxed at lower tax rates.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nNet income was $52.6 million, or $3.64 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2016 compared to $44.8 million, or $3.04 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had an unfavorable impact of $2.8 million on net income for fiscal year 2016. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income for fiscal year 2016 would have been $55.4 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFiscal Year Ended August 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2014\n\ufeff\nOperating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes operating data for our consolidated operations (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts):\n\nNet Sales by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nAmericas\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Americas segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales in the Americas segment, which includes the U.S., Canada and Latin America, increased to $187.3 million, up $6.5 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nSales of maintenance products in the Americas segment increased $7.0 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of WD-40 maintenance products in Latin America and the U.S., which were up 7% and 5%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nyear 2014. The increase in Latin America was primarily due to new distribution and successful promotional programs that were conducted during fiscal year 2015 throughout the Latin America region, particularly those in Brazil and Mexico. The sales increase in the U.S. from period to period was primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities and increased distribution for the WD-40 multi-use product. Sales in the U.S. were also positively impacted from period to period due to the launch of our new innovative WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw product in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. These sales increases in Latin America and the U.S. were slightly offset by a sales decrease of 3% for maintenance products in Canada, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In functional currency, which is the Canadian Dollar, sales of maintenance products in Canada increased by 8% from period to period. Also contributing to the overall sales increase of the maintenance products in the Americas segment from period to period were higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, which were up $2.3 million, or 26%, due to increased promotional activities and new distribution during fiscal year 2015.\n\ufeff\nSales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment decreased $0.5 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. While total sales of homecare and cleaning products in the U.S., which is where the majority of such sales originate, remained relatively constant from period to period, sales of such products decreased in Canada for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. In Canada, sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased 22% driven primarily by the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period and lower sales of 2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners and Spot Shot, which were down 24% and 19%, respectively, for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. In functional currency, sales of homecare and cleaning products in Canada decreased by 13% from period to period. While each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows, we have continued to experience decreased or flat sales for many of these products primarily due to lost distribution, reduced product offerings, competition, category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers, particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels.\n\ufeff\nFor the Americas segment, 82% of sales came from the U.S., and 18% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to the distribution for fiscal year 2014 when 81% of sales came from the U.S., and 19% of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined.\nEMEA\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (1) While the Company's reporting currency is U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling. Although the functional currency of this subsidiary is Pound Sterling, approximately 45% of its sales are generated in Euro and 25% are generated in U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Pound Sterling sales and earnings for the EMEA segment can be negatively or positively impacted from period to period upon translation from these currencies depending on whether the Euro and U.S. Dollar are weakening or strengthening against the Pound Sterling. \n\ufeff\nSales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $136.9 million, down $14.5 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 had an unfavorable impact on sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 translated at the exchange rates in effect for fiscal year 2014 would have been $144.3 million in the EMEA segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have decreased by $7.1 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nThe countries in Europe where we sell through a direct sales force include the U.K., Italy, France, Iberia (which includes Spain and Portugal) and the Germanics sales region (which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands). Overall, sales from direct markets decreased $6.6 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. We experienced sales decreases throughout most of the Europe direct markets for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, with percentage decreases in sales as follows: Italy, 23%; the Germanics region, 12%; Iberia, 8%; and France, 7%. The decreased sales in these regions were slightly offset by the sales increase of 3%\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin the U.K. from period to period. The overall sales decline was primarily due to the continued weakening of the Euro, the currency in which a substantial portion of the direct markets sales are generated, relative to the Pound Sterling from period to period. The average exchange rate for the Euro against the Pound Sterling decreased by 9% to 0.7497 during fiscal year 2015 from 0.8265 for fiscal year 2014. As a result of this change in the foreign currency exchange rates, our sales in the direct markets decreased from period to period in Pound Sterling. Although sales in the direct markets decreased from period to period, sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line increased $0.9 million, or 26%, due to expanded distribution of the product line in fiscal year 2015. Sales from direct markets accounted for 63% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 62% of the EMEA segment's sales for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nThe regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. Sales in the distributor markets decreased $7.9 million, or 14%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a significant decrease in sales in Russia and Ukraine as a result of the political and economic instability in Eastern Europe. Sales to Russia and Ukraine decreased by approximately 30% and 77%, respectively, from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015. Sales also decreased in the Middle East from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to lower sales of the WD-40 multi-use product in Afghanistan. These overall sales decreases were slightly offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period, which increased sales, and higher sales volume of WD-40 multi-use product in Northern Europe due to the continued growth of our base business. The distributor markets accounted for 37% of the total EMEA segment sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, compared to 38% for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region increased to $54.0 million, up $3.1 million, or 6% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 had an unfavorable impact on sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 translated at the exchange rates in effect for fiscal year 2014 would have been $56.1 million in the Asia-Pacific segment. Thus, on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by $5.3 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nSales in Asia, which represented 68% of the total sales in the Asia-Pacific segment, increased $3.6 million, or 11%, for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Sales in the Asia distributor markets increased $2.4 million, or 11%, from period to period primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 multi-use product throughout most of the distributor markets, including those in South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia. Sales in China increased $1.2 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to new distribution, much of which came from Southern China, and increased promotional activities from period to period.\n\ufeff\nSales in Australia decreased by $0.5 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on Australia sales. In functional currency, which is the Australian Dollar, sales increased by 10%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased distribution and promotional activities from period to period as well as a price increase which was implemented at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGross Profit\n\ufeff\nGross profit increased to $200.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to $198.9 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 52.9% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 51.9% for fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nGross margin was positively impacted by 1.6 percentage points from period to period due to favorable net changes in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans in all three segments. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 0.3 percentage points from period to period due to sales price increases. These sales price increases were implemented in certain locations and markets in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA segments over the last twelve months of fiscal year 2015. In addition, gross margin was positively impacted by 0.1 percentage points from period to period due to lower warehousing and in-bound freight costs, particularly in the Americas segment.\n\ufeff\nThese favorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by 0.3 percentage points due to a higher level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers from period to period. The increase in such discounts was due to a higher percentage of sales being subject to promotional allowances during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily in the Asia-Pacific and Americas segments. In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. The costs associated with certain promotional activities are recorded as a reduction to sales while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted gross margin by 0.5 percentage points primarily due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling in our EMEA segment from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The net effect of the general weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period caused a decrease in our sales, resulting in unfavorable impacts to the gross margin. The combined effects of unfavorable sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs also negatively impacted gross margin by 0.2 percentage points from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNote that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $15.8 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 increased $0.3 million to $108.9 million from $108.6 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 28.8% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 from 28.3% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, a higher level of expenses associated with travel and meetings, higher costs associated with new product exploration, and increased depreciation expense, from period to period. Employee-related costs, which include salaries, incentive compensation, profit sharing, stock-based compensation and other fringe benefits, increased by $1.7 million from period to period primarily due to annual compensation increases, higher staffing levels and other employee-related costs we incurred associated with changes that we made to our WD-40 Bike business in the United States. These increases were partially offset by lower earned incentive compensation, from period to period. Travel and meeting expenses increased $0.8 million due to a higher level of travel expenses associated with various sales meetings and activities in support of our strategic initiatives. The $0.8 million increase in new product exploration expenses, which are included in research and development costs, was primarily due to an increased level of spending during fiscal year 2015 related to the continued development of our products within the WD-40 brand. Depreciation expense increased by $0.5 million from period to period primarily due to our continued investment in computer system related assets and other capital assets which support our general business operations. Other miscellaneous expenses, which primarily include general office overhead, sales commission, and insurance costs, also increased by $0.5 million period over period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in professional services costs from period to period, primarily due to lower legal fees associated with litigation activities and general consulting services in our Americas and EMEA segments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $2.6 million on SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nWe continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014 were $9.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Our research and development team engages in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconsumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. This team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion Expenses\n\ufeff\nAdvertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 decreased $1.0 million, or 4%, to $22.9 million from $23.9 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 6.0% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 from 6.2% for fiscal year 2014. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expenses was primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in the EMEA segment from period to period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were $16.0 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled $38.9 million and $40.1 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of Definite-lived Intangible Assets Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization of our definite-lived intangible assets was $3.0 million and $2.6 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This $0.4 million increase from period to period was primarily due to the GT85 Limited acquisition, which we completed in September 2014.\n\ufeff\nIncome from Operations by Segment\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes income from operations by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n (1) Unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments. These expenses are reported separate from the Company's identified segments and are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. \n\ufeff\nAmericas\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Americas segment increased to $46.7 million, up $5.3 million, or 13%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in sales and a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Americas segment increased from 51.0% to 52.6% period over period. This increase in the gross margin was primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as decreased warehousing and in-bound freight costs from period to period. The higher level of sales from period to period in the Americas segment was accompanied by a $1.0 million increase in total operating expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 22.9% to 24.9% period over period.\n\ufeff\nEMEA\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the EMEA segment decreased to $30.2 million, down $3.8 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a $14.5 million decrease in sales. As a percentage of net sales,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngross profit for the EMEA segment increased from 54.0% to 54.6% period over period primarily due to the combined positive impacts of decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans and price increases, both of which were significantly offset by the unfavorable impacts of changes in sales mix and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and U.S. Dollar. The net effects of the continued weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling from period to period has caused our sales to decrease, resulting in unfavorable impacts to the gross margin. The lower level of sales was accompanied by a $3.2 million decrease in total operating expenses driven mainly by lower advertising and sales promotion expenses, freight costs and earned incentive compensation. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 22.5% to 22.0% period over period.\n\ufeff\nAsia-Pacific\n\ufeff\nIncome from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to $12.6 million, up $2.2 million, or 22%, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in sales and a higher gross margin. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for the Asia-Pacific segment increased from 48.9% to 49.9% from period to period due to the combined positive impacts of sales price increases and decreased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, both of which were partially offset by a higher level of advertising, promotional and other discounts that we gave to our customers from period to period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 20.4% to 23.4% period over period.\n\ufeff\nNon-Operating Items\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations (in thousands):\n\nInterest Income\n\ufeff\nInterest income remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense increased $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a higher outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility period over period.\n\ufeff\nOther Expense\n\ufeff\nOther expense increased by $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net foreign currency exchange losses from period to period as a result of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe provision for income taxes was 29.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 compared to 30.5% for fiscal year 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily attributable to an increase in the taxable income in the U.K., which is taxed at lower statutory income tax rates.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nNet income was $44.8 million, or $3.04 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2015 compared to $43.7 million, or $2.87 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for fiscal year 2014. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had an unfavorable impact of $1.7 million on net income for fiscal year 2015. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income for fiscal year 2015 would have been $46.5 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPerformance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n\ufeff\nIn managing our business operations and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with certain non-GAAP performance measures. These performance measures are part of our current 55/30/25 business model, which includes gross margin, cost of doing business, and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), the latter two of which are non-GAAP performance measures. Cost of doing business is defined as total operating expenses less amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, impairment charges related to intangible assets and depreciation in operating departments, and EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we changed to this new 55/30/25 business model from our previous 50/30/20 business model. This means that we now target our gross margin to be 55% of net sales, our cost of doing business to be 30% of net sales, and our EBITDA to be 25% of net sales. Results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors, including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future such as those related to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard our WD-40 brand. The targets for these performance measures are long-term in nature, particularly those for cost of doing business and EBITDA, and we expect to make progress towards achieving them over time as our revenues increase.\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes the results of these performance measures:\n\n (1) Percentages may not aggregate to EBITDA percentage due to rounding and because amounts recorded in other income (expense), net on the Company's consolidated statement of operations are not included as an adjustment to earnings in the EBITDA calculation. \n\ufeff\nWe use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative performance of the Company from period to period. We believe that these measures provide our shareholders with additional insights into the Company's results of operations and how we run our business. The non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, income from operations or other financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP as indicators of the Company's performance or operations. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to our financial statements as prepared in accordance with GAAP are as follows:\n\ufeff\nCost of Doing Business (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEBITDA (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nThe Company's financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Net cash provided by operations was $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015. We believe we continue to be well positioned to weather any uncertainty in the capital markets and global economy due to our strong balance sheet and efficient business model, along with our growing and diversified global revenues. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth.\n\ufeff\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations and cash currently available from our existing $175.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America\u201d), which expires on May 13, 2020. To date, we have used the proceeds of the revolving credit facility for our stock repurchases and plan to continue using such proceeds for our general working capital needs and stock repurchases under our board approved share buy-back plan. The Company also utilized this revolving credit facility in September 2016 to fund the purchase of its new headquarters office, which will house both corporate employees and employees in the Company's Americas segment. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we had net new borrowings of $14.0 million U.S. dollars under the revolving credit facility. We regularly convert existing draws on our line of credit to new draws with new maturity dates and interest rates. As of August 31, 2016, we had a $122.0 million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, all of which was classified as long-term, and there were no other letters of credit outstanding or restrictions on the amount available on this line of credit. Per the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement, our consolidated leverage ratio cannot be greater than three to one and our consolidated interest coverage ratio cannot be less than three to one. See Note 7 - Debt for additional information on these financial covenants. At August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants as required by the revolving credit facility and believe it is unlikely we will fail to comply with any of these covenants over the next twelve months. We would need to have a significant decrease in sales and/or a significant increase in expenses in order for us to not comply with the debt covenants.\n\ufeff\nAt August 31, 2016, we had a total of $108.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Of this balance, $102.2 million was held in Europe, Australia and China in foreign currencies. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management determined that it would undertake, in fiscal year 2017, a one-time repatriation of $8.2 million, which represents all of the historical foreign earnings from its Australia subsidiary and 90% of the historical foreign earnings from its China subsidiary. Management determined that such a foreign distribution was prudent due to the current favorable tax consequences of such a distribution, stemming principally from the recent significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various currencies in which the Company conducts business. Accordingly, we determined that we were no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to this amount of unremitted earnings and recorded the impact of this decision in the 2016 income tax provision, which resulted in the recognition of an incremental immaterial tax benefit. It is the Company's current intention to indefinitely reinvest any future foreign earnings of its Australia and China subsidiaries. However, management will make such determination based on an evaluation of facts and circumstances at each future reporting date.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our future cash from domestic operations, together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund both short-term and long-term operating requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions and new business development activities in the United States.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlthough we hold a significant amount of cash outside of the United States and the draws on the credit facility to date have been made by our entity in the United States, we do not foresee any ongoing issues with repaying or refinancing these loans with domestically generated funds since we closely monitor the use of this credit facility. In the event that management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate additional foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., we would be required to record additional tax expense at the time when we determine that such foreign earnings are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of August 31, 2016, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on $113.4 million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, mostly attributable to the U.K., since these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2016, the liquidity provided by our $175.0 million revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected consolidated operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including: future debt, principal and interest payments, future capital expenditure requirements, future share repurchases, future dividend payments (which are determined on a quarterly basis by the Company's Board of Directors), alternative investment opportunities, debt covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5.5 million to $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 from $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was net income of $52.6 million, which increased $7.8 million from period to period. This increase was slightly offset by changes in our working capital, which were primarily attributable to an overall increase in the trade accounts receivable balance due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and the timing of payments received from our customers from period to period. Also contributing to the change in working capital from period to period were lower earned incentive payouts in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as well as significantly higher accruals for earned incentive compensation in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior year period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $16.4 million to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015 from $38.7 million for fiscal year 2014. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 was net income of $44.8 million. The changes in our working capital from period to period were primarily attributable to an overall decrease in the trade accounts receivable balance due to decreased sales volumes and the timing of payments received from our customers from period to period. In addition, the net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the overall decrease in inventory levels due to the timing of our inventory purchases from period to period. Also contributing to the changes in working capital from period to period were lower earned incentive payouts and accruals in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The settlement of an insurance reimbursable item in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, and lower income taxes receivable balances also contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities from period to period.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $4.0 million to $20.9 million for fiscal year 2016 from $16.9 million for fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in net purchases of short-term investments that were made by our U.K. and Australia subsidiaries. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $4.1 million in cash outflow related to the GT85 Limited\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nacquisition which was completed by our U.K. subsidiary in early fiscal year 2015 and a $1.4 million decrease in capital expenditures from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $6.4 million to $16.9 million for fiscal year 2015 from $10.5 million for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a $4.1 million cash outflow related to the GT85 Limited acquisition which was completed by our U.K. subsidiary in September 2014. Of this $4.1 million purchase consideration, $3.7 million was paid in early fiscal year 2015 and the remaining balance was paid in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. Also contributing to the total cash outflows were a $2.9 million increase in purchases of short-term investments that were made by our U.K. and Australia subsidiaries, and a $1.7 million increase in capital expenditures from period to period. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in cash outflow related to the Belgium customer list which was acquired by our U.K. subsidiary for $1.8 million in fiscal year 2014.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $0.2 million to $38.5 million for fiscal year 2016 from $38.7 million for the fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a $4.0 million increase in cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which was almost completely offset by a $1.9 million increase in dividends paid and a $1.9 million increase in cash outflow for treasury stock purchases from period to period.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $12.9 million to $38.7 million for fiscal year 2015 from $25.8 million for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a $25.0 million decrease in cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by a $12.5 million decrease in treasury stock purchases. Dividends paid also increased by $1.5 million from period to period.\n\ufeff\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes\n\ufeff\nAll of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balance is denominated in these foreign functional currencies, particularly at our U.K. subsidiary which operates in Pound Sterling. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these functional currencies against the U.S. Dollar at the end of each reporting period. The net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, when expressed in U.S. Dollar terms, was a decrease in cash of $4.2 million and $3.4 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an increase in cash of $2.0 million for fiscal year 2014. These changes were primarily due to fluctuations in various foreign currency exchange rates from period to period, but the majority is related to the fluctuations in the Pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar.\n\ufeff\nShare Repurchase Plans\n\ufeff\nOn October 14, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, once the Company's previous $60.0 million plan was exhausted, the Company was authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2016. The timing and amount of repurchases were based on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto. During the period from March 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 503,127 shares at a total cost of $47.8 million under this $75.0 million plan.\n\ufeff\nOn June 21, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective on September 1, 2016 and will remain in effect through August 31, 2018, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto.\n\ufeff\nDividends\n\ufeff\nThe Company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared an 11% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend, increasing it from $0.38 per share to $0.42 per share. On October 11, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share payable on October 31, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 21, 2016. Our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of August 31, 2016 for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands). Future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe following summarizes other commitments which are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as of August 31, 2016:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 We have ongoing relationships with various suppliers (contract manufacturers) who manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers maintain title and control of certain raw materials and components, materials utilized in finished products, and of the finished products themselves until shipment to our customers or third-party distribution centers in accordance with agreed upon shipment terms. Although we typically do not have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with our contract manufacturers, when such obligations have been included, they have been immaterial. In the ordinary course of business, we communicate supply needs to our contract manufacturers based on orders and short-term projections, ranging from two to five months. We are committed to purchase the products produced by the contract manufacturers based on the projections provided. Upon the termination of contracts with contract manufacturers, we obtain certain inventory control rights and are obligated to work with the contract manufacturer to sell through all product held by or manufactured by the contract manufacturer on our behalf during the termination notification period. If any inventory remains at the contract manufacturer at the termination date, we are obligated to purchase such inventory which may include raw materials, components and finished goods. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Under the current terms of the credit facility agreement with Bank of America, we may borrow funds in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the five-year period commencing March 13, 2015 through May 13, 2020. As of August 31, 2016, we had $122.0 million outstanding on this credit facility. Based on our most recent cash projections and anticipated business activities, we expect to borrow additional amounts against this credit facility ranging from $20.0 million to $25.0 million in fiscal year 2017. We estimate that the interest associated with these borrowings will be approximately $0.6 million for fiscal year 2017 based on estimated applicable interest rates and the expected dates of future borrowings. For additional details on this revolving line of credit, refer to the information set forth in Note 7 - Debt. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 At August 31, 2016, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.2 million. We have estimated that up to $0.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax positions may be affected by the resolution of tax examinations or expiring statutes of limitation within the next twelve months. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations and financial condition, as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions and these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report includes a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results may have varied from those reported had different assumptions been used or other conditions prevailed. Our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentives\n\ufeff\nSales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to our customer when risks of loss and title have passed. Sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns, sales incentives, trade promotions and cash discounts. For certain of our sales we must make judgments and certain assumptions in order to determine when delivery has occurred. Through an\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nanalysis of end-of-period shipments for these particular sales, we determine an average time of transit of product to our customers, and this is used to estimate the time of delivery and whether revenue should be recognized during the current reporting period for such shipments. Differences in judgments or estimates related to the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nSales incentives are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives include on-going trade promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require us to estimate and accrue for the expected costs of such programs. These programs include cooperative marketing programs, shelf price reductions, coupons, rebates, consideration and allowances given to retailers for shelf space and/or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activities. Costs related to these sales incentive programs, with the exception of coupon costs, are recorded as a reduction to sales upon delivery of products to customers. Coupon costs are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as a reduction to sales as incurred, which is when the coupons are circulated.\n\ufeff\nSales incentives are calculated based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities. The determination of sales incentive costs and the related liabilities require us to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns, status of trade promotion activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category. We review our assumptions and adjust our sales incentive allowances accordingly on a quarterly basis. Our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates. If our accrual estimates for sales incentives at August 31, 2016 were to differ by 10%, the impact on net sales would be approximately $0.7 million.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nCurrent income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition to valuation allowances, we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes. Amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\n\ufeff\nU.S. federal income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. We determine whether our foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely based on the capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries. We reassess this determination each reporting period. Changes to this determination may be warranted based on our experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances.\n\ufeff\nValuation of Goodwill\n\ufeff\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill, intangibles and other. We assess for possible impairments to goodwill at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist.\n\ufeff\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed at the reporting unit level as required by the authoritative guidance. In accordance with ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment\u201d, companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We performed a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. In performing this qualitative assessment, we assessed relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of each of our reporting units. Factors that were considered included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) macroeconomic conditions; (2) industry and market conditions; (3) historical financial performance and expected financial performance; (4) other entity specific events, such as changes in management or key personnel; and (5) events affecting the Company's reporting units, such as a change in the composition of net assets or any expected dispositions. Based on the results of this qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of our reporting units is less than its fair value and, thus, the two-step quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconcluded that no impairment of our goodwill existed as of February 29, 2016. We also did not identify or record any impairment losses related to our goodwill during our annual impairment tests performed in fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\n\ufeff\nWhile we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test and analyses are reasonable, actual events and results could differ substantially from those included in the calculation. In the event that business conditions change in the future, we may be required to reassess and update our forecasts and estimates used in subsequent goodwill impairment analyses. If the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, an impairment charge to our goodwill balances may result at that time.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, there were no indicators of impairment identified as a result of our review of events and circumstances related to our goodwill subsequent to February 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nWe assess for potential impairments to our long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and/or its estimated remaining useful life may no longer be appropriate. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing market participants and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to results of operations. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.\n\ufeff\nThere were no indicators of potential impairment identified as a result of the Company's review of events and circumstances related to its existing definite-lived intangible assets for the periods ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\ufeff\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\ufeff\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d. The amendments address eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d, which requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The updated guidance also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this updated guidance include changes to simplify the Codification for several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including those related to the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures, minimum statutory withholding requirements and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows. Certain of these changes are required to be applied retrospectively while other changes are required to be applied prospectively. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating whether it will adopt this updated guidance in fiscal year 2017 or in fiscal year 2018, as required, but it expects that the adoption of this new guidance will have a more than inconsequential impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For example, if the Company had adopted this updated guidance in fiscal year 2016, its income tax expense for the year would have been reduced by approximately $2.1 million due to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than through additional paid-in-capital. The Company also expects to change its policy related to forfeitures upon adoption of this new guidance such that it will recognize the impacts of forfeitures as they occur rather than recognizing them based on an estimated forfeiture rate. Although the Company is still assessing the impacts of this change in policy for forfeitures on its consolidated financial statements, it does not expect that the impact will be material.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLeases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d. The core principle of this updated guidance and related amendments is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new rule also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance was originally to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral for the effective date of this guidance. Early adoption is permitted but only to the original effective date. Companies are permitted to adopt this new rule following either a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company does not intend to adopt this guidance early and it will become effective for the Company on September 1, 2018. The Company has not yet decided which implementation method it will adopt. Although management has completed its initial evaluation of this new guidance as it pertains to the Company, it is still in the process of determining the impacts that this updated guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nRelated Parties\n\ufeff\nOn October 11, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors elected Mr. Gregory A. Sandfort as a director of WD-40 Company. Mr. Sandfort is the Chief Executive Officer of Tractor Supply Company ( Tractor Supply\u201d), which is a WD-40 Company customer that acquires products from the Company in the ordinary course of business.\n\ufeff\nThe consolidated financial statements include sales to Tractor Supply of $1.2 million and $1.1 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts receivable from Tractor Supply were not material as of August 31, 2016.\n\ufeff", "item_7_tables": "Table 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>
