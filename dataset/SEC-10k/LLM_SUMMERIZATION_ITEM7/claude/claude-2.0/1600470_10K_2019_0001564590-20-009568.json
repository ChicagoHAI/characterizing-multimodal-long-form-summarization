The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe are an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. On February 28, 2019, we completed a business combination (the BRMR Merger\u201d) with Blue Ridge Mountain Resources, Inc. ( BRMR\u201d), and immediately thereafter, we changed our legal name from Eclipse Resources Corporation\u201d to Montage Resources Corporation.\u201d Except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d as used herein refer, for periods prior to the completion of the BRMR Merger, to Eclipse Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries and, for periods following the completion of the BRMR Merger, to Montage Resources Corporation ( Montage\u201d) and its subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had assembled an acreage position approximating 233,800 net surface acres in Eastern Ohio, 38,700 net surface acres in Pennsylvania, and 49,700 net surface acres in West Virginia. Approximately 192,800 of our net acres are located in the Utica Shale fairway, which we refer to as the Utica Core Area, and approximately 55,300 net acres of stacked pay opportunity are also prospective for the highly liquids rich area of the Marcellus Shale in Eastern Ohio and West Virginia within what we refer to as our Marcellus Area. Additionally, we own approximately 74,100 net acres (which are approximately 80% held by production) outside of the Utica Core Area that may be prospective for the oil window of the Utica Shale.\nWe are the operator of approximately 98% of our net acreage within the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area. We intend to focus on developing our substantial inventory of horizontal drilling locations during commodity price environments that will allow us to generate attractive returns and will continue to opportunistically add to this acreage position where we can acquire acreage at attractive prices.\nOutside of the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area, we had 1,002 gross (975.3 net) conventional wells operated under multiple subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019.\nThe net assets of our subsidiary, Magnum Hunter Production, Inc. ( MHP\u201d), are classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale as of December 31, 2019. All operations of MHP are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2019:\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we were operating one horizontal rig;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we had 370 gross (235.7 net) wells within the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area, of which 1 gross (0.7 net) were drilling, 6 gross (5.2 net) were awaiting completion, and 363 gross (229.8 net) had been turned to sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we had average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately 547.8 MMcfe, which was comprised of approximately 77% natural gas, 14% NGLs and 9% oil; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our estimated proved reserves were 2,729.8 Bcfe, or 455.0 MMBoe, based on reserve reports prepared by SIS, our independent petroleum engineers for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 55% of which were proved developed reserves. Our estimated proved reserves were approximately 78% natural gas, 15% NGLs and 7% oil, as of December 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors That Significantly Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were derived approximately 57%, 13% and 23% from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil, respectively (with the remaining 7% of revenues primarily attributable to brokered natural gas and marketing revenue). Our revenues, cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices have historically been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions, supply and demand of hydrocarbons in the marketplace and geopolitical events such as wars or natural disasters. Sustained periods of low prices for these commodities would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations, the quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce and our ability to access capital.\nWe use commodity derivative instruments to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our production. These arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases, but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases. Our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over-the-counter commodity derivative contracts with large financial institutions. Additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts is set forth in Note 7- Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLike other businesses engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and natural gas production from a given well naturally decreases. Thus, an exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of reserves it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from our existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production in a cost-effective manner. Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from our existing reserves and to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to access capital in a cost-effective manner and to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals.\nOur financial condition and results of operations, including the growth of production, cash flows and reserves, are driven by several factors, including:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> success in drilling new wells;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> natural gas, NGLs and oil prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities and our ability to execute them;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of capital we invest in the leasing and development of our properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facility or equipment availability and unexpected downtime;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the rate at which production volumes on our wells naturally decline.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors That Significantly Affect Comparability of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, for the following reasons:\nDrilling Joint Venture. On December 22, 2017, we entered into definitive agreements with Sequel Energy Group LLC ( Sequel\u201d) (an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners LP) to establish a drilling joint venture on our Utica Shale acreage in Guernsey and Monroe counties in southeast Ohio. We have committed funding from Sequel of up to $285 million to fund its proportionate share of two drilling programs comprising of 33 gross wells in aggregate. We retained 50% of our pre-carry working interest in the first program and 30% of our pre-carry working interest in the second program. We received a 15% carried interest on drilling and completion capital expenditures incurred in each well program, which was proportionately reduced based upon our retained pre-carry working interest in such well program, and a significant portion of Sequel's working interest in each well program will revert to Montage once a certain return is realized by Sequel in each program. We are the operator of all wells drilled within each well program.\nFlat Castle Acquisition. On January 18, 2018, Eclipse Resources-PA, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its acquisition of certain oil and gas leases, wells and other oil and gas rights and interests covering approximately 44,500 net acres located in the counties of Tioga and Potter in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from Travis Peak. The aggregate adjusted purchase price for the Flat Castle Acquisition was $92.2 million, which was paid entirely with approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nBRMR Merger. On February 28, 2019, the Company completed its business combination transaction with Blue Ridge Mountain Resources, Inc. ( BRMR\u201d) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 25, 2018 and amended as of January 7, 2019 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, Everest Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d), and BRMR. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BRMR with BRMR continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the BRMR Merger\u201d).\nAs a result of the BRMR Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of BRMR issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the BRMR Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), excluding certain Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), was converted into the right to receive from the Company 0.29506 of a validly issued, fully-paid, and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The exchange ratio reflects an adjustment to account for the 15-to-1 reverse stock split described below. Former stockholders of BRMR received cash for any fractional shares of the Company's common stock to which they might have otherwise been entitled as a result of the BRMR Merger. In addition, upon completion of the BRMR Merger, all shares of BRMR restricted stock and all BRMR restricted stock units and performance interest awards were converted into the right to receive shares of common stock of the Company or cash, in each case as specified in the Merger Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split. Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time on February 28, 2019, the Company effected a 15-to-1 reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock. Holders of shares of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time received cash for any fractional shares of the Company's common stock to which they might have otherwise been entitled as a result of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split lowered the aggregate par value of the common stock reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity to reflect the reduced shares with the offset to additional paid-in-capital. All issued and outstanding share and per share amounts as of and for the periods prior to February 28, 2019 presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split in accordance with ASC 505 Equity\u201d.\nPlease see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Recent Developments\u201d for a description of other recent developments and transactions that may affect the comparability of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented to future periods.\nSource of Our Revenues\nSubstantially all of our historical revenues are derived from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil, and do not include the effects of derivatives. Revenues from product sales are a function of the volumes produced, prevailing market prices, product quality, gas Btu content and transportation costs. We generally sell production at a specific delivery point, pay transportation costs to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. We record transportation costs as transportation, gathering and compression expense. We also may derive revenue from brokered gas or revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not related to our production and from the release of firm transportation capacity, which we refer to as brokered natural gas and marketing revenue. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.\nPrincipal Components of Our Cost Structure\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Lease operating. These are day-to-day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground along with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties.

These are costs incurred to bring natural gas, NGLs, and oil to the market. Such costs include the costs to operate and maintain our low- and high-pressure gathering and compression systems as well as fees paid to third parties who operate gathering systems that transport our gas. They also include costs to process and extract NGLs from our produced gas and to transport our NGLs and oil to market. We often enter into fixed price long-term contracts that secure transportation and processing capacity which may include minimum volume commitments, the cost for which is included in these expenses to the extent that they are not excess capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Production and ad valorem taxes.

This also includes the monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells, service assets, pipelines and other facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Exploration.

These reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property's life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Impairment of oil and gas properties. Properties are evaluated for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value.

The amount of future gain or loss recognized on derivative instruments is dependent upon future gas prices, which will affect the value of the contracts. Cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty. In addition to gains and losses recognized from changes in fair value of the derivative instruments, gain (loss) on derivative instruments includes actual amounts realized from settlement of derivative instruments upon expiration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Interest expense. We have historically financed a portion of our cash requirements with proceeds from fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by our financing decisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nIn evaluating our current and future financial results, we focus on production and revenue growth, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense (both before and after non-cash stock compensation expense) and operating margin per unit of production. In addition to these metrics, we use Adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure, to evaluate our financial results. Adjusted EBITDAX\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) before interest expense or interest income; income taxes; write-down of abandoned leases; impairments; depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d); amortization of deferred financing costs; gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net cash receipts (payments) on settled derivative instruments, and premiums (paid) received on options that settled during the period; non-cash compensation expense; gain or loss from sale of interest in gas properties; exploration expenses; and other unusual or infrequent items. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used and defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX provides no information regarding a company's capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, and working capital movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDAX does not represent funds available for discretionary use because those funds may be required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, income taxes, franchise taxes, exploration expenses, and other commitments and obligations.\nIn addition to the operating metrics above, as we grow our reserve base, we will assess our capital spending by calculating our operated proved developed reserves and our operated proved developed finding costs and development costs. We believe that operated proved developed finding and development costs are one of the key measurements of the performance of an oil and gas exploration and production company. We will focus on our operated properties as we control the location, spending and operations associated with drilling these properties. In determining our proved developed finding and development costs, only cash costs incurred in connection with exploration and development will be used in the calculation, while the costs of acquisitions will be excluded because our Board of Directors approves each material acquisition. In evaluating our proved developed reserve additions, any reserve revisions for changes in commodity prices between years will be excluded from the assessment, but any performance related reserve revisions are included.\nWe also continually evaluate our rates of return on invested capital in our wells. These rates of return calculations may include corporate level items such as land costs, general and administrative expenses, midstream costs and cash settled derivatives. We believe the quality of our assets combined with our technical and managerial expertise can generate attractive rates of return as we develop our acreage in the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area. We review changes in drilling and completion costs, lease operating costs, natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, well productivity, and other factors in order to focus our drilling on the highest rate of return areas within our acreage on a per well basis.\nAs a result of the closing of the BRMR Merger on February 28, 2019, BRMR's assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 and BRMR's revenues and expenses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. (See Note 3- Acquisition).\nOverview of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Results\nOperationally, our performance during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects continued development of our acreage, while focusing on capital preservation in the current commodity price environment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we achieved the following financial and operating results:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased our average daily net production for the year ended December 31, 2019 by 60% over the prior year, to 547.8 MMcfe per day;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commenced drilling 32 gross (28.2 net) operated wells, commenced completions of 36 gross (30.0 net) operated wells and turned-to-sales 39 gross (30.8 net) operated wells during the year ended December 31, 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> recognized net income of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> realized Adjusted EBITDAX of $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $261.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

A decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. We make price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of our cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancelable capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, our financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.\nThe Company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves through an environmentally responsible and cost-effective operational plan. The Company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company's ability to develop its reserves. Despite the continued low price commodity environment, the Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company's resource base, low cost structure, risk management strategies, and disciplined investment of capital.\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact of changes in future commodity prices on our reported estimated net proved reserves with any degree of certainty because of the various components and assumptions used in the process. However, the below sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of a 10% increase and decrease in commodity pricing to our reserves assuming all other inputs remain constant.\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Natural Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated Proved Reserves (Bcfe)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Discounted Future\nNet Cash Flows (PV-10)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity Pricing - SEC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,729.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,470.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reserves Sensitivity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,812.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,896.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,387.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,064.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The increase of $2.0 million in aggregate production and ad valorem taxes was primarily due to increased production and well count. The decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe was primarily due to the recognition of a refund for production taxes from a state taxing authority during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was approximately $156.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $134.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This $21.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in production and proved property costs during the year ended December 31, 2019. On a per Mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $0.77 in the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1.07 in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to a lower depletion rate resulting from our reserves increasing at a higher rate than our capital costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.35 in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase of $26.5 million was primarily related to approximately $21.5 million of expenses related to the BRMR Merger incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Expenses were consistent on a per Mcfe basis due to the increase in expenses being offset by increased production for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense includes $8.8 million and $7.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration, rig termination and standby and (gain) loss on sale of assets.

Brokered natural gas and marketing expense relate to gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of natural gas that was available for brokered gas transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nExploration expense was $58.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $49.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease in delay rentals related to the reduction in future drilling activity and focusing renewals in our core acreage during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment of unproved properties was $45.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 was the result of an increase in expected lease expirations due to a reduction in planned future drilling activity. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current commodity price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.\nRig termination and standby expense was $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the reduction in development activity. There was no rig termination and standby expense in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of assets was $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, each due to the sale of certain non-core assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments was $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to ($21.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to changes in commodity prices during each year. Cash receipts (payments) were approximately $20.3 million and ($27.0) million for the derivative instruments that settled during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest expense, net was $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $54.0 million for year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our increased borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was not recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to the Company recording a higher valuation allowance related to its pre-tax losses and reducing the valuation allowance to the extent of pre-tax income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNatural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations\nThe following table illustrates the revenue attributable to our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGLs sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered natural gas and marketing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 515,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 383,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur production grew by approximately 11.8 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2018 over the year ended December 31, 2017, as we placed new wells into production, partially offset by natural declines in well production.

The increase from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to an increase in the amount of firm transportation that was available for brokered gas transactions or release to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per Mcfe, basis. The following table presents information about certain of our expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation, gathering and compression\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production and ad valorem taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 134,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (164\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses per Mcfe:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation, gathering and compression\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production and ad valorem taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.04\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease operating expense was $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $20.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Lease operating expense per Mcfe was $0.23 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.18 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $7.8 million and $0.05 per Mcfe was attributable to increases in producing wells and salt water disposal expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018. Lease operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate our wells and non-recurring workovers and repairs.\nTransportation, gathering and compression expense was $138.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $124.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Transportation, gathering and compression expense per Mcfe was $1.10 in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

These expenses were consistent on a per unit basis as increased firm transportation and production costs were offset by lower contractual gathering rates.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and applicable tax rates. Production and ad valorem taxes were $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Production and ad valorem taxes per Mcfe was $0.08 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.07 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The $1.6 million increase in aggregate production and ad valorem taxes was primarily due to increased production and well count. The increase of $0.01 on a per unit basis was driven by increased severance taxes associated with our increased liquids production.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was approximately $134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $119.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This $15.6 million increase was primarily due to an increase in production and proved property costs. On a per Mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $1.07 in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1.05 in the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily due to a higher depletion rate resulting from our reserves increasing at a lower rate than our capital cost.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.35 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.39 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The $0.2 million decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and benefits associated with decreased head count, and lower professional fees partially offset by approximately $4.0 million of expense related to the BRMR Merger. The decrease of $0.04 per Mcfe was primarily due to fixed costs spread across increased levels of production as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. General and administrative expense includes $7.9 million and $9.3 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration, rig termination and standby and (gain) loss on sale of assets. The following table details our other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered natural gas and marketing expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exploration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (645\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig termination and standby\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,815\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,636\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrokered natural gas and marketing expense was $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense relate to gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of firm transportation that was available for brokered gas transactions or release to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nExploration expense decreased to $49.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

The increase in delay rentals related to converting future lump-sum extension payments into annual delay rentals.\nImpairment of unproved properties was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a decrease in expected lease expirations due to the increase in our planned future drilling activity. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current commodity price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.\nRig termination and standby expense was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was no rig termination and standby expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of assets was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, each due to the sale of certain non-core assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments was ($21.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to changes in commodity prices during each year. Cash payments were approximately $27.0 million and $2.2 million for the derivative instruments that settled during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest expense, net was $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $49.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was not recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to the Company recording a higher valuation allowance related to its pre-tax losses and reducing the valuation allowance to the extent of pre-tax income.\nCash Flows, Capital Resources and Liquidity\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by our operating cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity securities. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $255.4 million compared to $225.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash provided from operating activities reflects working capital changes, operating income, timing of cash receipts and disbursements and the increase in our production during the year-over-year comparative periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $335.5 million compared to $266.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we:\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> spent $349.7 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> received $2.0 million from assets sales; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> received $12.9 million as part of the assets acquired in the BRMR Merger.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> spent $275.6 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> spent $1.0 million on property and equipment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> received $10.4 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $86.2 million compared to $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we:\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> borrowed $97.5 million under our revolving credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> withheld from employees' shares totaling $6.7 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> paid $4.3 million of deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and amendment to the Credit Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> borrowed $32.5 million under our revolving credit facility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> withheld from employees shares totaling $1.3 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $225.1 million compared to $112.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs, which requires substantial capital expenditures. We periodically review capital expenditures and adjust our budget based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities, and commodity prices. We believe that our existing cash on hand, operating cash flow and available proceeds under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2020.\nFuture success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We will continue using net cash on hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds available under our revolving credit facility to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs, and as necessary, we will seek additional sources of debt or equity to fund these requirements. Longer-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices we receive for our production as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the natural gas and oil business. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales, joint venture transactions or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023. Further, based on our current forecast and activity levels, we expect to remain in compliance with all such debt covenants for the next twelve months. However, if oil and natural gas prices decrease to lower levels, we are likely to generate lower operating cash flows, which would make it more difficult for us to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants, including requirements with respect to working capital and interest coverage ratios. This could negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources.\nCredit Arrangements\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018, excluding discount, totaled $640.5 million and $543.0 million, respectively. Long-term debt includes both the senior unsecured notes outstanding and any outstanding borrowings against our revolving credit facility.\nInformation related to our credit arrangements is described in Note 9- Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the spot regional market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Pricing for natural gas, NGLs and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price.\nTo mitigate the potential negative impact on our cash flow caused by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, we may enter into financial commodity derivative contracts to ensure that we receive minimum prices for a portion of our future natural gas production when management believes that favorable future prices can be secured. We typically hedge the NYMEX Henry Hub price for natural gas, the WTI price for oil and a NGLs basket based on prices at Mont Belvieu, Texas.\nOur hedging activities are intended to support natural gas, NGLs and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations. The counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the floor price specified in the contract and the settlement price, which is based on market prices on the settlement date, if the settlement price is below the floor price. We are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the ceiling price and the settlement price if the ceiling price is below the settlement price. These contracts may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty, zero cost collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production, and puts which require us to pay a premium either up front or at settlement and allow us to receive a fixed price at our option if the put price is above the market price. Information regarding the derivative contracts we had entered into as of December 31, 2019 is set forth in Note 7- Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBy using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, we expose ourselves to the credit risk of our counterparties. Credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty is expected to owe us, which creates credit risk. To minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments, it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. The creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review. As of December 31, 2019, we had derivative instruments in place with Bank of Montreal, BP Energy Company, Capital One N.A., Citibank, Citizens Bank N.A., EDF Energy, J Aron, KeyBank N.A., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, and Wells Fargo. We believe all of such institutions currently are an acceptable credit risk. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any past due receivables from counterparties.\nCapital Requirements\nOur primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties and repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors recently approved an initial capital budget for 2020 of between approximately $190 - $210 million, allocated approximately 95% for drilling and completions activities and approximately 5% for land capital requirements. The 2020 capital budget is expected to be substantially funded through internally generated cash flows, the Company's current cash balance and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and\ncompetitive developments. A reduction in natural gas, NGLs or oil prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production and our proved reserves as well as our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. Our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of assets.\nIn addition, we may from time to time seek to pay down, retire or repurchase our outstanding debt using cash or through exchanges of other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on available funds, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions in our Credit Agreement and other factors.\nCapitalization\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our total debt, excluding debt discount and issuance costs, and capitalization were as follows (in millions):\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 510.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 510.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 997.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 687.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,637.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,230.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, firm transportation, gas processing, gathering and compressions services, and asset retirement obligations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have significant capital leases, any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 reflects accrued interest payable of $21.3 million, compared to $21.7 million as of December 31, 2018. We paid the accrued interest balance in January 2020.\nWe have a contract for the service of one rig, which expires in October 2021, with the option to extend. We have also entered into firm transportation agreements with various pipelines in order to facilitate the delivery of production to market. These contracts commit us to transport minimum daily natural gas volumes at a negotiated rate or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate. We have also agreed to certain minimum commitments under long-term gas processing and gathering agreements as well as various gas compression agreements. For additional discussion, see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Midstream Agreements\u201d.\nOther\nWe lease acreage that is generally subject to lease expiration if operations are not commenced within a specified period, generally 5 years and approximately 56% of our leases in the Utica Core Area have a 3-5 year extension at our option. Based on our evaluation of prospective economics, including the cost of infrastructure to connect production, we have allowed acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. To date, our expenditures to comply with environmental or safety regulations have not been a significant component of our cost structure and are not expected to be significant in the future. However, new regulations, enforcement policies, claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs.\nInterest Rates\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $510.5 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, excluding discounts, which bore interest at a fixed cash interest rate of 8.875%, due semi-annually from the date of issuance.\nInformation related to our interest rates is described in Note 9- Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments which are described above under -Cash Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nInflation and Changes in Prices\nOur revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, it does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs in fiscal 2020 to continue to be a function of supply and demand. Further strengthening of commodity prices could stimulate demand for ancillary services causing services costs to increase. In the near term, the majority of our service costs are expected to remain flat in 2020 due to previously negotiated drilling, stimulation, and rentals contracts. Along with these contacts, we have secured quality service equipment and tenured personnel to limit our exposure to increasing service costs and improve operational efficiencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year and proved natural gas and oil reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\nCertain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nNatural Gas and Oil Properties\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and oil producing activities. Unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed natural gas and oil reserves as estimated by our engineers and audited by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well; and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Proven property leasehold costs are amortized to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes.\nProved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are economically recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes\nexpected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, including the rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements which were adopted effective December 31, 2009, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in our depletion rates. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Executive Vice President, Resource Planning and Development who reports directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum engineers to prepare our estimates of proved reserves at least annually. SIS, our independent petroleum engineers for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, prepared 100% of our reserves in 2019 and 2018 and NSAI, our independent petroleum engineers, for all prior years, prepared 100% of our reserves in 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. For additional discussion, See Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Oil and Natural Gas Data-Proved Reserves\u201d.\nDepletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. While total depletion expense for the life of a property is limited to the property's total cost, proved reserve revisions result in a change in the timing of when depletion expense is recognized. Downward revisions of proved reserves may result in an acceleration of depletion expense, while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of depletion expense recognition. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from property asset groups, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to natural gas and oil producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 19- Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis.\nWe monitor our long-lived assets recorded in natural gas and oil properties in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves that will be produced from the property asset groups future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property asset group for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for natural gas, NGLs and/or oil, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts or environmental regulations. Our natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for potential impairments at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of other groups of assets. All of these factors must be considered when testing a property asset group carrying value for impairment.\nThe review is done by determining if the historical cost of proved and unproved properties less the applicable accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion is less than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The expected undiscounted future net cash flows are estimated based on our plans to produce and develop reserves. Expected undiscounted future net cash inflows from the sale of produced reserves are calculated based on estimated future prices and estimated operating and development costs. We estimate prices based upon market related information including published futures prices. The estimated future level of production, which is based on proved and risk adjusted probable reserves, has assumptions surrounding the future levels of prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates. In certain circumstances, we also consider potential sales of properties to third parties in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows. When the carrying value exceeds the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate similar to that used by market participants) and the carrying value of the asset. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future.\nWe believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impractical to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome. If natural gas, NGLs and oil prices decrease or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record additional impairments.\nWe evaluate our unproved property investment periodically for impairment. The majority of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leaseholds. The costs are capitalized and evaluated (at least quarterly) as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. Impairment of a significant portion of our unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. Potential impairment of individually significant unproved property is assessed on a property-by-property basis considering a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically pursue the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of natural gas and oil production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nInherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d), a corresponding adjustment is made to the natural gas and oil property balance. For example, as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment in formation, we may revise our estimate of current costs, the assumed annual inflation of the costs and/or the assumed productive lives of our wells. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nInformation related to revenue recognition is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation related to recent accounting pronouncements is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe are an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. On February 28, 2019, we completed a business combination (the BRMR Merger\u201d) with Blue Ridge Mountain Resources, Inc. ( BRMR\u201d), and immediately thereafter, we changed our legal name from Eclipse Resources Corporation\u201d to Montage Resources Corporation.\u201d Except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d as used herein refer, for periods prior to the completion of the BRMR Merger, to Eclipse Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries and, for periods following the completion of the BRMR Merger, to Montage Resources Corporation ( Montage\u201d) and its subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had assembled an acreage position approximating 233,800 net surface acres in Eastern Ohio, 38,700 net surface acres in Pennsylvania, and 49,700 net surface acres in West Virginia. Approximately 192,800 of our net acres are located in the Utica Shale fairway, which we refer to as the Utica Core Area, and approximately 55,300 net acres of stacked pay opportunity are also prospective for the highly liquids rich area of the Marcellus Shale in Eastern Ohio and West Virginia within what we refer to as our Marcellus Area. Additionally, we own approximately 74,100 net acres (which are approximately 80% held by production) outside of the Utica Core Area that may be prospective for the oil window of the Utica Shale.\nWe are the operator of approximately 98% of our net acreage within the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area. We intend to focus on developing our substantial inventory of horizontal drilling locations during commodity price environments that will allow us to generate attractive returns and will continue to opportunistically add to this acreage position where we can acquire acreage at attractive prices.\nOutside of the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area, we had 1,002 gross (975.3 net) conventional wells operated under multiple subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019.\nThe net assets of our subsidiary, Magnum Hunter Production, Inc. ( MHP\u201d), are classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale as of December 31, 2019. All operations of MHP are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 we were operating one horizontal rig; \n \u2022 we had 370 gross (235.7 net) wells within the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area, of which 1 gross (0.7 net) were drilling, 6 gross (5.2 net) were awaiting completion, and 363 gross (229.8 net) had been turned to sales; \n \u2022 we had average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately 547.8 MMcfe, which was comprised of approximately 77% natural gas, 14% NGLs and 9% oil; and \n \u2022 our estimated proved reserves were 2,729.8 Bcfe, or 455.0 MMBoe, based on reserve reports prepared by SIS, our independent petroleum engineers for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 55% of which were proved developed reserves. Our estimated proved reserves were approximately 78% natural gas, 15% NGLs and 7% oil, as of December 31, 2019. \nFactors That Significantly Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were derived approximately 57%, 13% and 23% from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil, respectively (with the remaining 7% of revenues primarily attributable to brokered natural gas and marketing revenue). Our revenues, cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices have historically been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions, supply and demand of hydrocarbons in the marketplace and geopolitical events such as wars or natural disasters. Sustained periods of low prices for these commodities would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations, the quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce and our ability to access capital.\nWe use commodity derivative instruments to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our production. These arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases, but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases. Our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over-the-counter commodity derivative contracts with large financial institutions. Additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts is set forth in Note 7- Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLike other businesses engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and natural gas production from a given well naturally decreases. Thus, an exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of reserves it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from our existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production in a cost-effective manner. Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from our existing reserves and to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to access capital in a cost-effective manner and to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals.\nOur financial condition and results of operations, including the growth of production, cash flows and reserves, are driven by several factors, including:\n \u2022 success in drilling new wells; \n \u2022 natural gas, NGLs and oil prices; \n \u2022 the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities and our ability to execute them; \n \u2022 the amount of capital we invest in the leasing and development of our properties; \n \u2022 facility or equipment availability and unexpected downtime; \n \u2022 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; and \n \u2022 the rate at which production volumes on our wells naturally decline. \nFactors That Significantly Affect Comparability of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, for the following reasons:\nDrilling Joint Venture. On December 22, 2017, we entered into definitive agreements with Sequel Energy Group LLC ( Sequel\u201d) (an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners LP) to establish a drilling joint venture on our Utica Shale acreage in Guernsey and Monroe counties in southeast Ohio. We have committed funding from Sequel of up to $285 million to fund its proportionate share of two drilling programs comprising of 33 gross wells in aggregate. We retained 50% of our pre-carry working interest in the first program and 30% of our pre-carry working interest in the second program. We received a 15% carried interest on drilling and completion capital expenditures incurred in each well program, which was proportionately reduced based upon our retained pre-carry working interest in such well program, and a significant portion of Sequel's working interest in each well program will revert to Montage once a certain return is realized by Sequel in each program. We are the operator of all wells drilled within each well program.\nFlat Castle Acquisition. On January 18, 2018, Eclipse Resources-PA, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its acquisition of certain oil and gas leases, wells and other oil and gas rights and interests covering approximately 44,500 net acres located in the counties of Tioga and Potter in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from Travis Peak. The aggregate adjusted purchase price for the Flat Castle Acquisition was $92.2 million, which was paid entirely with approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nBRMR Merger. On February 28, 2019, the Company completed its business combination transaction with Blue Ridge Mountain Resources, Inc. ( BRMR\u201d) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 25, 2018 and amended as of January 7, 2019 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, Everest Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d), and BRMR. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BRMR with BRMR continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the BRMR Merger\u201d).\nAs a result of the BRMR Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of BRMR issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the BRMR Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), excluding certain Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), was converted into the right to receive from the Company 0.29506 of a validly issued, fully-paid, and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The exchange ratio reflects an adjustment to account for the 15-to-1 reverse stock split described below. Former stockholders of BRMR received cash for any fractional shares of the Company's common stock to which they might have otherwise been entitled as a result of the BRMR Merger. In addition, upon completion of the BRMR Merger, all shares of BRMR restricted stock and all BRMR restricted stock units and performance interest awards were converted into the right to receive shares of common stock of the Company or cash, in each case as specified in the Merger Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split. Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time on February 28, 2019, the Company effected a 15-to-1 reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock. Holders of shares of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time received cash for any fractional shares of the Company's common stock to which they might have otherwise been entitled as a result of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split lowered the aggregate par value of the common stock reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity to reflect the reduced shares with the offset to additional paid-in-capital. All issued and outstanding share and per share amounts as of and for the periods prior to February 28, 2019 presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split in accordance with ASC 505 Equity\u201d.\nPlease see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Recent Developments\u201d for a description of other recent developments and transactions that may affect the comparability of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented to future periods.\nSource of Our Revenues\nSubstantially all of our historical revenues are derived from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil, and do not include the effects of derivatives. Revenues from product sales are a function of the volumes produced, prevailing market prices, product quality, gas Btu content and transportation costs. We generally sell production at a specific delivery point, pay transportation costs to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. We record transportation costs as transportation, gathering and compression expense. We also may derive revenue from brokered gas or revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not related to our production and from the release of firm transportation capacity, which we refer to as brokered natural gas and marketing revenue. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.\nPrincipal Components of Our Cost Structure\n \u2022 Lease operating. These are day-to-day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground along with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs include compensation of our field employees, maintenance, repairs and workovers expenses related to our natural gas and oil properties. \n \u2022 Transportation, gathering and compression. These are costs incurred to bring natural gas, NGLs, and oil to the market. Such costs include the costs to operate and maintain our low- and high-pressure gathering and compression systems as well as fees paid to third parties who operate gathering systems that transport our gas. They also include costs to process and extract NGLs from our produced gas and to transport our NGLs and oil to market. We often enter into fixed price long-term contracts that secure transportation and processing capacity which may include minimum volume commitments, the cost for which is included in these expenses to the extent that they are not excess capacity. \n \u2022 Production and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on a percentage of market prices or at fixed rates established by the applicable federal, state or local taxing authorities. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on reserve values at the end of each year. \n \u2022 Brokered natural gas and marketing. These expenses are gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. \n \u2022 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. This includes the expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas, NGLs and oil. As a successful efforts company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts, and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This also includes the monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells, service assets, pipelines and other facilities. \n \u2022 Exploration. These are geological and geophysical costs, seismic costs, delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes. This category also includes unproved property impairment and expenses associated with lease expirations. \n \u2022 General and administrative. These costs include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance. Included in this category are any overhead expense reimbursements we receive from working interest owners of properties, for which we serve as the operator. These reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property's life. \n \u2022 Impairment of oil and gas properties. Properties are evaluated for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. When the carrying value exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair market value and carrying value of the asset. \n \u2022 Gain (loss) on derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of gas. None of our derivative contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, our derivative contracts are marked-to-market each quarter with changes in fair value recognized currently as a gain or loss in our results of operations. The amount of future gain or loss recognized on derivative instruments is dependent upon future gas prices, which will affect the value of the contracts. Cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty. In addition to gains and losses recognized from changes in fair value of the derivative instruments, gain (loss) on derivative instruments includes actual amounts realized from settlement of derivative instruments upon expiration. \n \u2022 Interest expense. We have historically financed a portion of our cash requirements with proceeds from fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by our financing decisions. \nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nIn evaluating our current and future financial results, we focus on production and revenue growth, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense (both before and after non-cash stock compensation expense) and operating margin per unit of production. In addition to these metrics, we use Adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure, to evaluate our financial results. Adjusted EBITDAX\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) before interest expense or interest income; income taxes; write-down of abandoned leases; impairments; depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d); amortization of deferred financing costs; gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net cash receipts (payments) on settled derivative instruments, and premiums (paid) received on options that settled during the period; non-cash compensation expense; gain or loss from sale of interest in gas properties; exploration expenses; and other unusual or infrequent items. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used and defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX provides no information regarding a company's capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, and working capital movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDAX does not represent funds available for discretionary use because those funds may be required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, income taxes, franchise taxes, exploration expenses, and other commitments and obligations.\nIn addition to the operating metrics above, as we grow our reserve base, we will assess our capital spending by calculating our operated proved developed reserves and our operated proved developed finding costs and development costs. We believe that operated proved developed finding and development costs are one of the key measurements of the performance of an oil and gas exploration and production company. We will focus on our operated properties as we control the location, spending and operations associated with drilling these properties. In determining our proved developed finding and development costs, only cash costs incurred in connection with exploration and development will be used in the calculation, while the costs of acquisitions will be excluded because our Board of Directors approves each material acquisition. In evaluating our proved developed reserve additions, any reserve revisions for changes in commodity prices between years will be excluded from the assessment, but any performance related reserve revisions are included.\nWe also continually evaluate our rates of return on invested capital in our wells. These rates of return calculations may include corporate level items such as land costs, general and administrative expenses, midstream costs and cash settled derivatives. We believe the quality of our assets combined with our technical and managerial expertise can generate attractive rates of return as we develop our acreage in the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area. We review changes in drilling and completion costs, lease operating costs, natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, well productivity, and other factors in order to focus our drilling on the highest rate of return areas within our acreage on a per well basis.\nAs a result of the closing of the BRMR Merger on February 28, 2019, BRMR's assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 and BRMR's revenues and expenses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. (See Note 3- Acquisition).\nOverview of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Results\nOperationally, our performance during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects continued development of our acreage, while focusing on capital preservation in the current commodity price environment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we achieved the following financial and operating results:\n \u2022 increased our average daily net production for the year ended December 31, 2019 by 60% over the prior year, to 547.8 MMcfe per day; \n \u2022 commenced drilling 32 gross (28.2 net) operated wells, commenced completions of 36 gross (30.0 net) operated wells and turned-to-sales 39 gross (30.8 net) operated wells during the year ended December 31, 2019; \n \u2022 recognized net income of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; and \n \u2022 realized Adjusted EBITDAX of $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $261.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d for more information. \nMarket Conditions\nPrices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices for commodities, such as hydrocarbons, are inherently volatile. The following table lists average daily, high, low and average monthly settled NYMEX Henry Hub prices for natural gas and average daily, high and low NYMEX WTI prices for oil for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NYMEX Henry Hub High ($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NYMEX Henry Hub Low ($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Daily NYMEX Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Settled NYMEX Henry Hub\n($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NYMEX WTI High ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NYMEX WTI Low ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Daily NYMEX WTI ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHistorically, commodity prices have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future. A decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. We make price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of our cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancelable capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, our financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.\nThe Company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves through an environmentally responsible and cost-effective operational plan. The Company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company's ability to develop its reserves. Despite the continued low price commodity environment, the Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company's resource base, low cost structure, risk management strategies, and disciplined investment of capital.\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact of changes in future commodity prices on our reported estimated net proved reserves with any degree of certainty because of the various components and assumptions used in the process. However, the below sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of a 10% increase and decrease in commodity pricing to our reserves assuming all other inputs remain constant.\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Natural Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated Proved Reserves (Bcfe)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Discounted Future\nNet Cash Flows (PV-10)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity Pricing - SEC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,729.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,470.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reserves Sensitivity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,812.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,896.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,387.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,064.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure.

To the extent there is a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices in the future, we will assess the impact on our development plan at that time, and we may respond to such changes by altering our capital budget or our development plan. We plan to fund our development budget with a portion of the cash on hand at December 31, 2019, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from asset sales.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion pertains to our results of operations, including analysis of our continuing operations regarding natural gas, NGLs and oil revenues, production, average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

was $42.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Brokered natural gas and marketing revenue includes revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not related to our production and from the release of firm transportation capacity. The increase from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to an increase in the amount of natural gas that was available for brokered gas transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per Mcfe, basis.

Lease operating expense per Mcfe was $0.22 in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.23 in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $15.1 million was primarily attributable to an increase in producing wells during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.01 per Mcfe was primarily due to a decrease in non-recurring workovers and fixed costs spread across increased production for the year ended December 31, 2019. Lease operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate our wells and non-recurring workovers and repairs.\nTransportation, gathering and compression expense was $208.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $138.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease of $0.06 per Mcfe was primarily due to a higher percentage of production attributable to natural gas and fixed firm transportation costs spread across increased production during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and applicable tax rates. Production and ad valorem taxes were $12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Production and ad valorem taxes per Mcfe was $0.06 in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.08 in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $2.0 million in aggregate production and ad valorem taxes was primarily due to increased production and well count. The decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe was primarily due to the recognition of a refund for production taxes from a state taxing authority during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was approximately $156.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $134.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This $21.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in production and proved property costs during the year ended December 31, 2019. On a per Mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $0.77 in the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1.07 in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to a lower depletion rate resulting from our reserves increasing at a higher rate than our capital costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.35 in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase of $26.5 million was primarily related to approximately $21.5 million of expenses related to the BRMR Merger incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Expenses were consistent on a per Mcfe basis due to the increase in expenses being offset by increased production for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense includes $8.8 million and $7.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production.

Brokered natural gas and marketing expense relate to gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of natural gas that was available for brokered gas transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nExploration expense was $58.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $49.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease in delay rentals related to the reduction in future drilling activity and focusing renewals in our core acreage during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment of unproved properties was $45.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 was the result of an increase in expected lease expirations due to a reduction in planned future drilling activity. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current commodity price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.\nRig termination and standby expense was $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the reduction in development activity. There was no rig termination and standby expense in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of assets was $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, each due to the sale of certain non-core assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments was $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to ($21.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to changes in commodity prices during each year. Cash receipts (payments) were approximately $20.3 million and ($27.0) million for the derivative instruments that settled during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest expense, net was $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $54.0 million for year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our increased borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was not recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to the Company recording a higher valuation allowance related to its pre-tax losses and reducing the valuation allowance to the extent of pre-tax income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNatural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations\nThe following table illustrates the revenue attributable to our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGLs sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered natural gas and marketing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 515,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 383,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur production grew by approximately 11.8 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2018 over the year ended December 31, 2017, as we placed new wells into production, partially offset by natural declines in well production.

These expenses were consistent on a per unit basis as increased firm transportation and production costs were offset by lower contractual gathering rates.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and applicable tax rates. Production and ad valorem taxes were $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Production and ad valorem taxes per Mcfe was $0.08 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.07 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The $1.6 million increase in aggregate production and ad valorem taxes was primarily due to increased production and well count. The increase of $0.01 on a per unit basis was driven by increased severance taxes associated with our increased liquids production.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was approximately $134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $119.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This $15.6 million increase was primarily due to an increase in production and proved property costs. On a per Mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $1.07 in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1.05 in the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily due to a higher depletion rate resulting from our reserves increasing at a lower rate than our capital cost.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.35 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.39 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The $0.2 million decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and benefits associated with decreased head count, and lower professional fees partially offset by approximately $4.0 million of expense related to the BRMR Merger. The decrease of $0.04 per Mcfe was primarily due to fixed costs spread across increased levels of production as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. General and administrative expense includes $7.9 million and $9.3 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration, rig termination and standby and (gain) loss on sale of assets. The following table details our other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered natural gas and marketing expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exploration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (645\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig termination and standby\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,815\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,636\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrokered natural gas and marketing expense was $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense relate to gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of firm transportation that was available for brokered gas transactions or release to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nExploration expense decreased to $49.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exploration expenses (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Geological and geophysical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Delay rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of unproved properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (683\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dry hole and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,410\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (645\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDelay rentals were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in delay rentals related to converting future lump-sum extension payments into annual delay rentals.\nImpairment of unproved properties was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a decrease in expected lease expirations due to the increase in our planned future drilling activity. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current commodity price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.\nRig termination and standby expense was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was no rig termination and standby expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of assets was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, each due to the sale of certain non-core assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments was ($21.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to changes in commodity prices during each year. Cash payments were approximately $27.0 million and $2.2 million for the derivative instruments that settled during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest expense, net was $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $49.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was not recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to the Company recording a higher valuation allowance related to its pre-tax losses and reducing the valuation allowance to the extent of pre-tax income.\nCash Flows, Capital Resources and Liquidity\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by our operating cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity securities. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $255.4 million compared to $225.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash provided from operating activities reflects working capital changes, operating income, timing of cash receipts and disbursements and the increase in our production during the year-over-year comparative periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $335.5 million compared to $266.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we:\n \u2022 spent $349.7 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 received $2.0 million from assets sales; and \n \u2022 received $12.9 million as part of the assets acquired in the BRMR Merger. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 spent $275.6 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 spent $1.0 million on property and equipment; and \n \u2022 received $10.4 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets. \nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $86.2 million compared to $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we:\n \u2022 borrowed $97.5 million under our revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 withheld from employees' shares totaling $6.7 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards; and \n \u2022 paid $4.3 million of deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and amendment to the Credit Agreement. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 borrowed $32.5 million under our revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 withheld from employees shares totaling $1.3 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $225.1 million compared to $112.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash provided from operating activities reflects working capital changes, operating income and the timing of cash receipts and disbursements during the year-over-year comparative periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $266.3 million compared to $292.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 spent $275.6 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 spent $1.0 million on property and equipment; and \n \u2022 received $10.4 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we:\n \u2022 spent $291.8 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 spent $2.0 million on property and equipment; and \n \u2022 received $1.3 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets. \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.9 million compared to ($4.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 borrowed $32.5 million under our revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 withheld from employees shares totaling $1.3 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we:\n \u2022 paid $1.8 million in financing costs associated with an amendment to the Credit Agreement that, among other things, increased the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 withheld from employees' shares totaling $2.0 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, asset sales, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets. We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs, which requires substantial capital expenditures. We periodically review capital expenditures and adjust our budget based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities, and commodity prices. We believe that our existing cash on hand, operating cash flow and available proceeds under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2020.\nFuture success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We will continue using net cash on hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds available under our revolving credit facility to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs, and as necessary, we will seek additional sources of debt or equity to fund these requirements. Longer-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices we receive for our production as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the natural gas and oil business. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales, joint venture transactions or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023. Further, based on our current forecast and activity levels, we expect to remain in compliance with all such debt covenants for the next twelve months. However, if oil and natural gas prices decrease to lower levels, we are likely to generate lower operating cash flows, which would make it more difficult for us to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants, including requirements with respect to working capital and interest coverage ratios. This could negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources.\nCredit Arrangements\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018, excluding discount, totaled $640.5 million and $543.0 million, respectively. Long-term debt includes both the senior unsecured notes outstanding and any outstanding borrowings against our revolving credit facility.\nInformation related to our credit arrangements is described in Note 9- Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the spot regional market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Pricing for natural gas, NGLs and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price.\nTo mitigate the potential negative impact on our cash flow caused by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, we may enter into financial commodity derivative contracts to ensure that we receive minimum prices for a portion of our future natural gas production when management believes that favorable future prices can be secured. We typically hedge the NYMEX Henry Hub price for natural gas, the WTI price for oil and a NGLs basket based on prices at Mont Belvieu, Texas.\nOur hedging activities are intended to support natural gas, NGLs and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations. The counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the floor price specified in the contract and the settlement price, which is based on market prices on the settlement date, if the settlement price is below the floor price. We are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the ceiling price and the settlement price if the ceiling price is below the settlement price. These contracts may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty, zero cost collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production, and puts which require us to pay a premium either up front or at settlement and allow us to receive a fixed price at our option if the put price is above the market price. Information regarding the derivative contracts we had entered into as of December 31, 2019 is set forth in Note 7- Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBy using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, we expose ourselves to the credit risk of our counterparties. Credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty is expected to owe us, which creates credit risk. To minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments, it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. The creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review. As of December 31, 2019, we had derivative instruments in place with Bank of Montreal, BP Energy Company, Capital One N.A., Citibank, Citizens Bank N.A., EDF Energy, J Aron, KeyBank N.A., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, and Wells Fargo. We believe all of such institutions currently are an acceptable credit risk. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any past due receivables from counterparties.\nCapital Requirements\nOur primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties and repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors recently approved an initial capital budget for 2020 of between approximately $190 - $210 million, allocated approximately 95% for drilling and completions activities and approximately 5% for land capital requirements. The 2020 capital budget is expected to be substantially funded through internally generated cash flows, the Company's current cash balance and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and\ncompetitive developments. A reduction in natural gas, NGLs or oil prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production and our proved reserves as well as our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. Our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of assets.\nIn addition, we may from time to time seek to pay down, retire or repurchase our outstanding debt using cash or through exchanges of other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on available funds, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions in our Credit Agreement and other factors.\nCapitalization\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our total debt, excluding debt discount and issuance costs, and capitalization were as follows (in millions):\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 510.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 510.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 997.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 687.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,637.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,230.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, firm transportation, gas processing, gathering and compressions services, and asset retirement obligations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have significant capital leases, any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 reflects accrued interest payable of $21.3 million, compared to $21.7 million as of December 31, 2018. We paid the accrued interest balance in January 2020.\nWe have a contract for the service of one rig, which expires in October 2021, with the option to extend. We have also entered into firm transportation agreements with various pipelines in order to facilitate the delivery of production to market. These contracts commit us to transport minimum daily natural gas volumes at a negotiated rate or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate. We have also agreed to certain minimum commitments under long-term gas processing and gathering agreements as well as various gas compression agreements. For additional discussion, see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Midstream Agreements\u201d.\nOther\nWe lease acreage that is generally subject to lease expiration if operations are not commenced within a specified period, generally 5 years and approximately 56% of our leases in the Utica Core Area have a 3-5 year extension at our option. Based on our evaluation of prospective economics, including the cost of infrastructure to connect production, we have allowed acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. To date, our expenditures to comply with environmental or safety regulations have not been a significant component of our cost structure and are not expected to be significant in the future. However, new regulations, enforcement policies, claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs.\nInterest Rates\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $510.5 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, excluding discounts, which bore interest at a fixed cash interest rate of 8.875%, due semi-annually from the date of issuance.\nInformation related to our interest rates is described in Note 9- Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments which are described above under -Cash Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nInflation and Changes in Prices\nOur revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, it does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs in fiscal 2020 to continue to be a function of supply and demand. Further strengthening of commodity prices could stimulate demand for ancillary services causing services costs to increase. In the near term, the majority of our service costs are expected to remain flat in 2020 due to previously negotiated drilling, stimulation, and rentals contracts. Along with these contacts, we have secured quality service equipment and tenured personnel to limit our exposure to increasing service costs and improve operational efficiencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year and proved natural gas and oil reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\nCertain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nNatural Gas and Oil Properties\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and oil producing activities. Unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed natural gas and oil reserves as estimated by our engineers and audited by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well; and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Proven property leasehold costs are amortized to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes.\nProved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are economically recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes\nexpected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, including the rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements which were adopted effective December 31, 2009, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in our depletion rates. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Executive Vice President, Resource Planning and Development who reports directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum engineers to prepare our estimates of proved reserves at least annually. SIS, our independent petroleum engineers for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, prepared 100% of our reserves in 2019 and 2018 and NSAI, our independent petroleum engineers, for all prior years, prepared 100% of our reserves in 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. For additional discussion, See Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Oil and Natural Gas Data-Proved Reserves\u201d.\nDepletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. While total depletion expense for the life of a property is limited to the property's total cost, proved reserve revisions result in a change in the timing of when depletion expense is recognized. Downward revisions of proved reserves may result in an acceleration of depletion expense, while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of depletion expense recognition. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from property asset groups, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to natural gas and oil producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 19- Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis.\nWe monitor our long-lived assets recorded in natural gas and oil properties in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves that will be produced from the property asset groups future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property asset group for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for natural gas, NGLs and/or oil, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts or environmental regulations. Our natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for potential impairments at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of other groups of assets. All of these factors must be considered when testing a property asset group carrying value for impairment.\nThe review is done by determining if the historical cost of proved and unproved properties less the applicable accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion is less than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The expected undiscounted future net cash flows are estimated based on our plans to produce and develop reserves. Expected undiscounted future net cash inflows from the sale of produced reserves are calculated based on estimated future prices and estimated operating and development costs. We estimate prices based upon market related information including published futures prices. The estimated future level of production, which is based on proved and risk adjusted probable reserves, has assumptions surrounding the future levels of prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates. In certain circumstances, we also consider potential sales of properties to third parties in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows. When the carrying value exceeds the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate similar to that used by market participants) and the carrying value of the asset. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future.\nWe believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impractical to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome. If natural gas, NGLs and oil prices decrease or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record additional impairments.\nWe evaluate our unproved property investment periodically for impairment. The majority of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leaseholds. The costs are capitalized and evaluated (at least quarterly) as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. Impairment of a significant portion of our unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. Potential impairment of individually significant unproved property is assessed on a property-by-property basis considering a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically pursue the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of natural gas and oil production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nInherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d), a corresponding adjustment is made to the natural gas and oil property balance. For example, as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment in formation, we may revise our estimate of current costs, the assumed annual inflation of the costs and/or the assumed productive lives of our wells. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nInformation related to revenue recognition is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation related to recent accounting pronouncements is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe are an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. On February 28, 2019, we completed a business combination (the BRMR Merger\u201d) with Blue Ridge Mountain Resources, Inc. ( BRMR\u201d), and immediately thereafter, we changed our legal name from Eclipse Resources Corporation\u201d to Montage Resources Corporation.\u201d Except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d as used herein refer, for periods prior to the completion of the BRMR Merger, to Eclipse Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries and, for periods following the completion of the BRMR Merger, to Montage Resources Corporation ( Montage\u201d) and its subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had assembled an acreage position approximating 233,800 net surface acres in Eastern Ohio, 38,700 net surface acres in Pennsylvania, and 49,700 net surface acres in West Virginia. Approximately 192,800 of our net acres are located in the Utica Shale fairway, which we refer to as the Utica Core Area, and approximately 55,300 net acres of stacked pay opportunity are also prospective for the highly liquids rich area of the Marcellus Shale in Eastern Ohio and West Virginia within what we refer to as our Marcellus Area. Additionally, we own approximately 74,100 net acres (which are approximately 80% held by production) outside of the Utica Core Area that may be prospective for the oil window of the Utica Shale.\nWe are the operator of approximately 98% of our net acreage within the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area. We intend to focus on developing our substantial inventory of horizontal drilling locations during commodity price environments that will allow us to generate attractive returns and will continue to opportunistically add to this acreage position where we can acquire acreage at attractive prices.\nOutside of the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area, we had 1,002 gross (975.3 net) conventional wells operated under multiple subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019.\nThe net assets of our subsidiary, Magnum Hunter Production, Inc. ( MHP\u201d), are classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale as of December 31, 2019. All operations of MHP are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 we were operating one horizontal rig; \n \u2022 we had 370 gross (235.7 net) wells within the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area, of which 1 gross (0.7 net) were drilling, 6 gross (5.2 net) were awaiting completion, and 363 gross (229.8 net) had been turned to sales; \n \u2022 we had average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately 547.8 MMcfe, which was comprised of approximately 77% natural gas, 14% NGLs and 9% oil; and \n \u2022 our estimated proved reserves were 2,729.8 Bcfe, or 455.0 MMBoe, based on reserve reports prepared by SIS, our independent petroleum engineers for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 55% of which were proved developed reserves. Our estimated proved reserves were approximately 78% natural gas, 15% NGLs and 7% oil, as of December 31, 2019. \nFactors That Significantly Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were derived approximately 57%, 13% and 23% from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil, respectively (with the remaining 7% of revenues primarily attributable to brokered natural gas and marketing revenue). Our revenues, cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices have historically been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions, supply and demand of hydrocarbons in the marketplace and geopolitical events such as wars or natural disasters. Sustained periods of low prices for these commodities would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations, the quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce and our ability to access capital.\nWe use commodity derivative instruments to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our production. These arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases, but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases. Our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over-the-counter commodity derivative contracts with large financial institutions. Additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts is set forth in Note 7- Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLike other businesses engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and natural gas production from a given well naturally decreases. Thus, an exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of reserves it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from our existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production in a cost-effective manner. Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from our existing reserves and to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to access capital in a cost-effective manner and to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals.\nOur financial condition and results of operations, including the growth of production, cash flows and reserves, are driven by several factors, including:\n \u2022 success in drilling new wells; \n \u2022 natural gas, NGLs and oil prices; \n \u2022 the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities and our ability to execute them; \n \u2022 the amount of capital we invest in the leasing and development of our properties; \n \u2022 facility or equipment availability and unexpected downtime; \n \u2022 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; and \n \u2022 the rate at which production volumes on our wells naturally decline. \nFactors That Significantly Affect Comparability of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, for the following reasons:\nDrilling Joint Venture. On December 22, 2017, we entered into definitive agreements with Sequel Energy Group LLC ( Sequel\u201d) (an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners LP) to establish a drilling joint venture on our Utica Shale acreage in Guernsey and Monroe counties in southeast Ohio. We have committed funding from Sequel of up to $285 million to fund its proportionate share of two drilling programs comprising of 33 gross wells in aggregate. We retained 50% of our pre-carry working interest in the first program and 30% of our pre-carry working interest in the second program. We received a 15% carried interest on drilling and completion capital expenditures incurred in each well program, which was proportionately reduced based upon our retained pre-carry working interest in such well program, and a significant portion of Sequel's working interest in each well program will revert to Montage once a certain return is realized by Sequel in each program. We are the operator of all wells drilled within each well program.\nFlat Castle Acquisition. On January 18, 2018, Eclipse Resources-PA, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its acquisition of certain oil and gas leases, wells and other oil and gas rights and interests covering approximately 44,500 net acres located in the counties of Tioga and Potter in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from Travis Peak. The aggregate adjusted purchase price for the Flat Castle Acquisition was $92.2 million, which was paid entirely with approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nBRMR Merger. On February 28, 2019, the Company completed its business combination transaction with Blue Ridge Mountain Resources, Inc. ( BRMR\u201d) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 25, 2018 and amended as of January 7, 2019 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, Everest Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d), and BRMR. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BRMR with BRMR continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the BRMR Merger\u201d).\nAs a result of the BRMR Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of BRMR issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the BRMR Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), excluding certain Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), was converted into the right to receive from the Company 0.29506 of a validly issued, fully-paid, and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The exchange ratio reflects an adjustment to account for the 15-to-1 reverse stock split described below. Former stockholders of BRMR received cash for any fractional shares of the Company's common stock to which they might have otherwise been entitled as a result of the BRMR Merger. In addition, upon completion of the BRMR Merger, all shares of BRMR restricted stock and all BRMR restricted stock units and performance interest awards were converted into the right to receive shares of common stock of the Company or cash, in each case as specified in the Merger Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split. Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time on February 28, 2019, the Company effected a 15-to-1 reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock. Holders of shares of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time received cash for any fractional shares of the Company's common stock to which they might have otherwise been entitled as a result of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split lowered the aggregate par value of the common stock reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity to reflect the reduced shares with the offset to additional paid-in-capital. All issued and outstanding share and per share amounts as of and for the periods prior to February 28, 2019 presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split in accordance with ASC 505 Equity\u201d.\nPlease see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Recent Developments\u201d for a description of other recent developments and transactions that may affect the comparability of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented to future periods.\nSource of Our Revenues\nSubstantially all of our historical revenues are derived from the production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil, and do not include the effects of derivatives. Revenues from product sales are a function of the volumes produced, prevailing market prices, product quality, gas Btu content and transportation costs. We generally sell production at a specific delivery point, pay transportation costs to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. We record transportation costs as transportation, gathering and compression expense. We also may derive revenue from brokered gas or revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not related to our production and from the release of firm transportation capacity, which we refer to as brokered natural gas and marketing revenue. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.\nPrincipal Components of Our Cost Structure\n \u2022 Lease operating. These are day-to-day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground along with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs include compensation of our field employees, maintenance, repairs and workovers expenses related to our natural gas and oil properties. \n \u2022 Transportation, gathering and compression. These are costs incurred to bring natural gas, NGLs, and oil to the market. Such costs include the costs to operate and maintain our low- and high-pressure gathering and compression systems as well as fees paid to third parties who operate gathering systems that transport our gas. They also include costs to process and extract NGLs from our produced gas and to transport our NGLs and oil to market. We often enter into fixed price long-term contracts that secure transportation and processing capacity which may include minimum volume commitments, the cost for which is included in these expenses to the extent that they are not excess capacity. \n \u2022 Production and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on a percentage of market prices or at fixed rates established by the applicable federal, state or local taxing authorities. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on reserve values at the end of each year. \n \u2022 Brokered natural gas and marketing. These expenses are gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. \n \u2022 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. This includes the expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas, NGLs and oil. As a successful efforts company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts, and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This also includes the monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells, service assets, pipelines and other facilities. \n \u2022 Exploration. These are geological and geophysical costs, seismic costs, delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes. This category also includes unproved property impairment and expenses associated with lease expirations. \n \u2022 General and administrative. These costs include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance. Included in this category are any overhead expense reimbursements we receive from working interest owners of properties, for which we serve as the operator. These reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property's life. \n \u2022 Impairment of oil and gas properties. Properties are evaluated for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. When the carrying value exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair market value and carrying value of the asset. \n \u2022 Gain (loss) on derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of gas. None of our derivative contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, our derivative contracts are marked-to-market each quarter with changes in fair value recognized currently as a gain or loss in our results of operations. The amount of future gain or loss recognized on derivative instruments is dependent upon future gas prices, which will affect the value of the contracts. Cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty. In addition to gains and losses recognized from changes in fair value of the derivative instruments, gain (loss) on derivative instruments includes actual amounts realized from settlement of derivative instruments upon expiration. \n \u2022 Interest expense. We have historically financed a portion of our cash requirements with proceeds from fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by our financing decisions. \nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nIn evaluating our current and future financial results, we focus on production and revenue growth, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense (both before and after non-cash stock compensation expense) and operating margin per unit of production. In addition to these metrics, we use Adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure, to evaluate our financial results. Adjusted EBITDAX\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) before interest expense or interest income; income taxes; write-down of abandoned leases; impairments; depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d); amortization of deferred financing costs; gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net cash receipts (payments) on settled derivative instruments, and premiums (paid) received on options that settled during the period; non-cash compensation expense; gain or loss from sale of interest in gas properties; exploration expenses; and other unusual or infrequent items. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used and defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX provides no information regarding a company's capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, and working capital movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDAX does not represent funds available for discretionary use because those funds may be required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, income taxes, franchise taxes, exploration expenses, and other commitments and obligations.\nIn addition to the operating metrics above, as we grow our reserve base, we will assess our capital spending by calculating our operated proved developed reserves and our operated proved developed finding costs and development costs. We believe that operated proved developed finding and development costs are one of the key measurements of the performance of an oil and gas exploration and production company. We will focus on our operated properties as we control the location, spending and operations associated with drilling these properties. In determining our proved developed finding and development costs, only cash costs incurred in connection with exploration and development will be used in the calculation, while the costs of acquisitions will be excluded because our Board of Directors approves each material acquisition. In evaluating our proved developed reserve additions, any reserve revisions for changes in commodity prices between years will be excluded from the assessment, but any performance related reserve revisions are included.\nWe also continually evaluate our rates of return on invested capital in our wells. These rates of return calculations may include corporate level items such as land costs, general and administrative expenses, midstream costs and cash settled derivatives. We believe the quality of our assets combined with our technical and managerial expertise can generate attractive rates of return as we develop our acreage in the Utica Core Area and our Marcellus Area. We review changes in drilling and completion costs, lease operating costs, natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, well productivity, and other factors in order to focus our drilling on the highest rate of return areas within our acreage on a per well basis.\nAs a result of the closing of the BRMR Merger on February 28, 2019, BRMR's assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 and BRMR's revenues and expenses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. (See Note 3- Acquisition).\nOverview of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Results\nOperationally, our performance during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects continued development of our acreage, while focusing on capital preservation in the current commodity price environment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we achieved the following financial and operating results:\n \u2022 increased our average daily net production for the year ended December 31, 2019 by 60% over the prior year, to 547.8 MMcfe per day; \n \u2022 commenced drilling 32 gross (28.2 net) operated wells, commenced completions of 36 gross (30.0 net) operated wells and turned-to-sales 39 gross (30.8 net) operated wells during the year ended December 31, 2019; \n \u2022 recognized net income of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; and \n \u2022 realized Adjusted EBITDAX of $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $261.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d for more information. \nMarket Conditions\nPrices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices for commodities, such as hydrocarbons, are inherently volatile. The following table lists average daily, high, low and average monthly settled NYMEX Henry Hub prices for natural gas and average daily, high and low NYMEX WTI prices for oil for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\nHistorically, commodity prices have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future. A decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. We make price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of our cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancelable capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, our financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.\nThe Company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves through an environmentally responsible and cost-effective operational plan. The Company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company's ability to develop its reserves. Despite the continued low price commodity environment, the Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company's resource base, low cost structure, risk management strategies, and disciplined investment of capital.\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact of changes in future commodity prices on our reported estimated net proved reserves with any degree of certainty because of the various components and assumptions used in the process. However, the below sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of a 10% increase and decrease in commodity pricing to our reserves assuming all other inputs remain constant.\n\n (1) PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of PV-10 to standardized measure, please see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Oil and Natural Gas Data- Proved Reserves Additions and Revisions.\u201d \nWe consider future commodity prices when determining our development plan, but many other factors are also considered. To the extent there is a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices in the future, we will assess the impact on our development plan at that time, and we may respond to such changes by altering our capital budget or our development plan. We plan to fund our development budget with a portion of the cash on hand at December 31, 2019, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from asset sales.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion pertains to our results of operations, including analysis of our continuing operations regarding natural gas, NGLs and oil revenues, production, average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. The results of operations of MHP are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNatural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations\nThe following table illustrates the revenue attributable to our operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nOur production grew by approximately 74.7 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2019 over the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased drilling activity and from wells acquired as part of the BRMR Merger. Our production for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is set forth in the following table:\n\nOur average realized price (including cash settled derivatives and firm transportation) received during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.70 per Mcfe compared to $3.37 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2018. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices of production volumes should include the total impact of firm transportation expense. Our average realized price (including all cash settled derivatives and firm transportation) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized price (excluding cash settled derivatives and firm transportation) does not include derivative settlements or firm transportation, which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Average realized price (including firm transportation and excluding cash settled derivatives) does include firm transportation where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers. Average realized price calculations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown below:\n\nBrokered natural gas and marketing revenue was $42.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Brokered natural gas and marketing revenue includes revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not related to our production and from the release of firm transportation capacity. The increase from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to an increase in the amount of natural gas that was available for brokered gas transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per Mcfe, basis. The following table presents information about certain of our expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nLease operating expense was $43.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Lease operating expense per Mcfe was $0.22 in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.23 in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $15.1 million was primarily attributable to an increase in producing wells during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.01 per Mcfe was primarily due to a decrease in non-recurring workovers and fixed costs spread across increased production for the year ended December 31, 2019. Lease operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate our wells and non-recurring workovers and repairs.\nTransportation, gathering and compression expense was $208.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $138.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Transportation, gathering and compression expense per Mcfe was $1.04 in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.10 in the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table details our transportation, gathering and compression expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nThe increase of $70.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to increased production and increased firm transportation capacity. The decrease of $0.06 per Mcfe was primarily due to a higher percentage of production attributable to natural gas and fixed firm transportation costs spread across increased production during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and applicable tax rates. Production and ad valorem taxes were $12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Production and ad valorem taxes per Mcfe was $0.06 in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.08 in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $2.0 million in aggregate production and ad valorem taxes was primarily due to increased production and well count. The decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe was primarily due to the recognition of a refund for production taxes from a state taxing authority during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was approximately $156.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $134.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This $21.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in production and proved property costs during the year ended December 31, 2019. On a per Mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $0.77 in the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1.07 in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to a lower depletion rate resulting from our reserves increasing at a higher rate than our capital costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.35 in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase of $26.5 million was primarily related to approximately $21.5 million of expenses related to the BRMR Merger incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Expenses were consistent on a per Mcfe basis due to the increase in expenses being offset by increased production for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense includes $8.8 million and $7.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration, rig termination and standby and (gain) loss on sale of assets. The following table details our other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBrokered natural gas and marketing expense was $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense relate to gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of natural gas that was available for brokered gas transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nExploration expense was $58.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $49.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nDelay rentals was $10.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $19.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in delay rentals related to the reduction in future drilling activity and focusing renewals in our core acreage during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment of unproved properties was $45.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 was the result of an increase in expected lease expirations due to a reduction in planned future drilling activity. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current commodity price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.\nRig termination and standby expense was $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the reduction in development activity. There was no rig termination and standby expense in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of assets was $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, each due to the sale of certain non-core assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments was $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to ($21.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to changes in commodity prices during each year. Cash receipts (payments) were approximately $20.3 million and ($27.0) million for the derivative instruments that settled during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest expense, net was $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $54.0 million for year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our increased borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was not recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to the Company recording a higher valuation allowance related to its pre-tax losses and reducing the valuation allowance to the extent of pre-tax income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNatural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations\nThe following table illustrates the revenue attributable to our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nOur production grew by approximately 11.8 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2018 over the year ended December 31, 2017, as we placed new wells into production, partially offset by natural declines in well production. Our production for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is set forth in the following table:\n\nOur average realized price (including cash settled derivatives and firm transportation) received during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.37 per Mcfe compared to $2.99 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2017. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices of production volumes should include the total impact of firm transportation expense. Our average realized price (including all cash settled derivatives and firm transportation) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized price (excluding cash settled derivatives and firm transportation) does not include derivative settlements or firm transportation, which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Average realized price (including firm transportation and excluding cash settled derivatives) does include firm transportation where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers. Average realized price calculations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are shown below:\n\nBrokered natural gas and marketing revenue was $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Brokered natural gas and marketing revenue includes revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not related to our production and from the release of firm transportation capacity. The increase from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to an increase in the amount of firm transportation that was available for brokered gas transactions or release to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per Mcfe, basis. The following table presents information about certain of our expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nLease operating expense was $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $20.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Lease operating expense per Mcfe was $0.23 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.18 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $7.8 million and $0.05 per Mcfe was attributable to increases in producing wells and salt water disposal expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018. Lease operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate our wells and non-recurring workovers and repairs.\nTransportation, gathering and compression expense was $138.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $124.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Transportation, gathering and compression expense per Mcfe was $1.10 in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following table details our transportation, gathering and compression expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe increase of $13.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to our production growth and increased firm transportation expenses, which increased primarily due to additional capacity that came online during the second half of 2018. These expenses were consistent on a per unit basis as increased firm transportation and production costs were offset by lower contractual gathering rates.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and applicable tax rates. Production and ad valorem taxes were $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Production and ad valorem taxes per Mcfe was $0.08 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.07 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The $1.6 million increase in aggregate production and ad valorem taxes was primarily due to increased production and well count. The increase of $0.01 on a per unit basis was driven by increased severance taxes associated with our increased liquids production.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was approximately $134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $119.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This $15.6 million increase was primarily due to an increase in production and proved property costs. On a per Mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $1.07 in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1.05 in the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily due to a higher depletion rate resulting from our reserves increasing at a lower rate than our capital cost.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.35 in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.39 in the year ended December 31, 2017. The $0.2 million decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and benefits associated with decreased head count, and lower professional fees partially offset by approximately $4.0 million of expense related to the BRMR Merger. The decrease of $0.04 per Mcfe was primarily due to fixed costs spread across increased levels of production as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. General and administrative expense includes $7.9 million and $9.3 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration, rig termination and standby and (gain) loss on sale of assets. The following table details our other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nBrokered natural gas and marketing expense was $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense relate to gas purchases for brokered natural gas that we buy and sell that is not related to our production and firm transportation capacity that is marketed to third parties. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of firm transportation that was available for brokered gas transactions or release to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nExploration expense decreased to $49.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nDelay rentals were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in delay rentals related to converting future lump-sum extension payments into annual delay rentals.\nImpairment of unproved properties was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a decrease in expected lease expirations due to the increase in our planned future drilling activity. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current commodity price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.\nRig termination and standby expense was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was no rig termination and standby expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of assets was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, each due to the sale of certain non-core assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments was ($21.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to changes in commodity prices during each year. Cash payments were approximately $27.0 million and $2.2 million for the derivative instruments that settled during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest expense, net was $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $49.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was not recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to the Company recording a higher valuation allowance related to its pre-tax losses and reducing the valuation allowance to the extent of pre-tax income.\nCash Flows, Capital Resources and Liquidity\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by our operating cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity securities. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $255.4 million compared to $225.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash provided from operating activities reflects working capital changes, operating income, timing of cash receipts and disbursements and the increase in our production during the year-over-year comparative periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $335.5 million compared to $266.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we:\n \u2022 spent $349.7 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 received $2.0 million from assets sales; and \n \u2022 received $12.9 million as part of the assets acquired in the BRMR Merger. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 spent $275.6 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 spent $1.0 million on property and equipment; and \n \u2022 received $10.4 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets. \nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $86.2 million compared to $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we:\n \u2022 borrowed $97.5 million under our revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 withheld from employees' shares totaling $6.7 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards; and \n \u2022 paid $4.3 million of deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and amendment to the Credit Agreement. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 borrowed $32.5 million under our revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 withheld from employees shares totaling $1.3 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $225.1 million compared to $112.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash provided from operating activities reflects working capital changes, operating income and the timing of cash receipts and disbursements during the year-over-year comparative periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $266.3 million compared to $292.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 spent $275.6 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 spent $1.0 million on property and equipment; and \n \u2022 received $10.4 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we:\n \u2022 spent $291.8 million on capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties; \n \u2022 spent $2.0 million on property and equipment; and \n \u2022 received $1.3 million of proceeds relating to the sale of assets. \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.9 million compared to ($4.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we:\n \u2022 borrowed $32.5 million under our revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 withheld from employees shares totaling $1.3 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we:\n \u2022 paid $1.8 million in financing costs associated with an amendment to the Credit Agreement that, among other things, increased the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 withheld from employees' shares totaling $2.0 million related to the settlement of equity compensation awards. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, asset sales, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets. We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs, which requires substantial capital expenditures. We periodically review capital expenditures and adjust our budget based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities, and commodity prices. We believe that our existing cash on hand, operating cash flow and available proceeds under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2020.\nFuture success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We will continue using net cash on hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds available under our revolving credit facility to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs, and as necessary, we will seek additional sources of debt or equity to fund these requirements. Longer-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices we receive for our production as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the natural gas and oil business. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales, joint venture transactions or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023. Further, based on our current forecast and activity levels, we expect to remain in compliance with all such debt covenants for the next twelve months. However, if oil and natural gas prices decrease to lower levels, we are likely to generate lower operating cash flows, which would make it more difficult for us to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants, including requirements with respect to working capital and interest coverage ratios. This could negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources.\nCredit Arrangements\nLong-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018, excluding discount, totaled $640.5 million and $543.0 million, respectively. Long-term debt includes both the senior unsecured notes outstanding and any outstanding borrowings against our revolving credit facility.\nInformation related to our credit arrangements is described in Note 9- Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the spot regional market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Pricing for natural gas, NGLs and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price.\nTo mitigate the potential negative impact on our cash flow caused by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, we may enter into financial commodity derivative contracts to ensure that we receive minimum prices for a portion of our future natural gas production when management believes that favorable future prices can be secured. We typically hedge the NYMEX Henry Hub price for natural gas, the WTI price for oil and a NGLs basket based on prices at Mont Belvieu, Texas.\nOur hedging activities are intended to support natural gas, NGLs and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations. The counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the floor price specified in the contract and the settlement price, which is based on market prices on the settlement date, if the settlement price is below the floor price. We are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the ceiling price and the settlement price if the ceiling price is below the settlement price. These contracts may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty, zero cost collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production, and puts which require us to pay a premium either up front or at settlement and allow us to receive a fixed price at our option if the put price is above the market price. Information regarding the derivative contracts we had entered into as of December 31, 2019 is set forth in Note 7- Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBy using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, we expose ourselves to the credit risk of our counterparties. Credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty is expected to owe us, which creates credit risk. To minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments, it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. The creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review. As of December 31, 2019, we had derivative instruments in place with Bank of Montreal, BP Energy Company, Capital One N.A., Citibank, Citizens Bank N.A., EDF Energy, J Aron, KeyBank N.A., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, and Wells Fargo. We believe all of such institutions currently are an acceptable credit risk. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any past due receivables from counterparties.\nCapital Requirements\nOur primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties and repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors recently approved an initial capital budget for 2020 of between approximately $190 - $210 million, allocated approximately 95% for drilling and completions activities and approximately 5% for land capital requirements. The 2020 capital budget is expected to be substantially funded through internally generated cash flows, the Company's current cash balance and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and\ncompetitive developments. A reduction in natural gas, NGLs or oil prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production and our proved reserves as well as our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. Our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of assets.\nIn addition, we may from time to time seek to pay down, retire or repurchase our outstanding debt using cash or through exchanges of other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on available funds, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions in our Credit Agreement and other factors.\nCapitalization\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our total debt, excluding debt discount and issuance costs, and capitalization were as follows (in millions):\n\nCash Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, firm transportation, gas processing, gathering and compressions services, and asset retirement obligations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have significant capital leases, any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 reflects accrued interest payable of $21.3 million, compared to $21.7 million as of December 31, 2018. We paid the accrued interest balance in January 2020.\nWe have a contract for the service of one rig, which expires in October 2021, with the option to extend. We have also entered into firm transportation agreements with various pipelines in order to facilitate the delivery of production to market. These contracts commit us to transport minimum daily natural gas volumes at a negotiated rate or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate. We have also agreed to certain minimum commitments under long-term gas processing and gathering agreements as well as various gas compression agreements. For additional discussion, see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Midstream Agreements\u201d.\nOther\nWe lease acreage that is generally subject to lease expiration if operations are not commenced within a specified period, generally 5 years and approximately 56% of our leases in the Utica Core Area have a 3-5 year extension at our option. Based on our evaluation of prospective economics, including the cost of infrastructure to connect production, we have allowed acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. To date, our expenditures to comply with environmental or safety regulations have not been a significant component of our cost structure and are not expected to be significant in the future. However, new regulations, enforcement policies, claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs.\nInterest Rates\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $510.5 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, excluding discounts, which bore interest at a fixed cash interest rate of 8.875%, due semi-annually from the date of issuance.\nInformation related to our interest rates is described in Note 9- Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments which are described above under -Cash Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nInflation and Changes in Prices\nOur revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, it does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs in fiscal 2020 to continue to be a function of supply and demand. Further strengthening of commodity prices could stimulate demand for ancillary services causing services costs to increase. In the near term, the majority of our service costs are expected to remain flat in 2020 due to previously negotiated drilling, stimulation, and rentals contracts. Along with these contacts, we have secured quality service equipment and tenured personnel to limit our exposure to increasing service costs and improve operational efficiencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year and proved natural gas and oil reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\nCertain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nNatural Gas and Oil Properties\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and oil producing activities. Unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed natural gas and oil reserves as estimated by our engineers and audited by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well; and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Proven property leasehold costs are amortized to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes.\nProved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are economically recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes\nexpected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, including the rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements which were adopted effective December 31, 2009, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in our depletion rates. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Executive Vice President, Resource Planning and Development who reports directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum engineers to prepare our estimates of proved reserves at least annually. SIS, our independent petroleum engineers for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, prepared 100% of our reserves in 2019 and 2018 and NSAI, our independent petroleum engineers, for all prior years, prepared 100% of our reserves in 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. For additional discussion, See Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Oil and Natural Gas Data-Proved Reserves\u201d.\nDepletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. While total depletion expense for the life of a property is limited to the property's total cost, proved reserve revisions result in a change in the timing of when depletion expense is recognized. Downward revisions of proved reserves may result in an acceleration of depletion expense, while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of depletion expense recognition. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from property asset groups, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to natural gas and oil producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 19- Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis.\nWe monitor our long-lived assets recorded in natural gas and oil properties in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves that will be produced from the property asset groups future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property asset group for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for natural gas, NGLs and/or oil, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts or environmental regulations. Our natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for potential impairments at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of other groups of assets. All of these factors must be considered when testing a property asset group carrying value for impairment.\nThe review is done by determining if the historical cost of proved and unproved properties less the applicable accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion is less than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The expected undiscounted future net cash flows are estimated based on our plans to produce and develop reserves. Expected undiscounted future net cash inflows from the sale of produced reserves are calculated based on estimated future prices and estimated operating and development costs. We estimate prices based upon market related information including published futures prices. The estimated future level of production, which is based on proved and risk adjusted probable reserves, has assumptions surrounding the future levels of prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates. In certain circumstances, we also consider potential sales of properties to third parties in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows. When the carrying value exceeds the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate similar to that used by market participants) and the carrying value of the asset. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future.\nWe believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impractical to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome. If natural gas, NGLs and oil prices decrease or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record additional impairments.\nWe evaluate our unproved property investment periodically for impairment. The majority of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leaseholds. The costs are capitalized and evaluated (at least quarterly) as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. Impairment of a significant portion of our unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. Potential impairment of individually significant unproved property is assessed on a property-by-property basis considering a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically pursue the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of natural gas and oil production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nInherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d), a corresponding adjustment is made to the natural gas and oil property balance. For example, as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment in formation, we may revise our estimate of current costs, the assumed annual inflation of the costs and/or the assumed productive lives of our wells. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates.\nRevenue
