Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, production timing and volumes, estimates of proved reserves, operating costs and capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. As a result of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.\nOverview\nWe have been engaged in the onshore oil and natural gas acquisition, exploitation, exploration and production business in the United States since 1987. Currently, we are focusing on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the STACK. We have transitioned our focus from our diversified asset base composed of a portfolio of conventional assets to an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK with an extensive inventory of drilling opportunities. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we have assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations primarily target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego formations. We continue to opportunistically acquire acreage in our non-operated locations with the goal of operating wells in these locations. At present, we have seven operated horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase to eight rigs by the end of 2018.\nThe amount of revenue we generate from our operations will fluctuate based on, among other things:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe prices at which we will sell our production;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe level of our operating and administrative costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommodity prices remain unpredictable. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. In order to mitigate the impact of changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices on our cash flows, we are a party to hedging and other price protection contracts, and we intend to enter into such transactions in the future to reduce the effect of price volatility on our cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, amounts presented reflect our proportionate interest in such activities. Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in the future.\nOutlook\nOur revenue, profitability and future growth depend on many factors, particularly the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which are beyond our control. The success of our business is significantly affected by the price of oil due to our current focus on development of oil reserves and exploration for oil. Our industry has been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices in recent years.\nCommodity prices remained volatile, but generally increased on average in 2017 relative to 2016 in response to improving supply and demand of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and other factors. Oil prices in particular showed significant signs of improvement in early 2018, with NYMEX West Texas Intermediate ( NYMEX WTI\u201d) reaching $66.14 per barrel on January 26, 2018. The NYMEX WTI monthly settlement price averaged approximately $50.95 per Bbl in 2017 as compared to an average price of $43.32 per Bbl in 2016. NYMEX Henry Hub monthly settlement price for natural gas averaged approximately $3.11 per MMBtu in 2017 as compared to a monthly settlement average price of $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016. On March 20, 2018, NYMEX WTI was $63.40 per barrel and NYMEX Henry Hub was $2.68 per MMBtu. Factors affecting oil prices include worldwide economic conditions, including the European credit markets; geopolitical activities, including developments in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere; worldwide supply conditions; weather conditions; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the value of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Commodity prices remain unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the increase in market prices experienced in recent months will be sustained. If oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices decrease, such decrease could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the carrying value of our oil and\nnatural gas properties, our proved reserves and our ability to finance operations, including the amount of our borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nWe have increased our anticipated capital expenditures for 2018 to $568 million. Additionally, we anticipate that up to an additional $25 million will be funded for 2018 drilling and completions activity in the STACK by BCE pursuant to our joint development agreement. Following the business combination, we have allocated all of our 2018 capital expenditures to develop the STACK. We anticipate operating up to eight drilling rigs by the end of 2018, which will result in drilling a total of approximately 173 gross wells in the STACK.\nOur derivative contracts are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are highly sensitive to changes in the price of oil and natural gas. Changes in these derivative assets and liabilities are reported in our consolidated statement of operations as gain / loss on derivative contracts which include both the non-cash increase / decrease in the fair value of derivative contracts, as well as the effect of cash settlements of derivative contracts during the period. In 2017, we recognized a net gain on our derivative contracts of $8.3 million, which includes $4.1 million in cash settlements received for derivative contracts. The objective of our hedging program is that, over time, the combination of settlement gains and losses from derivative contracts with ordinary oil and natural gas revenues will produce relative revenue stability. However, in the short term, both settlements and fair value changes in our derivative contracts can significantly impact our results of operations, and we expect these gains and losses to continue to reflect changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nCurrently, we have hedged approximately 45% of our forecasted production of proved developed producing reserves through 2020 at weighted average annual floor prices ranging from $50.00 per Bbl to $52.22 per Bbl for oil and $2.80 per MMBtu to $2.90 per MMBtu for natural gas. If oil and/or natural gas prices continue to decline for an extended period of time, we may be unable to replace expiring hedge contracts or enter new contracts for additional oil and natural gas production at favorable prices.\nDepressed oil and natural gas prices have impacted our earnings by necessitating impairment write-downs in some of our properties, either directly by decreasing the market values of the properties, or indirectly, by lowering rates of return on oil and natural gas development projects and increasing the chance of impairment write-downs. We recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $30.3 million, $16.3 million and $50.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 write-downs were primarily due unproved leasehold costs that were either expired or will be expiring where the Company had no plans for future development, downward revisions in proved reserves and higher operating costs related to our non-STACK assets. Our impairments were primarily related to our oil and natural gas properties related to our non-STACK assets.\n\ufeff\nIn the future, we may recognize significant impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties and impairments of unproved oil and natural gas properties as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and changes to our drilling plans. At December 31, 2017, our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas properties with a net book value of approximately $762.2 million indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this depletion group may be at risk for impairment if oil and natural gas prices decline by 10%. We estimate that, if the oil and natural gas decline by 10%, this depletion group could become impaired in a future period and we could recognize non-cash impairments in that period in excess of $2.7 million. It is also reasonably foreseeable that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to our drilling plans in response to lower prices or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments. For further information, see Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017 v. Year Ended December 31, 2016: Impairment Expense.\u201d\nThe primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, the effectiveness and efficiency of our production operations, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, we face the challenge of natural production declines. We attempt to overcome this natural decline primarily through development of our existing undeveloped reserves, enhanced completions and well recompletions, and other enhanced recovery methods. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production. Our ability to add reserves through drilling and other development techniques is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completing or connecting our new wells to gathering lines will negatively affect our production, which will have an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash flow from operations.\nRecent Activity\nBusiness Combination with Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.\nOn August 16, 2017, we entered into a Contribution Agreement (the AM Contribution Agreement\u201d) with Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (formerly Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II, a Delaware corporation ( AMR\u201d)), High Mesa Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the AM Contributor\u201d), High Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and the sole general partner of the AM Contributor, Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and our sole general partner ( AMH GP\u201d), and, solely for certain provisions therein, the equity owners of the AM Contributor. Simultaneous with the execution of the AM Contribution Agreement, AMR entered into (i) a Contribution Agreement (the KFM Contribution Agreement\u201d) with KFM Holdco,\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the KFM Contributor\u201d), Kingfisher Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Kingfisher\u201d), and, solely for certain provisions therein, the equity owners of the KFM Contributor; and (ii) a Contribution Agreement (the Riverstone Contribution Agreement\u201d and, together with the AM Contribution Agreement and the KFM Contribution Agreement, the Contribution Agreements\u201d) with Riverstone VI Alta Mesa Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Riverstone Contributor\u201d).\nOn February 9, 2018 (the Closing Date\u201d), we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreements and SRII Opco LP, a Delaware limited partnership ( SRII Opco LP\u201d) acquired (a) (i) all of the limited partner interests in us and (ii) 100% of the economic interests and 90% of the voting interests in AMH GP (with (i) and (ii) collectively, the AM Contribution\u201d) and (b) 100% of the economic interests in Kingfisher (the Kingfisher Contribution\u201d). The acquisition of us and Kingfisher pursuant to the Contribution Agreements is referred to herein as the business combination\u201d and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreements are referred to herein as the Transactions.\u201d\nSRII Opco GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( SRII Opco GP\u201d), the sole general partner of SRII Opco LP, is a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR. The limited partners of SRII Opco LP are the AM Contributor, the KFM Contributor and the Riverstone Contributor (collectively, the Contributors\u201d), AMR and certain funds managed by Highbridge. As a result of the Transactions, AMR has obtained control over the management of AMH GP and, consequently, us. AMR is a publicly traded corporation that is not under the control of any person. Prior to the closing of the Transactions, AMH GP, and consequently, us, was controlled by High Mesa and indirectly by our founder and Chief Operating Officer Michael E. Ellis.\nHarlan H. Chappelle, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Michael Ellis, our Chief Operating Officer and a director and certain affiliates of Bayou City Energy Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Bayou City\u201d), and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Highbridge\u201d), continue to own an aggregate 10% voting interest in AMH GP following the closing. These existing owners were a party to a voting agreement with the AM Contributor and AMH GP, pursuant to which they agreed to vote their interests in AMH GP as directed by the AM Contributor. In connection with the closing of the Transactions, the parties amended and restated the voting agreement to include SRII Opco LP as a party and the existing owners agreed to vote their interests in AMH GP as directed by SRII Opco LP and appoint SRII Opco LP as their respective proxy and attorney-in-fact with respect to any voting matters related to their respective interests in AMH GP. The amended and restated voting agreement will continue in force until SRII Opco LP elects to terminate the agreement or, with respect to each existing owner individually, such existing owner no longer owns a voting interest in AMH GP. The closing of the business combination did not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing our 7.875% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d).\nConsideration\nPursuant to the AM Contribution Agreement, at the closing of the Transactions (the Closing\u201d), the AM Contributor received 138,402,398 common units representing limited partner interests (the Common Units\u201d) in SRII Opco LP. The AM Contributor also acquired from AMR a number of newly issued shares of non-economic capital stock of AMR, designated as Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class C Common Stock\u201d), corresponding to the number of Common Units received by the AM Contributor at the Closing.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the above, for a period of seven years following the Closing, the AM Contributor will be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $800 million in earn-out consideration to be paid in the form of Common Units (and acquire a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock) as specified below if the 20-day volume-weighted average price ( 20-Day VWAP\u201d) of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds the following prices (each such payment, an Earn-Out Payment\u201d):\n\ufeff\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n20-Day\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nVWAP\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nEarn-Out Consideration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n10,714,285 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n9,375,000 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13,888,889 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12,500,000 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe AM Contributor will not be entitled to receive a particular Earn-Out Payment on more than one occasion and, if, on a particular date, the 20-Day VWAP entitles the AM Contributor to more than one Earn-Out Payment (each of which has not been previously paid), the AM Contributor will be entitled to receive each such Earn-Out Payment. The AM Contributor will be entitled to the earn-out consideration described above in connection with certain liquidity events of AMR, including a merger or sale of all or substantially all of AMR's assets, if the consideration paid to holders of Class A Common Stock in connection with such liquidity event is greater than any of the above-specified 20-Day VWAP hurdles.\nAMR also contributed approximately $554 million in cash to us at the Closing. AMR's source for these funds was from the sale of its securities to investors in a public offering and in private placements.\nExchange or Redemption of Common Units\nBeginning 180 days after the Closing, the AM Contributor will have the right to exchange its Common Units for shares of AMR Class A Common Stock or cash (at AMR's election). Upon any redemption of Common Units by the AM Contributor, a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock owned by the AM Contributor will be cancelled.\nAmended Limited Partnership and Limited Liability Company Agreements\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination on February 9, 2018, AMH GP and SRII Opco LP entered into a Seventh Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Alta Mesa (the Seventh Amended Partnership Agreement\u201d). The Seventh Amended Partnership Agreement reflects, among other things, that SRII Opco LP is now the sole limited partner of Alta Mesa.\nIn addition, on February 9, 2018, the owners of AMH GP entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of AMH GP (the Sixth Amended LLC Agreement\u201d), which was amended to, reflect that SRII Opco LP, now the holder of all of the Class A Units (as defined therein) is entitled to 100% of the economic rights with respect to AMH GP, and that SRII Opco LP is now the holder of 90% of the Class B Units (as defined therein) which are entitled to 100% of the voting rights with respect to AMH GP.\nAs described above, on February 9, 2018, all of the owners of AMH GP entered into an amended and restated voting agreement (the Voting Agreement\u201d) regarding the voting of their interests in AMH GP.\nAppointment and Departure of Directors\nIn connection with the business combination, Michael A. McCabe, Homer Gene\u201d Cole, Mickey Ellis, Don Dimitrievich, William W. McMullen and Mark Stoner resigned from the board of AMH GP. Harlan H. Chappelle and Michael E. Ellis remain directors on the board of AMH GP. In connection with the business combination, James T. Hackett was appointed to the board of AMH GP. Our executive management team remains the same, except that Mr. Hackett is now Chairman of the Board.\nDistribution of Non-Stack Assets\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination, we have completed our transition from a diversified asset base composed of a portfolio of conventional assets to an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK. On February 8, 2018, we distributed the remainder of our non-STACK assets to AM Contributor as a dividend. At the time of the disposition, our management estimated the carrying value of our remaining non-STACK assets to be $42.8 million with liabilities of $52.5 million, which liabilities include $44.6 million of asset retirement obligations.\nAmended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination, we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility is for an aggregate maximum credit amount of $1.0 billion with an initial $350.0 million borrowing base limit. The Eighth A&R credit facility does not permit us to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing we are not in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants. As of February 9, 2018, all outstanding balances under our credit facility were paid in full.\nFor further details of the business combinations please Note 19 - Subsequent Events in the consolidated financial statements.\nWeeks Island Sale\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold our oil and natural gas assets in the Weeks Island field. Results of operations for the Weeks Island field are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See Note 6 - Discontinued Operations to consolidated financial statements for details. Operating revenues and expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in the Weeks Island.\nResults of Operations\nSelected Operating Data.

The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to higher prices as well as increased production volumes. The average price of oil exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 22% in 2017 resulting in an increase in oil revenues of approximately $37.1 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 29% from $68.96 per Bbl in 2016 to $49.13 per Bbl in 2017. An increase in production of 1,263 MBbls, or 43% resulted in an approximate $51.2 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil volumes is primarily due to new production from the STACK, which increased 1,337 MBbls, from 2,570 MBbls in 2016 to 3,907 MBbls in 2017, partially offset by decreased production from non-STACK fields due to natural decline.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 61%, to $47.6 million in 2017 from $29.5 million in 2016. The increase in natural gas revenue was attributable to increased production volumes as well as higher prices during 2017. An increase in production of 4.7 Bcf, or 35% resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $10.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in natural gas volumes is attributable to new production from the STACK, which increased 5.7 Bcfe, from 8.2 Bcfe in 2016 to 13.9 Bcfe in 2017. This increase was partially offset by decreased production from non-STACK fields due to natural decline. The average price of natural gas exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 20% in 2017 resulting in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $7.7 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 12% from $2.69 per Mcf in 2016 to $3.01 per Mcf in 2017.\nNatural gas liquids revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 116% to $33.8 million in 2017 from $15.7 million in 2016. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in prices as well as increased volumes. The average price of natural gas liquids exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 49%, from $16.38 per Bbl in 2016 to $24.36 per Bbl in 2017 resulting in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $11.0 million. An increase in volumes of 431 MBbls or 45% resulted in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $7.1 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in natural gas liquid volumes is due primarily to an increase in output in the STACK, which increased 454 MBbls, from 823 MBbls in 2016 to 1,277 MBbls in 2017. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes from other non-STACK fields.\nOther revenues were $6.0 million during 2017 as compared to $2.6 million during 2016. Other revenues include salt water disposal fees charged to outside working interest owners. The salt water disposal fees were reclassified from lease operating expense. The fees increased from $2.1 million in 2016 to $5.7 million in 2017.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets was a gain of $3.5 million in 2016 as a result of the sale of South Louisiana properties in 2016.\nGain on acquisition of oil and gas properties was a gain of $3.3 million in 2017, primarily related to the acquisitions of proved STACK oil and natural gas properties from Brown and Borelli, et al ( B&B\u201d) and Sentanta Energy, LLC. The bargain purchase gains recognized related to acquisitions which were accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations during the year ended December 31, 2017 (Refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts was a gain of $8.3 million in 2017 inclusive of net derivative settlements received of $4.1 million in 2017 that included a gain of $5.8 million on contracts prior to expiry. This compared to a loss of $40.5 million in 2016 inclusive of net derivative settlements received of $88.7 million in 2016 that included a gain of $64.0 million on contracts prior to expiry. The significant fluctuation from period to period is due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedge contracts during these periods.\nExpenses\nLease and plant operating expense increased $14.5 million to $60.9 million, or 31% in 2017 as compared to $46.4 million in 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased production volume and increased compression, salt water disposal, chemicals, repairs and maintenance and fuel and power totaling $12.4 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expense decreased 7% from $7.62 to $7.10 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nMarketing and transportation expense increased $17.7 million to $30.5 million in 2017 as compared to $12.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily in the STACK due to increased throughput at the Kingfisher processing facility beginning in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the increase is due to higher marketing and transportation fee charged to provide effective gathering, efficient processing and assurance that our production will continue to flow as the activity in the basin expands at the Kingfisher processing facility. On a per unit basis, marketing and transportation expense increased from $2.11 to $3.56 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes increased $3.0 million to $7.2 million, or 73%, for 2017, as compared to $4.2 million for 2016. Production taxes increased $3.0 million primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas revenues. Ad valorem taxes\nremained flat year over year. On a per unit basis, the production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.68 to $0.84 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nWorkover expense increased $2.3 million to $5.8 million from $3.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is attributable to many different properties.\nExploration expense includes the costs of our geology department, costs of geological and geophysical data, delay rentals, expired leases, and dry holes. Exploration expense decreased $0.2 million to $24.6 million in 2017 from $24.8 million in 2016. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily due to decreases in lease rental expenses and G&G seismic expenses of $5.3 million, partially offset by an increase in dry hole expense and settlements of our asset retirement obligations in excess of our estimate of $5.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, our property, plant, and equipment balance includes $2.0 million in exploratory well costs which are deferred, pending determination of proved reserves. Such costs will be charged to exploration expense if the wells are ultimately classified as dry holes.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $29.5 million to $94.5 million for 2017 as compared to $65.0 million for 2016. On a per unit basis, this expense increased 3% from $10.67 to $11.02 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively. The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and production by field.\nImpairment expense increased $14.0 million to $30.3 million in 2017 from $16.3 million in 2016. This non-cash expense varies with the results of exploratory and development drilling, as well as with well performance and price declines which may render some projects uneconomic, resulting in impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Impairment\u201d below for more details related to impairment. Certain developed fields were impaired due to downward revisions in reserves based on lower commodity prices, performance, development drilling results that were below expectations or high operating costs. Certain undeveloped leasehold costs were impaired as the Company changed its strategic plans on future development in certain areas. The impairments in 2017 were primarily due to write-downs of both unproved oil and natural gas costs and developed fields, primarily in the non-STACK assets. The impairments in 2016 were primarily due to write-downs in developed fields on non-STACK assets, most notably in the Northwest, East Texas and South Louisiana, totaling $15.4 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $13.8 million to $55.6 million in 2017 from $41.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily due to consulting fees attributable to the business combination of approximately $7.7 million, an increase in information technology consulting fees of $1.2 million and settlement expense of $4.2 million. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% from $6.86 to $6.48 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest expense, net decreased $9.4 million to $50.6 million in 2017 from $60.0 million in 2016. The interest on our senior term loan facility decreased $9.2 million as it was repaid in full during the fourth quarter 2016 and interest on our senior secured credit facility decreased $1.0 million due to a decrease in average outstanding balances during the year. In addition, deferred financing costs associated with the senior term loan facility decreased $1.1 million. The decrease was partially offset by the repurchase and redemption of our $450 million aggregate principal amount of 9.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018 by issuing $500 million aggregate principal amount 7.875% senior unsecured notes due 2024, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $2.1 million.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $18.2 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of our $450 million outstanding 2018 Notes for an aggregate cost of $459.4 million, including accrued interest and fees. We recognized a loss related to the repurchase of $13.5 million, which included unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $4.1 million. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility of $127.7 million, which includes accrued interest and a prepayment premium of $2.5 million. We recognized a loss related to the repayment of $4.7 million, which included unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $2.0 million.\nLoss on discontinued operations was $21.4 million in 2017 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $2.3 million in 2016. The increase in the loss on discontinued operations was primarily related to the loss from the sale of assets recognized of $22.2 million.\nResults of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2016 v.

The decrease in oil revenue was primarily attributable to lower prices, partially offset by increased production volumes. The average price of oil exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 12% in 2016 resulting in a decrease in oil revenues of approximately $16.5 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 10% from $76.39 per Bbl in 2015 to $68.96 per Bbl in 2016. An increase in production of 91 MBbls, or 3% resulted in an approximate $4.2 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil volumes is primarily by new production from the STACK, which increased 564 MBbls, from 2,006 MBbls in 2015 to 2,570 MBbls in 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreased volume to the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 430 MBbls and natural production decline related to our non-STACK assets.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.1 million, or 12%, to $29.5 million in 2016 from $26.4 million in 2015. The increase in natural gas revenue was attributable to increased production volumes partially offset by lower prices during 2016. An increase in production of 2.9 Bcf, or 28% resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $7.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in natural gas volumes is attributable to new production from the STACK, which increased 3.9 Bcfe, from 4.3 Bcfe in 2015 to 8.2 Bcfe in 2016. This increase was partially offset by natural production decline related to our non-STACK assets and the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 415 MMcf. The average price of natural gas exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 13% in 2016 resulting in a decrease in natural gas revenues of approximately $4.3 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 42% from $4.63 per Mcf in 2015 to $2.69 per Mcf in 2016.\nNatural gas liquids revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4.8 million, or 44% to $15.7 million in 2016 from $10.9 million in 2015. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue was primarily attributable to increased volumes as well as an increase in prices. An increase in volumes of 278 MBbls or 41% resulted in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $4.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in natural gas liquid volumes is due primarily to an increase in output in the STACK, which increased 324 MBbls, from 499 MBbls in 2015 to 823 MBbls in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes due to the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 84 MBbls. The average price of natural gas liquids exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 2%, from $16.01 per Bbl in 2015 to $16.38 per Bbl in 2016 resulting in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $0.4 million.\nOther revenues were $2.6 million during 2016 as compared to $0.7 million during 2015. Other revenues include salt water disposal fees charged to outside working interest owners. The salt water disposal fees were reclassified from lease operating expense. The fees increased from $0.0 million in 2015 to $2.1 million in 2016.\nGain on sale of assets was a gain of $3.5 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of $67.8 million in 2015. The sale of South Louisiana properties in 2016 resulted in a gain of $3.5 million. The sale of our remaining Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 resulted in a gain of $67.6 million.\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts was a loss of $40.5 million inclusive of derivative settlements received of $88.7 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of $124.1 million inclusive of derivative settlements received of $106.9 million in 2015. The significant fluctuation from period to period is due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedge contracts during these periods.\nExpenses\nLease and plant operating expense decreased $7.4 million to $46.4 million, or 14% in 2016 as compared to $53.8 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salt water disposal, repairs and maintenance, and field services, totaling $6.6 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expense decreased 26% from $10.28 to $7.62 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nMarketing and transportation expense increased $9.7 million to $12.8 million in 2016 as compared to $3.1 million in 2015. The increase is primarily in the STACK due to increased throughput at the Kingfisher processing facility beginning in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the increase is due to higher marketing and transportation fee charged to provide effective gathering, efficient processing and assurance that our production will continue to flow as the activity in the basin expands at the Kingfisher processing facility. On a per unit basis, marketing and transportation expense increased from $0.60 to $2.11 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes decreased $2.1 million to $4.2 million, or 34%, for 2016, as compared to $6.3 million for 2015. Production taxes decreased $1.6 million primarily due to the decrease in oil revenues. Ad valorem taxes decreased $0.5 million. On a per unit basis, the production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $1.20 to $0.68 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nWorkover expense decreased $1.7 million to $3.5 million from $5.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is attributable to many different properties.\nExploration expense includes the costs of our geology department, costs of geological and geophysical data, delay rentals, expired leases, and dry holes. Exploration expense decreased $4.7 million to $24.8 million in 2016 from $29.5 million in 2015. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily due to decreases in dry hole expense and G&G seismic expenses of $11.7 million, partially offset by an increase in expired leasehold and settlements of our asset retirement obligations in excess of our estimates of $7.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, our property, plant, and equipment balance includes $2.1 million in exploratory well costs which are deferred, pending determination of proved reserves. Such costs will be charged to exploration expense if the wells are ultimately classified as dry holes.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $13.0 million to $65.0 million for 2016 as compared to $78.0 million for 2015. On a per unit basis, this expense decreased 28% from $14.89 to $10.67 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and production by field.\nImpairment expense decreased $34.1 million to $16.3 million in 2016 from $50.4 million in 2015. This non-cash expense varies with the results of exploratory and development drilling, as well as with well performance and price declines which may render some projects uneconomic, resulting in impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Impairment\u201d below for more details related to impairment. Certain developed fields were impaired due to downward revisions in reserves based on lower commodity prices, performance or development drilling results that were below expectations. The impairments in 2016 were primarily due to write-downs in developed fields related to our non-STACK assets, totaling $15.4 million. The impairments in 2015 were primarily due to write-downs of both unproved oil and natural gas costs and developed fields, primarily in East Texas, the STACK, and South Louisiana, totaling $34.2 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $2.7 million to $41.8 million in 2016 from $44.5 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower litigation settlement expenses recorded in 2016 as compared to 2015 of $5.3 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries, benefits and deferred compensation of $2.6 million in 2016. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 19% from $8.49 to $6.86 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.8 million to $60.0 million in 2016 from $61.8 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the tender and redemption of the 2018 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2016, which decreased interest costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and senior term loan facility. The senior term loan facility was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense incurred on our borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility increased $1.4 million due to an increase in average outstanding balance. Interest expense incurred on our borrowing under senior secured term loan facility increased $3.0 million as we recognized almost a full year of interest expense and additional amortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million as compared to prior year. We entered into the senior secured term loan facility during the second quarter of 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt was $18.2 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of our $450 million outstanding 2018 Notes for an aggregate cost of $459.4 million, including accrued interest and fees. We recognized a loss related to the repurchase of $13.5 million, which included unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $4.1 million. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility of $127.7 million, which includes accrued interest and a prepayment premium of $2.5 million. We recognized a loss related to the repayment of $4.7 million, which included unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $2.0 million.\nLoss on discontinued operations was $2.3 million in 2016 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $157.3 million in 2015. The decreased in the loss on discontinued operations was primarily due to a decrease in impairment expense recognized. Weeks Island field recognized impairment expense of approximately $20,000 during 2016 as compared to $126.3 million during 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal requirements for capital are to fund our day-to-day operations, our exploration and development activities, and to satisfy our contractual obligations, primarily for the payment of debt principal and interest and any amounts owed during the period related to our hedging positions.\nOur 2017 capital budget was primarily focused on the development of our STACK properties through exploitation and development. We spent approximately $369.6 million in 2017 on capital expenditures, including acquisitions, of which $356 million was spent in the STACK. The capital expenditures for 2017 reflected our plans to drill wells that were funded through the joint development agreement with BCE. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we have received approximately $92.7 million from BCE under our joint development agreement. We increased our capital budget for 2018 from 2017 levels in response to the improvement in the current commodity price environment. Our future drilling plans, plans of our drilling operators and capital budgets are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas\nprices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, actions of our operators, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. A deferral of planned capital expenditures, particularly with respect to drilling and completing new wells, could result in a reduction in anticipated production, revenues and cash flows. Additionally, if we curtail our drilling program, we may lose a portion of our acreage through lease expirations. However, because a large percentage of our acreage is held by production, we have the ability to materially increase or decrease our drilling and recompletion budget in response to market conditions with decreased risk of losing significant acreage. In addition, we may be required to reclassify some portion of our reserves currently booked as proved undeveloped reserves to no longer be proved reserves if such a deferral of planned capital expenditures means we will be unable to develop such reserves within five years of their initial booking.\nWe funded our 2017 capital expenditures predominantly with cash flows from operations, drilling and completion of capital funded through our joint development agreement with BCE, capital contribution of $200 million by Riverstone and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending. Subsequent to year end and in connection with the closing of the business combination, Alta Mesa Resources contributed an additional $554 million to us.\nWe expect to fund our capital budget in 2018 and beyond predominantly with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and drilling and completion capital funded through our joint development agreement with BCE. As we execute our business strategy, we will continually monitor the capital resources available to meet future financial obligations and planned capital expenditures. We believe our cash flows provided by operating activities, cash on hand and availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility will provide us with the financial flexibility and wherewithal to meet our cash requirements, including normal operating needs, and pursue our currently planned and future development drilling activities. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties and acquire additional properties. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nSenior Notes\nWe have $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes, or the senior notes\u201d, due December 15, 2024 which were issued at par by us and our wholly owned subsidiary Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp. (collectively, the Issuers\u201d) during the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2017. At any time prior to December 15, 2019, we may, from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes in an amount of cash not greater than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price of 107.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 120 days of the closing date of such equity offering. At any time prior to December 15, 2019, we may, on any one or more occasions, redeem all or part of the senior notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of change of control, each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. On and after December 15, 2019, we may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 105.906% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2019, 103.938% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2020, 101.969% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2021 and 100.000% beginning on December 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\nSubsequent to year end, the closing of the business combination with Alta Mesa Resources did not constitute as a change of control under the indenture governing the senior notes because certain existing owners of the Company and SRII Opco LP entered into the Voting Agreement with respect to the voting interests in AMH GP. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nThe senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our material subsidiaries, subject to certain customary release provisions. Accordingly, they will rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness; senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the senior notes or the respective guarantees; effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and obligations of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes.\nThe senior notes contain certain covenants limiting the Issuers' ability and the ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to, under certain circumstances, prepay subordinated indebtedness, pay distributions, redeem stock or make certain restricted investments; incur indebtedness; create liens on the Issuers' assets to secure debt; restrict dividends, distributions or other payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of restricted subsidiaries; effect a consolidation or merger; and change our line of business.\nThe indenture contains customary events of default, including:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\uf0b7\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\ndefault in any payment of interest on the senior notes when due, continued for 30 days;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\uf0b7\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\ndefault in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the senior notes when due;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\uf0b7\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nfailure by the Issuers or any subsidiary guarantor to comply with its obligations under the indenture;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\uf0b7\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\ndefault under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuers or restricted subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\uf0b7\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\ncertain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuers or restricted subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\uf0b7\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nfailure by the Issuers or certain subsidiaries that would constitute a payment of final judgment aggregating in excess of $20.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 9, 2018, we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility is for an aggregate of $1.0 billion with an initial $350.0 million borrowing base limit. The Eighth A&R credit facility does not permit us to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing we are not in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants.\n\ufeff\nAs of March 29, 2018, we have no outstanding borrowings under the Eighth A&R and have $13.6 million of outstanding letters of credit reimbursement obligations.\nThe principal amounts borrowed are payable on the maturity date on February 9, 2023. We have a choice of borrowing in Eurodollars or at the reference rate, with such borrowings bearing interest, payable quarterly for reference rate loans and one month, three month or six month periods for Eurodollar loans. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate at the LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%. Reference rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank's reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. The next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is on April 1, 2018. The borrowing base may be reduced in connection with the next redetermination of its borrowing base. The amounts outstanding under the Eighth A&R credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Company's and its material operating subsidiaries' oil and natural gas properties and associated assets and all of the stock of our material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Eighth A&R credit facility. Additionally, SRII Opco, LP and AMH GP have pledged their respective limited partner interests in us as security for our obligations. If an event of default occurs under the Eighth A&R credit facility, the administrative agent will have the right to proceed against the pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets and our material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors.\nThe Eighth A&R credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, guaranty or make loans to others, make investments, enter into mergers, make certain payments and distributions, enter into or be party to hedge agreements, amend our organizational documents, incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. The Eighth A&R credit facility permits us to make distributions to any parent entity (i) to pay for reimbursement of third party costs and expenses that are general and administrative expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business by such parent entity or (ii) in order to permit such parent entity to (x) make permitted tax distributions and (y) pay the obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below).\nThe Eighth A&R credit facility also requires us to maintain the following two financial ratios:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\nurirur\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na current ratio, tested quarterly, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, of our consolidated current assets to our consolidated current liabilities of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na leverage ratio, tested quarterly, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, of our consolidated debt (other than obligations under hedge agreements) as of the end of such fiscal quarter to its consolidated EBITDAX annualized by multiplying EBITDAX for the period of (A) the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018 times 4, (B) the two fiscal quarter periods ending September 30, 2018 times 2 and (C) the three fiscal quarter periods ending December 31, 2018 times 4/3rds and (D) for each fiscal quarter on or after March 31, 2019, EBITDAX times 4/4, of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nOperating activities (including operating activities from discontinued operations) provided cash of $59.3 million in 2017, as compared to $131.7 million in 2016. Of the $59.3 million and $131.7 million cash provided by operating activities in 2017 and 2016, discontinued operations provided cash of approximately $21.2 million and 27.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $72.4 million decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to various factors. Cash-based items of net income, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $8.4 million in earnings and a negative impact on cash flow. The changes in our working capital accounts used $64.0 million in cash as compared to having provided $23.8 million in cash in 2016.\nOperating activities (including operating activities from discontinued operations) provided cash of $131.7 million in 2016, as compared to $144.0 million in 2015. The $12.3 million decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to various factors. Cash-based items of net income, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $36.1 million in earnings and a negative impact on cash flow. The changes in our working capital accounts provided $23.8 million in cash as compared to having provided $4.5 million in cash in 2015.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities (including investing activities from discontinued operations) used cash of $345.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for property and equipment, including acquisitions used cash of $369.6 million and $225.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we entered into an interest bearing promissory note receivable with our affiliate Northwest Gas Processing, LLC for approximately $1.5 million in 2017. The cash used for investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Weeks Island field and other assets of approximately $25.2 million.\nInvesting activities (including investing activities from discontinued operations) used cash of $224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to proceeds from the sale of property in 2015 of approximately $141.4 million. The increase in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by decreased expenditures for drilling and development and decreased acquisitions in 2016.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $283.9 million during 2017 as compared to cash provided of $91.2 million during 2016, an increase of $192.7 million. During 2017, we drew down $76.4 million, net of payments, under our senior secured revolving credit facility and we paid $0.4 million of deferred financing costs related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and senior notes. During 2017, Riverstone was admitted as a limited partner in connection with its $200 million contribution to us. In addition, we received $7.9 million in capital contributions from our former Class B limited partner, High Mesa.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $91.2 million during 2016 as compared to cash used of $30.6 million during 2015, an increase of $121.8 million. During 2016, we used proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes of $500.0 million, capital contributions from our Class B limited partner of $303.5 million and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility of $222.6 million to repay $459.4 million on the 2018 Notes, repay $127.7 million on our senior secured term loan facility and pay down $333.9 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility. In addition, we incurred $13.7 million of deferred financing costs.\nRisk Management Activities - Commodity Derivative Instruments\nDue to the risk of low oil and natural gas prices, we periodically enter into price-risk management transactions (e.g., swaps, collars, puts, calls, and financial basis swap contracts) for a portion of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production. In certain cases, this allows us to achieve a more predictable cash flow, as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations. The commodity derivative instruments apply to only a portion of our production, and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices, and may partially limit our potential gains from future increases in prices. At December 31, 2017, commodity derivative instruments were in place covering approximately 69% of our projected oil production and, approximately 1% of our natural gas production from proved developed properties for 2018.

The weighted average rate on our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017 of 5.48% was utilized to calculate the projected interest for our senior secured revolving credit facility. Projected obligation amounts are based on the payment schedules for interest, and are not presented on an accrual basis. On February 9, 2018, and in connection with the closing of the business combination (as described in Note 19 - Subsequent Events), we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility extended our maturity date from November 2020 to February 2023. As of February 9, 2018, all outstanding balances under our credit facility were paid in full.

Our off-balance sheet obligations include the obligations under operating leases, and the $2.2 million contingent properties payment for properties acquired in 2008 and prior years. We also have bonds posted in the aggregate amount of $17.4 million, primarily to cover future abandonment costs, and $13.6 million in letters of credit provided under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We typically enter into short-term drilling contracts which are customary in the oil and gas industry. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe have no plans to enter into any additional off-balance sheet arrangements in the foreseeable future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). As used herein, the following acronyms have the following meanings: FASB\u201d means the Financial Accounting Standards Board; the Codification\u201d refers to the Accounting Standards Codification, the collected accounting and reporting guidance maintained by the FASB; ASC\u201d means Accounting Standards Codification and is generally followed by a number indicating a particular section of the Codification; and ASU\u201d means Accounting Standards Update, followed by an identification number, which are the periodic updates made to the Codification by the FASB.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.\nEmerging growth company. We are classified as an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among\nother things: (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues at the end of any fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates measured as of June 30, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\ufeff\nReserve estimates significantly impact depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and impairments of oil and natural gas properties and are subject to change based on changes in oil and natural gas prices and trends and changes in estimated reserve quantities. Other significant estimates include those related to oil and natural gas reserves, the value of oil and natural gas properties (including acquisition properties), oil and natural gas revenues, bad debts, asset retirement obligations, derivative contracts, state taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review estimates and underlying assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nProperty and Equipment. Oil and natural gas producing activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under the successful efforts method, lease acquisition costs and all development costs, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\nUnproved Properties - Acquisition costs associated with the acquisition of leases are recorded as unproved properties and capitalized as incurred. These consist of costs incurred in obtaining a mineral interest or right in a property, such as a lease in addition to options to lease, broker fees, recording fees and other similar costs related to activities in acquiring properties. Unproved properties are classified as unproved until proved reserves are discovered, at which time related costs are transferred to proved oil and natural gas properties.\nExploration Expense - Exploration expenses, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense as incurred. These expenses include seismic expenditures and other geological and geophysical costs, expired leases, and lease rentals. The costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic wells are initially capitalized pending determination of whether the well has discovered proved commercial reserves. If the exploratory well is determined to be unsuccessful, the cost of the well is transferred to expense. Exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Properties - Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering, and storing oil and natural gas are capitalized. All costs incurred to drill and equip successful exploratory wells, development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\nImpairment - The capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed at least quarterly for impairment following the guidance provided in ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Subsequent Measurement, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value and is not recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on comparing the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows at a producing field level to the carrying value of the assets. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on estimates of anticipated production from proved reserves and future crude oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, are lower than the carrying cost, the carrying cost of the asset or group of assets is reduced to fair value. For our proved oil and natural gas properties, we estimate fair value by discounting the projected future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.\nUnproved properties are assessed at least annually to determine whether they have been impaired. Individually significant properties are assessed for impairment on a property-by-property basis, while individually insignificant unproved leasehold costs may be assessed in the aggregate. If unproved leasehold costs are found to be impaired, an impairment allowance is provided and a loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization - Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) of capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method based upon estimated proved reserves. Assets are grouped for DD&A on the basis of reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. The reserve base used to calculate DD&A for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to\ncalculate DD&A for lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, includes only proved developed reserves.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues when products are delivered at a fixed or determinable price, title has transferred and collectability is reasonably assured. We use the sales method of accounting for recognition of natural gas imbalances.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. We use derivative contracts to hedge the effects of fluctuations in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We account for such derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d which establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and requires them to be measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 6 for information on fair value).\nUnder ASC 815, hedge accounting is used to defer recognition of unrealized changes in the fair value of such financial instruments, for those contracts which qualify as fair value or cash flow hedges, as defined in the guidance. Historically, we have not designated any of our derivative contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the contracts are included in earnings as Gain (loss) on derivative contracts.\u201d Cash flows from settlements of derivative contracts are classified as operating cash flows.\nIncome Taxes. We have elected under the Internal Revenue Code provisions to be treated as individual partnerships for tax purposes. Accordingly, items of income, expense, gains and losses flow through to the partners and are taxed at the partner level. Accordingly, no tax provision for federal operations taxes is included in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to the Texas margin tax, which is considered a state income tax, and is included in Provision for state income tax\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations. We record state income tax (current and deferred) based on taxable income as defined under the rules for the margin tax.\nAcquisitions. Acquisitions are accounted for as purchases using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the closing date of the acquisitions. Purchase prices are allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair value at the time of the acquisition.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We estimate the present value of future costs of dismantlement and abandonment of our wells, facilities, and other tangible, long-lived assets, recording them as liabilities in the period incurred. We follow ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. ASC 410 requires that an asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred or becomes determinable (as defined by the standard), with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash outflows for abandonment discounted generally at our cost of capital at the time of recognition.\nInvestments. Our investment consists of a 10.17% ownership interest in a drilling company, Orion Drilling Company, LLC ( Orion\u201d). The investment is accounted for under the cost method and we have recorded $9.0 million of Investment in LLC on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Under this method, our share of earnings or losses of the investment are not included in the consolidated statements of operations. Distributions from Orion are recognized in current period earnings as declared.\nPrior to the Closing, Alta Mesa was a part owner of AEM with an ownership interest of less than 10%. AEM markets our oil and natural gas and sells it under short-term contracts generally with month-to-month pricing based on published regional indices, with differentials for transportation, location, and quality taken into account. AEM remits monthly collections of these sales to us, and receives a 1% marketing fee.\nDeferred Financing Costs. The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing. These costs are amortized over the term of the related financing using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The amortization expense is recorded as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which seeks to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers concerning the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from those contracts. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued various clarifications and interpretive guidance to assist entities with implementation efforts, including guidance pertaining to the presentation of revenues on a gross basis (revenues presented separately from associated expenses) versus a net basis.\nASU 2014-09 and related interpretive guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, except for emerging growth companies that elect to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards pursuant to Section 7(a)(2)(b) of the Securities Act. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as necessary. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\ufeff\nWe are in the process of assessing our contracts and evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as it relates to certain sales contracts, and in particular, as it relates to disclosure requirements. In addition, we are evaluating the impact, if any, on the presentation of our future revenues and expenses under the new gross-versus-net presentation guidance. We continue to evaluate the impact of these and other provisions of ASU 2014-09 on our accounting policies, changes to relevant business practices, internal controls, and consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which supersedes ASC 840 Leases\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 842 Leases.\u201d The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents a lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 also requires disclosures designed to provide information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land easement practical expedient for transition to Topic 842 ( ASU 2018-01\u201d), which provides an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounting for as leases under Topic 840, Leases. The standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for all other entities, with earlier adoption permitted. In the normal course of business, we enter into operating lease agreements to support our exploration and development operations and lease assets such as drilling rigs, well equipment, compressors, office space and other assets.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial statements; however, the adoption and impletion of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in an increase in both the assets and liabilities relating to our operating lease activities greater than twelve months. The adoption is also expected to result in increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and interest expense and a reduction in rent expense recorded on our consolidated statement of operations, and additional disclosures. As part of our assessment to date, we have formed an implementation work team and will complete our evaluation in 2018. As we continue to evaluate and implement the standard, we plan to provide additional information about the expected financial impact at a future date. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during 2020. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard on January 1, 2019.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for all other entities. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during 2019. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance will not impact our financial position or results of operations but could result in presentation changes on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents on the statements of cash flows and to provide a reconciliation of the totals in that statement to the related captions in the balance sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2018 for private companies, and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2016-18 in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies for further details.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2017 for public companies and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for all other entities. The amendments should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date and disclosures are not required at transition. Early adoption is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-01 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however these amendments could result in the recording of fewer business combinations in the future periods.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, production timing and volumes, estimates of proved reserves, operating costs and capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. As a result of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.\nOverview\nWe have been engaged in the onshore oil and natural gas acquisition, exploitation, exploration and production business in the United States since 1987. Currently, we are focusing on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the STACK. We have transitioned our focus from our diversified asset base composed of a portfolio of conventional assets to an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK with an extensive inventory of drilling opportunities. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we have assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations primarily target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego formations. We continue to opportunistically acquire acreage in our non-operated locations with the goal of operating wells in these locations. At present, we have seven operated horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase to eight rigs by the end of 2018.\nThe amount of revenue we generate from our operations will fluctuate based on, among other things:\n \u00b7 the prices at which we will sell our production; \n \u00b7 the amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce; and \n \u00b7 the level of our operating and administrative costs. \nCommodity prices remain unpredictable. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. In order to mitigate the impact of changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices on our cash flows, we are a party to hedging and other price protection contracts, and we intend to enter into such transactions in the future to reduce the effect of price volatility on our cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, amounts presented reflect our proportionate interest in such activities. Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in the future.\nOutlook\nOur revenue, profitability and future growth depend on many factors, particularly the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which are beyond our control. The success of our business is significantly affected by the price of oil due to our current focus on development of oil reserves and exploration for oil. Our industry has been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices in recent years.\nCommodity prices remained volatile, but generally increased on average in 2017 relative to 2016 in response to improving supply and demand of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and other factors. Oil prices in particular showed significant signs of improvement in early 2018, with NYMEX West Texas Intermediate ( NYMEX WTI\u201d) reaching $66.14 per barrel on January 26, 2018. The NYMEX WTI monthly settlement price averaged approximately $50.95 per Bbl in 2017 as compared to an average price of $43.32 per Bbl in 2016. NYMEX Henry Hub monthly settlement price for natural gas averaged approximately $3.11 per MMBtu in 2017 as compared to a monthly settlement average price of $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016. On March 20, 2018, NYMEX WTI was $63.40 per barrel and NYMEX Henry Hub was $2.68 per MMBtu. Factors affecting oil prices include worldwide economic conditions, including the European credit markets; geopolitical activities, including developments in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere; worldwide supply conditions; weather conditions; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the value of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Commodity prices remain unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the increase in market prices experienced in recent months will be sustained. If oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices decrease, such decrease could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the carrying value of our oil and\nnatural gas properties, our proved reserves and our ability to finance operations, including the amount of our borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nWe have increased our anticipated capital expenditures for 2018 to $568 million. Additionally, we anticipate that up to an additional $25 million will be funded for 2018 drilling and completions activity in the STACK by BCE pursuant to our joint development agreement. Following the business combination, we have allocated all of our 2018 capital expenditures to develop the STACK. We anticipate operating up to eight drilling rigs by the end of 2018, which will result in drilling a total of approximately 173 gross wells in the STACK.\nOur derivative contracts are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are highly sensitive to changes in the price of oil and natural gas. Changes in these derivative assets and liabilities are reported in our consolidated statement of operations as gain / loss on derivative contracts which include both the non-cash increase / decrease in the fair value of derivative contracts, as well as the effect of cash settlements of derivative contracts during the period. In 2017, we recognized a net gain on our derivative contracts of $8.3 million, which includes $4.1 million in cash settlements received for derivative contracts. The objective of our hedging program is that, over time, the combination of settlement gains and losses from derivative contracts with ordinary oil and natural gas revenues will produce relative revenue stability. However, in the short term, both settlements and fair value changes in our derivative contracts can significantly impact our results of operations, and we expect these gains and losses to continue to reflect changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nCurrently, we have hedged approximately 45% of our forecasted production of proved developed producing reserves through 2020 at weighted average annual floor prices ranging from $50.00 per Bbl to $52.22 per Bbl for oil and $2.80 per MMBtu to $2.90 per MMBtu for natural gas. If oil and/or natural gas prices continue to decline for an extended period of time, we may be unable to replace expiring hedge contracts or enter new contracts for additional oil and natural gas production at favorable prices.\nDepressed oil and natural gas prices have impacted our earnings by necessitating impairment write-downs in some of our properties, either directly by decreasing the market values of the properties, or indirectly, by lowering rates of return on oil and natural gas development projects and increasing the chance of impairment write-downs. We recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $30.3 million, $16.3 million and $50.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 write-downs were primarily due unproved leasehold costs that were either expired or will be expiring where the Company had no plans for future development, downward revisions in proved reserves and higher operating costs related to our non-STACK assets. Our impairments were primarily related to our oil and natural gas properties related to our non-STACK assets.\n\ufeff\nIn the future, we may recognize significant impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties and impairments of unproved oil and natural gas properties as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and changes to our drilling plans. At December 31, 2017, our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas properties with a net book value of approximately $762.2 million indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this depletion group may be at risk for impairment if oil and natural gas prices decline by 10%. We estimate that, if the oil and natural gas decline by 10%, this depletion group could become impaired in a future period and we could recognize non-cash impairments in that period in excess of $2.7 million. It is also reasonably foreseeable that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to our drilling plans in response to lower prices or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments. For further information, see Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017 v. Year Ended December 31, 2016: Impairment Expense.\u201d\nThe primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, the effectiveness and efficiency of our production operations, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, we face the challenge of natural production declines. We attempt to overcome this natural decline primarily through development of our existing undeveloped reserves, enhanced completions and well recompletions, and other enhanced recovery methods. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production. Our ability to add reserves through drilling and other development techniques is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completing or connecting our new wells to gathering lines will negatively affect our production, which will have an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash flow from operations.\nRecent Activity\nBusiness Combination with Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.\nOn August 16, 2017, we entered into a Contribution Agreement (the AM Contribution Agreement\u201d) with Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (formerly Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II, a Delaware corporation ( AMR\u201d)), High Mesa Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the AM Contributor\u201d), High Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and the sole general partner of the AM Contributor, Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and our sole general partner ( AMH GP\u201d), and, solely for certain provisions therein, the equity owners of the AM Contributor. Simultaneous with the execution of the AM Contribution Agreement, AMR entered into (i) a Contribution Agreement (the KFM Contribution Agreement\u201d) with KFM Holdco,\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the KFM Contributor\u201d), Kingfisher Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Kingfisher\u201d), and, solely for certain provisions therein, the equity owners of the KFM Contributor; and (ii) a Contribution Agreement (the Riverstone Contribution Agreement\u201d and, together with the AM Contribution Agreement and the KFM Contribution Agreement, the Contribution Agreements\u201d) with Riverstone VI Alta Mesa Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Riverstone Contributor\u201d).\nOn February 9, 2018 (the Closing Date\u201d), we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreements and SRII Opco LP, a Delaware limited partnership ( SRII Opco LP\u201d) acquired (a) (i) all of the limited partner interests in us and (ii) 100% of the economic interests and 90% of the voting interests in AMH GP (with (i) and (ii) collectively, the AM Contribution\u201d) and (b) 100% of the economic interests in Kingfisher (the Kingfisher Contribution\u201d). The acquisition of us and Kingfisher pursuant to the Contribution Agreements is referred to herein as the business combination\u201d and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreements are referred to herein as the Transactions.\u201d\nSRII Opco GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( SRII Opco GP\u201d), the sole general partner of SRII Opco LP, is a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR. The limited partners of SRII Opco LP are the AM Contributor, the KFM Contributor and the Riverstone Contributor (collectively, the Contributors\u201d), AMR and certain funds managed by Highbridge. As a result of the Transactions, AMR has obtained control over the management of AMH GP and, consequently, us. AMR is a publicly traded corporation that is not under the control of any person. Prior to the closing of the Transactions, AMH GP, and consequently, us, was controlled by High Mesa and indirectly by our founder and Chief Operating Officer Michael E. Ellis.\nHarlan H. Chappelle, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Michael Ellis, our Chief Operating Officer and a director and certain affiliates of Bayou City Energy Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Bayou City\u201d), and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Highbridge\u201d), continue to own an aggregate 10% voting interest in AMH GP following the closing. These existing owners were a party to a voting agreement with the AM Contributor and AMH GP, pursuant to which they agreed to vote their interests in AMH GP as directed by the AM Contributor. In connection with the closing of the Transactions, the parties amended and restated the voting agreement to include SRII Opco LP as a party and the existing owners agreed to vote their interests in AMH GP as directed by SRII Opco LP and appoint SRII Opco LP as their respective proxy and attorney-in-fact with respect to any voting matters related to their respective interests in AMH GP. The amended and restated voting agreement will continue in force until SRII Opco LP elects to terminate the agreement or, with respect to each existing owner individually, such existing owner no longer owns a voting interest in AMH GP. The closing of the business combination did not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing our 7.875% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d).\nConsideration\nPursuant to the AM Contribution Agreement, at the closing of the Transactions (the Closing\u201d), the AM Contributor received 138,402,398 common units representing limited partner interests (the Common Units\u201d) in SRII Opco LP. The AM Contributor also acquired from AMR a number of newly issued shares of non-economic capital stock of AMR, designated as Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class C Common Stock\u201d), corresponding to the number of Common Units received by the AM Contributor at the Closing.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the above, for a period of seven years following the Closing, the AM Contributor will be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $800 million in earn-out consideration to be paid in the form of Common Units (and acquire a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock) as specified below if the 20-day volume-weighted average price ( 20-Day VWAP\u201d) of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds the following prices (each such payment, an Earn-Out Payment\u201d):\n\ufeff\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n20-Day\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nVWAP\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nEarn-Out Consideration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n10,714,285 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n9,375,000 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13,888,889 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.00\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12,500,000 Common Units\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe AM Contributor will not be entitled to receive a particular Earn-Out Payment on more than one occasion and, if, on a particular date, the 20-Day VWAP entitles the AM Contributor to more than one Earn-Out Payment (each of which has not been previously paid), the AM Contributor will be entitled to receive each such Earn-Out Payment. The AM Contributor will be entitled to the earn-out consideration described above in connection with certain liquidity events of AMR, including a merger or sale of all or substantially all of AMR's assets, if the consideration paid to holders of Class A Common Stock in connection with such liquidity event is greater than any of the above-specified 20-Day VWAP hurdles.\nAMR also contributed approximately $554 million in cash to us at the Closing. AMR's source for these funds was from the sale of its securities to investors in a public offering and in private placements.\nExchange or Redemption of Common Units\nBeginning 180 days after the Closing, the AM Contributor will have the right to exchange its Common Units for shares of AMR Class A Common Stock or cash (at AMR's election). Upon any redemption of Common Units by the AM Contributor, a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock owned by the AM Contributor will be cancelled.\nAmended Limited Partnership and Limited Liability Company Agreements\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination on February 9, 2018, AMH GP and SRII Opco LP entered into a Seventh Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Alta Mesa (the Seventh Amended Partnership Agreement\u201d). The Seventh Amended Partnership Agreement reflects, among other things, that SRII Opco LP is now the sole limited partner of Alta Mesa.\nIn addition, on February 9, 2018, the owners of AMH GP entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of AMH GP (the Sixth Amended LLC Agreement\u201d), which was amended to, reflect that SRII Opco LP, now the holder of all of the Class A Units (as defined therein) is entitled to 100% of the economic rights with respect to AMH GP, and that SRII Opco LP is now the holder of 90% of the Class B Units (as defined therein) which are entitled to 100% of the voting rights with respect to AMH GP.\nAs described above, on February 9, 2018, all of the owners of AMH GP entered into an amended and restated voting agreement (the Voting Agreement\u201d) regarding the voting of their interests in AMH GP.\nAppointment and Departure of Directors\nIn connection with the business combination, Michael A. McCabe, Homer Gene\u201d Cole, Mickey Ellis, Don Dimitrievich, William W. McMullen and Mark Stoner resigned from the board of AMH GP. Harlan H. Chappelle and Michael E. Ellis remain directors on the board of AMH GP. In connection with the business combination, James T. Hackett was appointed to the board of AMH GP. Our executive management team remains the same, except that Mr. Hackett is now Chairman of the Board.\nDistribution of Non-Stack Assets\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination, we have completed our transition from a diversified asset base composed of a portfolio of conventional assets to an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK. On February 8, 2018, we distributed the remainder of our non-STACK assets to AM Contributor as a dividend. At the time of the disposition, our management estimated the carrying value of our remaining non-STACK assets to be $42.8 million with liabilities of $52.5 million, which liabilities include $44.6 million of asset retirement obligations.\nAmended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination, we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility is for an aggregate maximum credit amount of $1.0 billion with an initial $350.0 million borrowing base limit. The Eighth A&R credit facility does not permit us to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing we are not in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants. As of February 9, 2018, all outstanding balances under our credit facility were paid in full.\nFor further details of the business combinations please Note 19 - Subsequent Events in the consolidated financial statements.\nWeeks Island Sale\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold our oil and natural gas assets in the Weeks Island field. Results of operations for the Weeks Island field are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See Note 6 - Discontinued Operations to consolidated financial statements for details. Operating revenues and expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in the Weeks Island.\nResults of Operations\nSelected Operating Data.

The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to higher prices as well as increased production volumes. The average price of oil exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 22% in 2017 resulting in an increase in oil revenues of approximately $37.1 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 29% from $68.96 per Bbl in 2016 to $49.13 per Bbl in 2017. An increase in production of 1,263 MBbls, or 43% resulted in an approximate $51.2 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil volumes is primarily due to new production from the STACK, which increased 1,337 MBbls, from 2,570 MBbls in 2016 to 3,907 MBbls in 2017, partially offset by decreased production from non-STACK fields due to natural decline.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 61%, to $47.6 million in 2017 from $29.5 million in 2016. The increase in natural gas revenue was attributable to increased production volumes as well as higher prices during 2017. An increase in production of 4.7 Bcf, or 35% resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $10.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in natural gas volumes is attributable to new production from the STACK, which increased 5.7 Bcfe, from 8.2 Bcfe in 2016 to 13.9 Bcfe in 2017. This increase was partially offset by decreased production from non-STACK fields due to natural decline. The average price of natural gas exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 20% in 2017 resulting in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $7.7 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 12% from $2.69 per Mcf in 2016 to $3.01 per Mcf in 2017.\nNatural gas liquids revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 116% to $33.8 million in 2017 from $15.7 million in 2016. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in prices as well as increased volumes. The average price of natural gas liquids exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 49%, from $16.38 per Bbl in 2016 to $24.36 per Bbl in 2017 resulting in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $11.0 million. An increase in volumes of 431 MBbls or 45% resulted in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $7.1 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in natural gas liquid volumes is due primarily to an increase in output in the STACK, which increased 454 MBbls, from 823 MBbls in 2016 to 1,277 MBbls in 2017. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes from other non-STACK fields.\nOther revenues were $6.0 million during 2017 as compared to $2.6 million during 2016. Other revenues include salt water disposal fees charged to outside working interest owners. The salt water disposal fees were reclassified from lease operating expense. The fees increased from $2.1 million in 2016 to $5.7 million in 2017.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets was a gain of $3.5 million in 2016 as a result of the sale of South Louisiana properties in 2016.\nGain on acquisition of oil and gas properties was a gain of $3.3 million in 2017, primarily related to the acquisitions of proved STACK oil and natural gas properties from Brown and Borelli, et al ( B&B\u201d) and Sentanta Energy, LLC. The bargain purchase gains recognized related to acquisitions which were accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations during the year ended December 31, 2017 (Refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts was a gain of $8.3 million in 2017 inclusive of net derivative settlements received of $4.1 million in 2017 that included a gain of $5.8 million on contracts prior to expiry. This compared to a loss of $40.5 million in 2016 inclusive of net derivative settlements received of $88.7 million in 2016 that included a gain of $64.0 million on contracts prior to expiry. The significant fluctuation from period to period is due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedge contracts during these periods.\nExpenses\nLease and plant operating expense increased $14.5 million to $60.9 million, or 31% in 2017 as compared to $46.4 million in 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased production volume and increased compression, salt water disposal, chemicals, repairs and maintenance and fuel and power totaling $12.4 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expense decreased 7% from $7.62 to $7.10 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nMarketing and transportation expense increased $17.7 million to $30.5 million in 2017 as compared to $12.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily in the STACK due to increased throughput at the Kingfisher processing facility beginning in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the increase is due to higher marketing and transportation fee charged to provide effective gathering, efficient processing and assurance that our production will continue to flow as the activity in the basin expands at the Kingfisher processing facility. On a per unit basis, marketing and transportation expense increased from $2.11 to $3.56 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes increased $3.0 million to $7.2 million, or 73%, for 2017, as compared to $4.2 million for 2016. Production taxes increased $3.0 million primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas revenues. Ad valorem taxes\nremained flat year over year. On a per unit basis, the production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.68 to $0.84 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nWorkover expense increased $2.3 million to $5.8 million from $3.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is attributable to many different properties.\nExploration expense includes the costs of our geology department, costs of geological and geophysical data, delay rentals, expired leases, and dry holes. Exploration expense decreased $0.2 million to $24.6 million in 2017 from $24.8 million in 2016. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily due to decreases in lease rental expenses and G&G seismic expenses of $5.3 million, partially offset by an increase in dry hole expense and settlements of our asset retirement obligations in excess of our estimate of $5.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, our property, plant, and equipment balance includes $2.0 million in exploratory well costs which are deferred, pending determination of proved reserves. Such costs will be charged to exploration expense if the wells are ultimately classified as dry holes.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $29.5 million to $94.5 million for 2017 as compared to $65.0 million for 2016. On a per unit basis, this expense increased 3% from $10.67 to $11.02 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively. The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and production by field.\nImpairment expense increased $14.0 million to $30.3 million in 2017 from $16.3 million in 2016. This non-cash expense varies with the results of exploratory and development drilling, as well as with well performance and price declines which may render some projects uneconomic, resulting in impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Impairment\u201d below for more details related to impairment. Certain developed fields were impaired due to downward revisions in reserves based on lower commodity prices, performance, development drilling results that were below expectations or high operating costs. Certain undeveloped leasehold costs were impaired as the Company changed its strategic plans on future development in certain areas. The impairments in 2017 were primarily due to write-downs of both unproved oil and natural gas costs and developed fields, primarily in the non-STACK assets. The impairments in 2016 were primarily due to write-downs in developed fields on non-STACK assets, most notably in the Northwest, East Texas and South Louisiana, totaling $15.4 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $13.8 million to $55.6 million in 2017 from $41.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily due to consulting fees attributable to the business combination of approximately $7.7 million, an increase in information technology consulting fees of $1.2 million and settlement expense of $4.2 million. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% from $6.86 to $6.48 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest expense, net decreased $9.4 million to $50.6 million in 2017 from $60.0 million in 2016. The interest on our senior term loan facility decreased $9.2 million as it was repaid in full during the fourth quarter 2016 and interest on our senior secured credit facility decreased $1.0 million due to a decrease in average outstanding balances during the year. In addition, deferred financing costs associated with the senior term loan facility decreased $1.1 million. The decrease was partially offset by the repurchase and redemption of our $450 million aggregate principal amount of 9.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018 by issuing $500 million aggregate principal amount 7.875% senior unsecured notes due 2024, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $2.1 million.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $18.2 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of our $450 million outstanding 2018 Notes for an aggregate cost of $459.4 million, including accrued interest and fees. We recognized a loss related to the repurchase of $13.5 million, which included unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $4.1 million. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility of $127.7 million, which includes accrued interest and a prepayment premium of $2.5 million. We recognized a loss related to the repayment of $4.7 million, which included unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $2.0 million.\nLoss on discontinued operations was $21.4 million in 2017 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $2.3 million in 2016. The increase in the loss on discontinued operations was primarily related to the loss from the sale of assets recognized of $22.2 million.\nResults of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2016 v.

entered into derivative contracts for natural gas liquids in the fourth quarter of 2015. The derivative contracts for natural gas liquids became effective in 2016. \nRevenues\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $12.3 million, or 9%, to $117.7 million in 2016 from $130.0 million in 2015. The decrease in oil revenue was primarily attributable to lower prices, partially offset by increased production volumes. The average price of oil exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 12% in 2016 resulting in a decrease in oil revenues of approximately $16.5 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 10% from $76.39 per Bbl in 2015 to $68.96 per Bbl in 2016. An increase in production of 91 MBbls, or 3% resulted in an approximate $4.2 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil volumes is primarily by new production from the STACK, which increased 564 MBbls, from 2,006 MBbls in 2015 to 2,570 MBbls in 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreased volume to the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 430 MBbls and natural production decline related to our non-STACK assets.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.1 million, or 12%, to $29.5 million in 2016 from $26.4 million in 2015. The increase in natural gas revenue was attributable to increased production volumes partially offset by lower prices during 2016. An increase in production of 2.9 Bcf, or 28% resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $7.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in natural gas volumes is attributable to new production from the STACK, which increased 3.9 Bcfe, from 4.3 Bcfe in 2015 to 8.2 Bcfe in 2016. This increase was partially offset by natural production decline related to our non-STACK assets and the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 415 MMcf. The average price of natural gas exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 13% in 2016 resulting in a decrease in natural gas revenues of approximately $4.3 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 42% from $4.63 per Mcf in 2015 to $2.69 per Mcf in 2016.\nNatural gas liquids revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4.8 million, or 44% to $15.7 million in 2016 from $10.9 million in 2015. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue was primarily attributable to increased volumes as well as an increase in prices. An increase in volumes of 278 MBbls or 41% resulted in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $4.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in natural gas liquid volumes is due primarily to an increase in output in the STACK, which increased 324 MBbls, from 499 MBbls in 2015 to 823 MBbls in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes due to the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 84 MBbls. The average price of natural gas liquids exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 2%, from $16.01 per Bbl in 2015 to $16.38 per Bbl in 2016 resulting in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $0.4 million.\nOther revenues were $2.6 million during 2016 as compared to $0.7 million during 2015. Other revenues include salt water disposal fees charged to outside working interest owners. The salt water disposal fees were reclassified from lease operating expense. The fees increased from $0.0 million in 2015 to $2.1 million in 2016.\nGain on sale of assets was a gain of $3.5 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of $67.8 million in 2015. The sale of South Louisiana properties in 2016 resulted in a gain of $3.5 million. The sale of our remaining Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 resulted in a gain of $67.6 million.\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts was a loss of $40.5 million inclusive of derivative settlements received of $88.7 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of $124.1 million inclusive of derivative settlements received of $106.9 million in 2015. The significant fluctuation from period to period is due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedge contracts during these periods.\nExpenses\nLease and plant operating expense decreased $7.4 million to $46.4 million, or 14% in 2016 as compared to $53.8 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salt water disposal, repairs and maintenance, and field services, totaling $6.6 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expense decreased 26% from $10.28 to $7.62 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nMarketing and transportation expense increased $9.7 million to $12.8 million in 2016 as compared to $3.1 million in 2015. The increase is primarily in the STACK due to increased throughput at the Kingfisher processing facility beginning in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the increase is due to higher marketing and transportation fee charged to provide effective gathering, efficient processing and assurance that our production will continue to flow as the activity in the basin expands at the Kingfisher processing facility. On a per unit basis, marketing and transportation expense increased from $0.60 to $2.11 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes decreased $2.1 million to $4.2 million, or 34%, for 2016, as compared to $6.3 million for 2015. Production taxes decreased $1.6 million primarily due to the decrease in oil revenues. Ad valorem taxes decreased $0.5 million. On a per unit basis, the production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $1.20 to $0.68 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nWorkover expense decreased $1.7 million to $3.5 million from $5.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is attributable to many different properties.\nExploration expense includes the costs of our geology department, costs of geological and geophysical data, delay rentals, expired leases, and dry holes. Exploration expense decreased $4.7 million to $24.8 million in 2016 from $29.5 million in 2015. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily due to decreases in dry hole expense and G&G seismic expenses of $11.7 million, partially offset by an increase in expired leasehold and settlements of our asset retirement obligations in excess of our estimates of $7.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, our property, plant, and equipment balance includes $2.1 million in exploratory well costs which are deferred, pending determination of proved reserves. Such costs will be charged to exploration expense if the wells are ultimately classified as dry holes.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $13.0 million to $65.0 million for 2016 as compared to $78.0 million for 2015. On a per unit basis, this expense decreased 28% from $14.89 to $10.67 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and production by field.\nImpairment expense decreased $34.1 million to $16.3 million in 2016 from $50.4 million in 2015. This non-cash expense varies with the results of exploratory and development drilling, as well as with well performance and price declines which may render some projects uneconomic, resulting in impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Impairment\u201d below for more details related to impairment. Certain developed fields were impaired due to downward revisions in reserves based on lower commodity prices, performance or development drilling results that were below expectations. The impairments in 2016 were primarily due to write-downs in developed fields related to our non-STACK assets, totaling $15.4 million. The impairments in 2015 were primarily due to write-downs of both unproved oil and natural gas costs and developed fields, primarily in East Texas, the STACK, and South Louisiana, totaling $34.2 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $2.7 million to $41.8 million in 2016 from $44.5 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower litigation settlement expenses recorded in 2016 as compared to 2015 of $5.3 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries, benefits and deferred compensation of $2.6 million in 2016. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 19% from $8.49 to $6.86 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.8 million to $60.0 million in 2016 from $61.8 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the tender and redemption of the 2018 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2016, which decreased interest costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and senior term loan facility. The senior term loan facility was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense incurred on our borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility increased $1.4 million due to an increase in average outstanding balance. Interest expense incurred on our borrowing under senior secured term loan facility increased $3.0 million as we recognized almost a full year of interest expense and additional amortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million as compared to prior year. We entered into the senior secured term loan facility during the second quarter of 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt was $18.2 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of our $450 million outstanding 2018 Notes for an aggregate cost of $459.4 million, including accrued interest and fees. We recognized a loss related to the repurchase of $13.5 million, which included unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $4.1 million. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility of $127.7 million, which includes accrued interest and a prepayment premium of $2.5 million. We recognized a loss related to the repayment of $4.7 million, which included unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $2.0 million.\nLoss on discontinued operations was $2.3 million in 2016 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $157.3 million in 2015. The decreased in the loss on discontinued operations was primarily due to a decrease in impairment expense recognized. Weeks Island field recognized impairment expense of approximately $20,000 during 2016 as compared to $126.3 million during 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal requirements for capital are to fund our day-to-day operations, our exploration and development activities, and to satisfy our contractual obligations, primarily for the payment of debt principal and interest and any amounts owed during the period related to our hedging positions.\nOur 2017 capital budget was primarily focused on the development of our STACK properties through exploitation and development. We spent approximately $369.6 million in 2017 on capital expenditures, including acquisitions, of which $356 million was spent in the STACK. The capital expenditures for 2017 reflected our plans to drill wells that were funded through the joint development agreement with BCE. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we have received approximately $92.7 million from BCE under our joint development agreement. We increased our capital budget for 2018 from 2017 levels in response to the improvement in the current commodity price environment. Our future drilling plans, plans of our drilling operators and capital budgets are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas\nprices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, actions of our operators, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. A deferral of planned capital expenditures, particularly with respect to drilling and completing new wells, could result in a reduction in anticipated production, revenues and cash flows. Additionally, if we curtail our drilling program, we may lose a portion of our acreage through lease expirations. However, because a large percentage of our acreage is held by production, we have the ability to materially increase or decrease our drilling and recompletion budget in response to market conditions with decreased risk of losing significant acreage. In addition, we may be required to reclassify some portion of our reserves currently booked as proved undeveloped reserves to no longer be proved reserves if such a deferral of planned capital expenditures means we will be unable to develop such reserves within five years of their initial booking.\nWe funded our 2017 capital expenditures predominantly with cash flows from operations, drilling and completion of capital funded through our joint development agreement with BCE, capital contribution of $200 million by Riverstone and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending. Subsequent to year end and in connection with the closing of the business combination, Alta Mesa Resources contributed an additional $554 million to us.\nWe expect to fund our capital budget in 2018 and beyond predominantly with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and drilling and completion capital funded through our joint development agreement with BCE. As we execute our business strategy, we will continually monitor the capital resources available to meet future financial obligations and planned capital expenditures. We believe our cash flows provided by operating activities, cash on hand and availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility will provide us with the financial flexibility and wherewithal to meet our cash requirements, including normal operating needs, and pursue our currently planned and future development drilling activities. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties and acquire additional properties. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nSenior Notes\nWe have $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes, or the senior notes\u201d, due December 15, 2024 which were issued at par by us and our wholly owned subsidiary Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp. (collectively, the Issuers\u201d) during the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2017. At any time prior to December 15, 2019, we may, from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes in an amount of cash not greater than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price of 107.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 120 days of the closing date of such equity offering. At any time prior to December 15, 2019, we may, on any one or more occasions, redeem all or part of the senior notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of change of control, each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. On and after December 15, 2019, we may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 105.906% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2019, 103.938% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2020, 101.969% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2021 and 100.000% beginning on December 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\nSubsequent to year end, the closing of the business combination with Alta Mesa Resources did not constitute as a change of control under the indenture governing the senior notes because certain existing owners of the Company and SRII Opco LP entered into the Voting Agreement with respect to the voting interests in AMH GP. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nThe senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our material subsidiaries, subject to certain customary release provisions. Accordingly, they will rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness; senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the senior notes or the respective guarantees; effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and obligations of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes.\nThe senior notes contain certain covenants limiting the Issuers' ability and the ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to, under certain circumstances, prepay subordinated indebtedness, pay distributions, redeem stock or make certain restricted investments; incur indebtedness; create liens on the Issuers' assets to secure debt; restrict dividends, distributions or other payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of restricted subsidiaries; effect a consolidation or merger; and change our line of business.\nThe indenture contains customary events of default, including:\n \ufeff \uf0b7 default in any payment of interest on the senior notes when due, continued for 30 days; \ufeff \uf0b7 default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the senior notes when due; \n \ufeff \uf0b7 failure by the Issuers or any subsidiary guarantor to comply with its obligations under the indenture; \ufeff \uf0b7 default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuers or restricted subsidiaries; \n \ufeff \uf0b7 certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuers or restricted subsidiaries; and \ufeff \uf0b7 failure by the Issuers or certain subsidiaries that would constitute a payment of final judgment aggregating in excess of $20.0 million. \nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 9, 2018, we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility is for an aggregate of $1.0 billion with an initial $350.0 million borrowing base limit. The Eighth A&R credit facility does not permit us to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing we are not in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants.\n\ufeff\nAs of March 29, 2018, we have no outstanding borrowings under the Eighth A&R and have $13.6 million of outstanding letters of credit reimbursement obligations.\nThe principal amounts borrowed are payable on the maturity date on February 9, 2023. We have a choice of borrowing in Eurodollars or at the reference rate, with such borrowings bearing interest, payable quarterly for reference rate loans and one month, three month or six month periods for Eurodollar loans. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate at the LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%. Reference rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank's reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. The next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is on April 1, 2018. The borrowing base may be reduced in connection with the next redetermination of its borrowing base. The amounts outstanding under the Eighth A&R credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Company's and its material operating subsidiaries' oil and natural gas properties and associated assets and all of the stock of our material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Eighth A&R credit facility. Additionally, SRII Opco, LP and AMH GP have pledged their respective limited partner interests in us as security for our obligations. If an event of default occurs under the Eighth A&R credit facility, the administrative agent will have the right to proceed against the pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets and our material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors.\nThe Eighth A&R credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, guaranty or make loans to others, make investments, enter into mergers, make certain payments and distributions, enter into or be party to hedge agreements, amend our organizational documents, incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. The Eighth A&R credit facility permits us to make distributions to any parent entity (i) to pay for reimbursement of third party costs and expenses that are general and administrative expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business by such parent entity or (ii) in order to permit such parent entity to (x) make permitted tax distributions and (y) pay the obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below).\nThe Eighth A&R credit facility also requires us to maintain the following two financial ratios:\n urirur \u2022 a current ratio, tested quarterly, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, of our consolidated current assets to our consolidated current liabilities of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter; and \n\ufeff\n \ufeff \u2022 a leverage ratio, tested quarterly, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, of our consolidated debt (other than obligations under hedge agreements) as of the end of such fiscal quarter to its consolidated EBITDAX annualized by multiplying EBITDAX for the period of (A) the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018 times 4, (B) the two fiscal quarter periods ending September 30, 2018 times 2 and (C) the three fiscal quarter periods ending December 31, 2018 times 4/3rds and (D) for each fiscal quarter on or after March 31, 2019, EBITDAX times 4/4, of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nOperating activities (including operating activities from discontinued operations) provided cash of $59.3 million in 2017, as compared to $131.7 million in 2016. Of the $59.3 million and $131.7 million cash provided by operating activities in 2017 and 2016, discontinued operations provided cash of approximately $21.2 million and 27.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $72.4 million decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to various factors. Cash-based items of net income, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $8.4 million in earnings and a negative impact on cash flow. The changes in our working capital accounts used $64.0 million in cash as compared to having provided $23.8 million in cash in 2016.\nOperating activities (including operating activities from discontinued operations) provided cash of $131.7 million in 2016, as compared to $144.0 million in 2015. The $12.3 million decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to various factors. Cash-based items of net income, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $36.1 million in earnings and a negative impact on cash flow. The changes in our working capital accounts provided $23.8 million in cash as compared to having provided $4.5 million in cash in 2015.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities (including investing activities from discontinued operations) used cash of $345.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for property and equipment, including acquisitions used cash of $369.6 million and $225.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we entered into an interest bearing promissory note receivable with our affiliate Northwest Gas Processing, LLC for approximately $1.5 million in 2017. The cash used for investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Weeks Island field and other assets of approximately $25.2 million.\nInvesting activities (including investing activities from discontinued operations) used cash of $224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to proceeds from the sale of property in 2015 of approximately $141.4 million. The increase in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by decreased expenditures for drilling and development and decreased acquisitions in 2016.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $283.9 million during 2017 as compared to cash provided of $91.2 million during 2016, an increase of $192.7 million. During 2017, we drew down $76.4 million, net of payments, under our senior secured revolving credit facility and we paid $0.4 million of deferred financing costs related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and senior notes. During 2017, Riverstone was admitted as a limited partner in connection with its $200 million contribution to us. In addition, we received $7.9 million in capital contributions from our former Class B limited partner, High Mesa.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $91.2 million during 2016 as compared to cash used of $30.6 million during 2015, an increase of $121.8 million. During 2016, we used proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes of $500.0 million, capital contributions from our Class B limited partner of $303.5 million and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility of $222.6 million to repay $459.4 million on the 2018 Notes, repay $127.7 million on our senior secured term loan facility and pay down $333.9 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility. In addition, we incurred $13.7 million of deferred financing costs.\nRisk Management Activities - Commodity Derivative Instruments\nDue to the risk of low oil and natural gas prices, we periodically enter into price-risk management transactions (e.g., swaps, collars, puts, calls, and financial basis swap contracts) for a portion of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production. In certain cases, this allows us to achieve a more predictable cash flow, as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations. The commodity derivative instruments apply to only a portion of our production, and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices, and may partially limit our potential gains from future increases in prices. At December 31, 2017, commodity derivative instruments were in place covering approximately 69% of our projected oil production and, approximately 1% of our natural gas production from proved developed properties for 2018.

The weighted average rate on our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017 of 5.48% was utilized to calculate the projected interest for our senior secured revolving credit facility. Projected obligation amounts are based on the payment schedules for interest, and are not presented on an accrual basis. On February 9, 2018, and in connection with the closing of the business combination (as described in Note 19 - Subsequent Events), we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility extended our maturity date from November 2020 to February 2023. As of February 9, 2018, all outstanding balances under our credit facility were paid in full. In addition, our founder converted the founder notes into equity interests in the AM Contributor immediately prior to the closing of the business combination with AMR. \n (2) The drilling rigs are included at the gross contractual value. Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation. Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed. The drillings rigs are utilized in drilling wells that may or may not be included as part of our joint development agreement with BCE. \n (3) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017 we had no guarantees of third-party obligations. Our off-balance sheet obligations include the obligations under operating leases, and the $2.2 million contingent properties payment for properties acquired in 2008 and prior years. We also have bonds posted in the aggregate amount of $17.4 million, primarily to cover future abandonment costs, and $13.6 million in letters of credit provided under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We typically enter into short-term drilling contracts which are customary in the oil and gas industry. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe have no plans to enter into any additional off-balance sheet arrangements in the foreseeable future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). As used herein, the following acronyms have the following meanings: FASB\u201d means the Financial Accounting Standards Board; the Codification\u201d refers to the Accounting Standards Codification, the collected accounting and reporting guidance maintained by the FASB; ASC\u201d means Accounting Standards Codification and is generally followed by a number indicating a particular section of the Codification; and ASU\u201d means Accounting Standards Update, followed by an identification number, which are the periodic updates made to the Codification by the FASB.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.\nEmerging growth company. We are classified as an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among\nother things: (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues at the end of any fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates measured as of June 30, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\ufeff\nReserve estimates significantly impact depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and impairments of oil and natural gas properties and are subject to change based on changes in oil and natural gas prices and trends and changes in estimated reserve quantities. Other significant estimates include those related to oil and natural gas reserves, the value of oil and natural gas properties (including acquisition properties), oil and natural gas revenues, bad debts, asset retirement obligations, derivative contracts, state taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review estimates and underlying assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nProperty and Equipment. Oil and natural gas producing activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under the successful efforts method, lease acquisition costs and all development costs, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\nUnproved Properties - Acquisition costs associated with the acquisition of leases are recorded as unproved properties and capitalized as incurred. These consist of costs incurred in obtaining a mineral interest or right in a property, such as a lease in addition to options to lease, broker fees, recording fees and other similar costs related to activities in acquiring properties. Unproved properties are classified as unproved until proved reserves are discovered, at which time related costs are transferred to proved oil and natural gas properties.\nExploration Expense - Exploration expenses, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense as incurred. These expenses include seismic expenditures and other geological and geophysical costs, expired leases, and lease rentals. The costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic wells are initially capitalized pending determination of whether the well has discovered proved commercial reserves. If the exploratory well is determined to be unsuccessful, the cost of the well is transferred to expense. Exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Properties - Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering, and storing oil and natural gas are capitalized. All costs incurred to drill and equip successful exploratory wells, development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\nImpairment - The capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed at least quarterly for impairment following the guidance provided in ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Subsequent Measurement, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value and is not recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on comparing the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows at a producing field level to the carrying value of the assets. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on estimates of anticipated production from proved reserves and future crude oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, are lower than the carrying cost, the carrying cost of the asset or group of assets is reduced to fair value. For our proved oil and natural gas properties, we estimate fair value by discounting the projected future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.\nUnproved properties are assessed at least annually to determine whether they have been impaired. Individually significant properties are assessed for impairment on a property-by-property basis, while individually insignificant unproved leasehold costs may be assessed in the aggregate. If unproved leasehold costs are found to be impaired, an impairment allowance is provided and a loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization - Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) of capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method based upon estimated proved reserves. Assets are grouped for DD&A on the basis of reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. The reserve base used to calculate DD&A for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to\ncalculate DD&A for lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, includes only proved developed reserves.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues when products are delivered at a fixed or determinable price, title has transferred and collectability is reasonably assured. We use the sales method of accounting for recognition of natural gas imbalances.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. We use derivative contracts to hedge the effects of fluctuations in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We account for such derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d which establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and requires them to be measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 6 for information on fair value).\nUnder ASC 815, hedge accounting is used to defer recognition of unrealized changes in the fair value of such financial instruments, for those contracts which qualify as fair value or cash flow hedges, as defined in the guidance. Historically, we have not designated any of our derivative contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the contracts are included in earnings as Gain (loss) on derivative contracts.\u201d Cash flows from settlements of derivative contracts are classified as operating cash flows.\nIncome Taxes. We have elected under the Internal Revenue Code provisions to be treated as individual partnerships for tax purposes. Accordingly, items of income, expense, gains and losses flow through to the partners and are taxed at the partner level. Accordingly, no tax provision for federal operations taxes is included in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to the Texas margin tax, which is considered a state income tax, and is included in Provision for state income tax\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations. We record state income tax (current and deferred) based on taxable income as defined under the rules for the margin tax.\nAcquisitions. Acquisitions are accounted for as purchases using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the closing date of the acquisitions. Purchase prices are allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair value at the time of the acquisition.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We estimate the present value of future costs of dismantlement and abandonment of our wells, facilities, and other tangible, long-lived assets, recording them as liabilities in the period incurred. We follow ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. ASC 410 requires that an asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred or becomes determinable (as defined by the standard), with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash outflows for abandonment discounted generally at our cost of capital at the time of recognition.\nInvestments. Our investment consists of a 10.17% ownership interest in a drilling company, Orion Drilling Company, LLC ( Orion\u201d). The investment is accounted for under the cost method and we have recorded $9.0 million of Investment in LLC on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Under this method, our share of earnings or losses of the investment are not included in the consolidated statements of operations. Distributions from Orion are recognized in current period earnings as declared.\nPrior to the Closing, Alta Mesa was a part owner of AEM with an ownership interest of less than 10%. AEM markets our oil and natural gas and sells it under short-term contracts generally with month-to-month pricing based on published regional indices, with differentials for transportation, location, and quality taken into account. AEM remits monthly collections of these sales to us, and receives a 1% marketing fee.\nDeferred Financing Costs. The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing. These costs are amortized over the term of the related financing using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The amortization expense is recorded as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which seeks to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers concerning the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from those contracts. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued various clarifications and interpretive guidance to assist entities with implementation efforts, including guidance pertaining to the presentation of revenues on a gross basis (revenues presented separately from associated expenses) versus a net basis.\nASU 2014-09 and related interpretive guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, except for emerging growth companies that elect to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards pursuant to Section 7(a)(2)(b) of the Securities Act. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as necessary. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\ufeff\nWe are in the process of assessing our contracts and evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as it relates to certain sales contracts, and in particular, as it relates to disclosure requirements. In addition, we are evaluating the impact, if any, on the presentation of our future revenues and expenses under the new gross-versus-net presentation guidance. We continue to evaluate the impact of these and other provisions of ASU 2014-09 on our accounting policies, changes to relevant business practices, internal controls, and consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which supersedes ASC 840 Leases\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 842 Leases.\u201d The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents a lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 also requires disclosures designed to provide information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land easement practical expedient for transition to Topic 842 ( ASU 2018-01\u201d), which provides an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounting for as leases under Topic 840, Leases. The standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for all other entities, with earlier adoption permitted. In the normal course of business, we enter into operating lease agreements to support our exploration and development operations and lease assets such as drilling rigs, well equipment, compressors, office space and other assets.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial statements; however, the adoption and impletion of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in an increase in both the assets and liabilities relating to our operating lease activities greater than twelve months. The adoption is also expected to result in increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and interest expense and a reduction in rent expense recorded on our consolidated statement of operations, and additional disclosures. As part of our assessment to date, we have formed an implementation work team and will complete our evaluation in 2018. As we continue to evaluate and implement the standard, we plan to provide additional information about the expected financial impact at a future date. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during 2020. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard on January 1, 2019.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for all other entities. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during 2019. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance will not impact our financial position or results of operations but could result in presentation changes on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents on the statements of cash flows and to provide a reconciliation of the totals in that statement to the related captions in the balance sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2018 for private companies, and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2016-18 in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies for further details.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2017 for public companies and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for all other entities. The amendments should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date and disclosures are not required at transition. Early adoption is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-01 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however these amendments could result in the recording of fewer business combinations in the future periods.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, production timing and volumes, estimates of proved reserves, operating costs and capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. As a result of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.\nOverview\nWe have been engaged in the onshore oil and natural gas acquisition, exploitation, exploration and production business in the United States since 1987. Currently, we are focusing on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the STACK. We have transitioned our focus from our diversified asset base composed of a portfolio of conventional assets to an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK with an extensive inventory of drilling opportunities. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we have assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations primarily target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego formations. We continue to opportunistically acquire acreage in our non-operated locations with the goal of operating wells in these locations. At present, we have seven operated horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase to eight rigs by the end of 2018.\nThe amount of revenue we generate from our operations will fluctuate based on, among other things:\n \u00b7 the prices at which we will sell our production; \n \u00b7 the amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce; and \n \u00b7 the level of our operating and administrative costs. \nCommodity prices remain unpredictable. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. In order to mitigate the impact of changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices on our cash flows, we are a party to hedging and other price protection contracts, and we intend to enter into such transactions in the future to reduce the effect of price volatility on our cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, amounts presented reflect our proportionate interest in such activities. Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in the future.\nOutlook\nOur revenue, profitability and future growth depend on many factors, particularly the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which are beyond our control. The success of our business is significantly affected by the price of oil due to our current focus on development of oil reserves and exploration for oil. Our industry has been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices in recent years.\nCommodity prices remained volatile, but generally increased on average in 2017 relative to 2016 in response to improving supply and demand of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and other factors. Oil prices in particular showed significant signs of improvement in early 2018, with NYMEX West Texas Intermediate ( NYMEX WTI\u201d) reaching $66.14 per barrel on January 26, 2018. The NYMEX WTI monthly settlement price averaged approximately $50.95 per Bbl in 2017 as compared to an average price of $43.32 per Bbl in 2016. NYMEX Henry Hub monthly settlement price for natural gas averaged approximately $3.11 per MMBtu in 2017 as compared to a monthly settlement average price of $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016. On March 20, 2018, NYMEX WTI was $63.40 per barrel and NYMEX Henry Hub was $2.68 per MMBtu. Factors affecting oil prices include worldwide economic conditions, including the European credit markets; geopolitical activities, including developments in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere; worldwide supply conditions; weather conditions; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the value of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Commodity prices remain unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the increase in market prices experienced in recent months will be sustained. If oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices decrease, such decrease could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the carrying value of our oil and\nnatural gas properties, our proved reserves and our ability to finance operations, including the amount of our borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nWe have increased our anticipated capital expenditures for 2018 to $568 million. Additionally, we anticipate that up to an additional $25 million will be funded for 2018 drilling and completions activity in the STACK by BCE pursuant to our joint development agreement. Following the business combination, we have allocated all of our 2018 capital expenditures to develop the STACK. We anticipate operating up to eight drilling rigs by the end of 2018, which will result in drilling a total of approximately 173 gross wells in the STACK.\nOur derivative contracts are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are highly sensitive to changes in the price of oil and natural gas. Changes in these derivative assets and liabilities are reported in our consolidated statement of operations as gain / loss on derivative contracts which include both the non-cash increase / decrease in the fair value of derivative contracts, as well as the effect of cash settlements of derivative contracts during the period. In 2017, we recognized a net gain on our derivative contracts of $8.3 million, which includes $4.1 million in cash settlements received for derivative contracts. The objective of our hedging program is that, over time, the combination of settlement gains and losses from derivative contracts with ordinary oil and natural gas revenues will produce relative revenue stability. However, in the short term, both settlements and fair value changes in our derivative contracts can significantly impact our results of operations, and we expect these gains and losses to continue to reflect changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nCurrently, we have hedged approximately 45% of our forecasted production of proved developed producing reserves through 2020 at weighted average annual floor prices ranging from $50.00 per Bbl to $52.22 per Bbl for oil and $2.80 per MMBtu to $2.90 per MMBtu for natural gas. If oil and/or natural gas prices continue to decline for an extended period of time, we may be unable to replace expiring hedge contracts or enter new contracts for additional oil and natural gas production at favorable prices.\nDepressed oil and natural gas prices have impacted our earnings by necessitating impairment write-downs in some of our properties, either directly by decreasing the market values of the properties, or indirectly, by lowering rates of return on oil and natural gas development projects and increasing the chance of impairment write-downs. We recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $30.3 million, $16.3 million and $50.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 write-downs were primarily due unproved leasehold costs that were either expired or will be expiring where the Company had no plans for future development, downward revisions in proved reserves and higher operating costs related to our non-STACK assets. Our impairments were primarily related to our oil and natural gas properties related to our non-STACK assets.\n\ufeff\nIn the future, we may recognize significant impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties and impairments of unproved oil and natural gas properties as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and changes to our drilling plans. At December 31, 2017, our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas properties with a net book value of approximately $762.2 million indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this depletion group may be at risk for impairment if oil and natural gas prices decline by 10%. We estimate that, if the oil and natural gas decline by 10%, this depletion group could become impaired in a future period and we could recognize non-cash impairments in that period in excess of $2.7 million. It is also reasonably foreseeable that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to our drilling plans in response to lower prices or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments. For further information, see Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017 v. Year Ended December 31, 2016: Impairment Expense.\u201d\nThe primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, the effectiveness and efficiency of our production operations, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, we face the challenge of natural production declines. We attempt to overcome this natural decline primarily through development of our existing undeveloped reserves, enhanced completions and well recompletions, and other enhanced recovery methods. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production. Our ability to add reserves through drilling and other development techniques is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completing or connecting our new wells to gathering lines will negatively affect our production, which will have an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash flow from operations.\nRecent Activity\nBusiness Combination with Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.\nOn August 16, 2017, we entered into a Contribution Agreement (the AM Contribution Agreement\u201d) with Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (formerly Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II, a Delaware corporation ( AMR\u201d)), High Mesa Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the AM Contributor\u201d), High Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and the sole general partner of the AM Contributor, Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and our sole general partner ( AMH GP\u201d), and, solely for certain provisions therein, the equity owners of the AM Contributor. Simultaneous with the execution of the AM Contribution Agreement, AMR entered into (i) a Contribution Agreement (the KFM Contribution Agreement\u201d) with KFM Holdco,\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the KFM Contributor\u201d), Kingfisher Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Kingfisher\u201d), and, solely for certain provisions therein, the equity owners of the KFM Contributor; and (ii) a Contribution Agreement (the Riverstone Contribution Agreement\u201d and, together with the AM Contribution Agreement and the KFM Contribution Agreement, the Contribution Agreements\u201d) with Riverstone VI Alta Mesa Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Riverstone Contributor\u201d).\nOn February 9, 2018 (the Closing Date\u201d), we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreements and SRII Opco LP, a Delaware limited partnership ( SRII Opco LP\u201d) acquired (a) (i) all of the limited partner interests in us and (ii) 100% of the economic interests and 90% of the voting interests in AMH GP (with (i) and (ii) collectively, the AM Contribution\u201d) and (b) 100% of the economic interests in Kingfisher (the Kingfisher Contribution\u201d). The acquisition of us and Kingfisher pursuant to the Contribution Agreements is referred to herein as the business combination\u201d and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreements are referred to herein as the Transactions.\u201d\nSRII Opco GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( SRII Opco GP\u201d), the sole general partner of SRII Opco LP, is a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR. The limited partners of SRII Opco LP are the AM Contributor, the KFM Contributor and the Riverstone Contributor (collectively, the Contributors\u201d), AMR and certain funds managed by Highbridge. As a result of the Transactions, AMR has obtained control over the management of AMH GP and, consequently, us. AMR is a publicly traded corporation that is not under the control of any person. Prior to the closing of the Transactions, AMH GP, and consequently, us, was controlled by High Mesa and indirectly by our founder and Chief Operating Officer Michael E. Ellis.\nHarlan H. Chappelle, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Michael Ellis, our Chief Operating Officer and a director and certain affiliates of Bayou City Energy Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Bayou City\u201d), and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Highbridge\u201d), continue to own an aggregate 10% voting interest in AMH GP following the closing. These existing owners were a party to a voting agreement with the AM Contributor and AMH GP, pursuant to which they agreed to vote their interests in AMH GP as directed by the AM Contributor. In connection with the closing of the Transactions, the parties amended and restated the voting agreement to include SRII Opco LP as a party and the existing owners agreed to vote their interests in AMH GP as directed by SRII Opco LP and appoint SRII Opco LP as their respective proxy and attorney-in-fact with respect to any voting matters related to their respective interests in AMH GP. The amended and restated voting agreement will continue in force until SRII Opco LP elects to terminate the agreement or, with respect to each existing owner individually, such existing owner no longer owns a voting interest in AMH GP. The closing of the business combination did not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing our 7.875% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d).\nConsideration\nPursuant to the AM Contribution Agreement, at the closing of the Transactions (the Closing\u201d), the AM Contributor received 138,402,398 common units representing limited partner interests (the Common Units\u201d) in SRII Opco LP. The AM Contributor also acquired from AMR a number of newly issued shares of non-economic capital stock of AMR, designated as Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class C Common Stock\u201d), corresponding to the number of Common Units received by the AM Contributor at the Closing.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the above, for a period of seven years following the Closing, the AM Contributor will be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $800 million in earn-out consideration to be paid in the form of Common Units (and acquire a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock) as specified below if the 20-day volume-weighted average price ( 20-Day VWAP\u201d) of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds the following prices (each such payment, an Earn-Out Payment\u201d):\n\ufeff\n\nThe AM Contributor will not be entitled to receive a particular Earn-Out Payment on more than one occasion and, if, on a particular date, the 20-Day VWAP entitles the AM Contributor to more than one Earn-Out Payment (each of which has not been previously paid), the AM Contributor will be entitled to receive each such Earn-Out Payment. The AM Contributor will be entitled to the earn-out consideration described above in connection with certain liquidity events of AMR, including a merger or sale of all or substantially all of AMR's assets, if the consideration paid to holders of Class A Common Stock in connection with such liquidity event is greater than any of the above-specified 20-Day VWAP hurdles.\nAMR also contributed approximately $554 million in cash to us at the Closing. AMR's source for these funds was from the sale of its securities to investors in a public offering and in private placements.\nExchange or Redemption of Common Units\nBeginning 180 days after the Closing, the AM Contributor will have the right to exchange its Common Units for shares of AMR Class A Common Stock or cash (at AMR's election). Upon any redemption of Common Units by the AM Contributor, a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock owned by the AM Contributor will be cancelled.\nAmended Limited Partnership and Limited Liability Company Agreements\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination on February 9, 2018, AMH GP and SRII Opco LP entered into a Seventh Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Alta Mesa (the Seventh Amended Partnership Agreement\u201d). The Seventh Amended Partnership Agreement reflects, among other things, that SRII Opco LP is now the sole limited partner of Alta Mesa.\nIn addition, on February 9, 2018, the owners of AMH GP entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of AMH GP (the Sixth Amended LLC Agreement\u201d), which was amended to, reflect that SRII Opco LP, now the holder of all of the Class A Units (as defined therein) is entitled to 100% of the economic rights with respect to AMH GP, and that SRII Opco LP is now the holder of 90% of the Class B Units (as defined therein) which are entitled to 100% of the voting rights with respect to AMH GP.\nAs described above, on February 9, 2018, all of the owners of AMH GP entered into an amended and restated voting agreement (the Voting Agreement\u201d) regarding the voting of their interests in AMH GP.\nAppointment and Departure of Directors\nIn connection with the business combination, Michael A. McCabe, Homer Gene\u201d Cole, Mickey Ellis, Don Dimitrievich, William W. McMullen and Mark Stoner resigned from the board of AMH GP. Harlan H. Chappelle and Michael E. Ellis remain directors on the board of AMH GP. In connection with the business combination, James T. Hackett was appointed to the board of AMH GP. Our executive management team remains the same, except that Mr. Hackett is now Chairman of the Board.\nDistribution of Non-Stack Assets\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination, we have completed our transition from a diversified asset base composed of a portfolio of conventional assets to an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK. On February 8, 2018, we distributed the remainder of our non-STACK assets to AM Contributor as a dividend. At the time of the disposition, our management estimated the carrying value of our remaining non-STACK assets to be $42.8 million with liabilities of $52.5 million, which liabilities include $44.6 million of asset retirement obligations.\nAmended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nIn connection with the closing of the business combination, we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility is for an aggregate maximum credit amount of $1.0 billion with an initial $350.0 million borrowing base limit. The Eighth A&R credit facility does not permit us to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing we are not in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants. As of February 9, 2018, all outstanding balances under our credit facility were paid in full.\nFor further details of the business combinations please Note 19 - Subsequent Events in the consolidated financial statements.\nWeeks Island Sale\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold our oil and natural gas assets in the Weeks Island field. Results of operations for the Weeks Island field are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See Note 6 - Discontinued Operations to consolidated financial statements for details. Operating revenues and expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in the Weeks Island.\nResults of Operations\nSelected Operating Data. The following table sets forth operating data from continuing operations for the periods presented.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017 v. Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\n\nRevenues\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $88.3 million, or 75%, to $206.0 million in 2017 from $117.7 million in 2016. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to higher prices as well as increased production volumes. The average price of oil exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 22% in 2017 resulting in an increase in oil revenues of approximately $37.1 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 29% from $68.96 per Bbl in 2016 to $49.13 per Bbl in 2017. An increase in production of 1,263 MBbls, or 43% resulted in an approximate $51.2 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil volumes is primarily due to new production from the STACK, which increased 1,337 MBbls, from 2,570 MBbls in 2016 to 3,907 MBbls in 2017, partially offset by decreased production from non-STACK fields due to natural decline.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 61%, to $47.6 million in 2017 from $29.5 million in 2016. The increase in natural gas revenue was attributable to increased production volumes as well as higher prices during 2017. An increase in production of 4.7 Bcf, or 35% resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $10.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in natural gas volumes is attributable to new production from the STACK, which increased 5.7 Bcfe, from 8.2 Bcfe in 2016 to 13.9 Bcfe in 2017. This increase was partially offset by decreased production from non-STACK fields due to natural decline. The average price of natural gas exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 20% in 2017 resulting in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $7.7 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 12% from $2.69 per Mcf in 2016 to $3.01 per Mcf in 2017.\nNatural gas liquids revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 116% to $33.8 million in 2017 from $15.7 million in 2016. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in prices as well as increased volumes. The average price of natural gas liquids exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 49%, from $16.38 per Bbl in 2016 to $24.36 per Bbl in 2017 resulting in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $11.0 million. An increase in volumes of 431 MBbls or 45% resulted in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $7.1 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in natural gas liquid volumes is due primarily to an increase in output in the STACK, which increased 454 MBbls, from 823 MBbls in 2016 to 1,277 MBbls in 2017. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes from other non-STACK fields.\nOther revenues were $6.0 million during 2017 as compared to $2.6 million during 2016. Other revenues include salt water disposal fees charged to outside working interest owners. The salt water disposal fees were reclassified from lease operating expense. The fees increased from $2.1 million in 2016 to $5.7 million in 2017.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets was a gain of $3.5 million in 2016 as a result of the sale of South Louisiana properties in 2016.\nGain on acquisition of oil and gas properties was a gain of $3.3 million in 2017, primarily related to the acquisitions of proved STACK oil and natural gas properties from Brown and Borelli, et al ( B&B\u201d) and Sentanta Energy, LLC. The bargain purchase gains recognized related to acquisitions which were accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations during the year ended December 31, 2017 (Refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts was a gain of $8.3 million in 2017 inclusive of net derivative settlements received of $4.1 million in 2017 that included a gain of $5.8 million on contracts prior to expiry. This compared to a loss of $40.5 million in 2016 inclusive of net derivative settlements received of $88.7 million in 2016 that included a gain of $64.0 million on contracts prior to expiry. The significant fluctuation from period to period is due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedge contracts during these periods.\nExpenses\nLease and plant operating expense increased $14.5 million to $60.9 million, or 31% in 2017 as compared to $46.4 million in 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased production volume and increased compression, salt water disposal, chemicals, repairs and maintenance and fuel and power totaling $12.4 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expense decreased 7% from $7.62 to $7.10 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nMarketing and transportation expense increased $17.7 million to $30.5 million in 2017 as compared to $12.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily in the STACK due to increased throughput at the Kingfisher processing facility beginning in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the increase is due to higher marketing and transportation fee charged to provide effective gathering, efficient processing and assurance that our production will continue to flow as the activity in the basin expands at the Kingfisher processing facility. On a per unit basis, marketing and transportation expense increased from $2.11 to $3.56 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes increased $3.0 million to $7.2 million, or 73%, for 2017, as compared to $4.2 million for 2016. Production taxes increased $3.0 million primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas revenues. Ad valorem taxes\nremained flat year over year. On a per unit basis, the production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.68 to $0.84 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nWorkover expense increased $2.3 million to $5.8 million from $3.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is attributable to many different properties.\nExploration expense includes the costs of our geology department, costs of geological and geophysical data, delay rentals, expired leases, and dry holes. Exploration expense decreased $0.2 million to $24.6 million in 2017 from $24.8 million in 2016. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily due to decreases in lease rental expenses and G&G seismic expenses of $5.3 million, partially offset by an increase in dry hole expense and settlements of our asset retirement obligations in excess of our estimate of $5.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, our property, plant, and equipment balance includes $2.0 million in exploratory well costs which are deferred, pending determination of proved reserves. Such costs will be charged to exploration expense if the wells are ultimately classified as dry holes.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $29.5 million to $94.5 million for 2017 as compared to $65.0 million for 2016. On a per unit basis, this expense increased 3% from $10.67 to $11.02 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively. The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and production by field.\nImpairment expense increased $14.0 million to $30.3 million in 2017 from $16.3 million in 2016. This non-cash expense varies with the results of exploratory and development drilling, as well as with well performance and price declines which may render some projects uneconomic, resulting in impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Impairment\u201d below for more details related to impairment. Certain developed fields were impaired due to downward revisions in reserves based on lower commodity prices, performance, development drilling results that were below expectations or high operating costs. Certain undeveloped leasehold costs were impaired as the Company changed its strategic plans on future development in certain areas. The impairments in 2017 were primarily due to write-downs of both unproved oil and natural gas costs and developed fields, primarily in the non-STACK assets. The impairments in 2016 were primarily due to write-downs in developed fields on non-STACK assets, most notably in the Northwest, East Texas and South Louisiana, totaling $15.4 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $13.8 million to $55.6 million in 2017 from $41.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily due to consulting fees attributable to the business combination of approximately $7.7 million, an increase in information technology consulting fees of $1.2 million and settlement expense of $4.2 million. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% from $6.86 to $6.48 per BOE for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest expense, net decreased $9.4 million to $50.6 million in 2017 from $60.0 million in 2016. The interest on our senior term loan facility decreased $9.2 million as it was repaid in full during the fourth quarter 2016 and interest on our senior secured credit facility decreased $1.0 million due to a decrease in average outstanding balances during the year. In addition, deferred financing costs associated with the senior term loan facility decreased $1.1 million. The decrease was partially offset by the repurchase and redemption of our $450 million aggregate principal amount of 9.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018 by issuing $500 million aggregate principal amount 7.875% senior unsecured notes due 2024, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $2.1 million.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $18.2 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of our $450 million outstanding 2018 Notes for an aggregate cost of $459.4 million, including accrued interest and fees. We recognized a loss related to the repurchase of $13.5 million, which included unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $4.1 million. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility of $127.7 million, which includes accrued interest and a prepayment premium of $2.5 million. We recognized a loss related to the repayment of $4.7 million, which included unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $2.0 million.\nLoss on discontinued operations was $21.4 million in 2017 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $2.3 million in 2016. The increase in the loss on discontinued operations was primarily related to the loss from the sale of assets recognized of $22.2 million.\nResults of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2016 v. Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\n (1) We entered into derivative contracts for natural gas liquids in the fourth quarter of 2015. The derivative contracts for natural gas liquids became effective in 2016. \nRevenues\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $12.3 million, or 9%, to $117.7 million in 2016 from $130.0 million in 2015. The decrease in oil revenue was primarily attributable to lower prices, partially offset by increased production volumes. The average price of oil exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 12% in 2016 resulting in a decrease in oil revenues of approximately $16.5 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 10% from $76.39 per Bbl in 2015 to $68.96 per Bbl in 2016. An increase in production of 91 MBbls, or 3% resulted in an approximate $4.2 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil volumes is primarily by new production from the STACK, which increased 564 MBbls, from 2,006 MBbls in 2015 to 2,570 MBbls in 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreased volume to the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 430 MBbls and natural production decline related to our non-STACK assets.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.1 million, or 12%, to $29.5 million in 2016 from $26.4 million in 2015. The increase in natural gas revenue was attributable to increased production volumes partially offset by lower prices during 2016. An increase in production of 2.9 Bcf, or 28% resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of approximately $7.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in natural gas volumes is attributable to new production from the STACK, which increased 3.9 Bcfe, from 4.3 Bcfe in 2015 to 8.2 Bcfe in 2016. This increase was partially offset by natural production decline related to our non-STACK assets and the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 415 MMcf. The average price of natural gas exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 13% in 2016 resulting in a decrease in natural gas revenues of approximately $4.3 million. The average price inclusive of settlements of derivative contracts decreased 42% from $4.63 per Mcf in 2015 to $2.69 per Mcf in 2016.\nNatural gas liquids revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4.8 million, or 44% to $15.7 million in 2016 from $10.9 million in 2015. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue was primarily attributable to increased volumes as well as an increase in prices. An increase in volumes of 278 MBbls or 41% resulted in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $4.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in natural gas liquid volumes is due primarily to an increase in output in the STACK, which increased 324 MBbls, from 499 MBbls in 2015 to 823 MBbls in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes due to the sale of the remainder of our Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 of 84 MBbls. The average price of natural gas liquids exclusive of settlements of derivative contracts increased 2%, from $16.01 per Bbl in 2015 to $16.38 per Bbl in 2016 resulting in an increase in natural gas liquids revenue of $0.4 million.\nOther revenues were $2.6 million during 2016 as compared to $0.7 million during 2015. Other revenues include salt water disposal fees charged to outside working interest owners. The salt water disposal fees were reclassified from lease operating expense. The fees increased from $0.0 million in 2015 to $2.1 million in 2016.\nGain on sale of assets was a gain of $3.5 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of $67.8 million in 2015. The sale of South Louisiana properties in 2016 resulted in a gain of $3.5 million. The sale of our remaining Eagleville properties in the third quarter of 2015 resulted in a gain of $67.6 million.\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts was a loss of $40.5 million inclusive of derivative settlements received of $88.7 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of $124.1 million inclusive of derivative settlements received of $106.9 million in 2015. The significant fluctuation from period to period is due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedge contracts during these periods.\nExpenses\nLease and plant operating expense decreased $7.4 million to $46.4 million, or 14% in 2016 as compared to $53.8 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salt water disposal, repairs and maintenance, and field services, totaling $6.6 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expense decreased 26% from $10.28 to $7.62 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nMarketing and transportation expense increased $9.7 million to $12.8 million in 2016 as compared to $3.1 million in 2015. The increase is primarily in the STACK due to increased throughput at the Kingfisher processing facility beginning in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the increase is due to higher marketing and transportation fee charged to provide effective gathering, efficient processing and assurance that our production will continue to flow as the activity in the basin expands at the Kingfisher processing facility. On a per unit basis, marketing and transportation expense increased from $0.60 to $2.11 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes decreased $2.1 million to $4.2 million, or 34%, for 2016, as compared to $6.3 million for 2015. Production taxes decreased $1.6 million primarily due to the decrease in oil revenues. Ad valorem taxes decreased $0.5 million. On a per unit basis, the production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $1.20 to $0.68 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nWorkover expense decreased $1.7 million to $3.5 million from $5.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is attributable to many different properties.\nExploration expense includes the costs of our geology department, costs of geological and geophysical data, delay rentals, expired leases, and dry holes. Exploration expense decreased $4.7 million to $24.8 million in 2016 from $29.5 million in 2015. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily due to decreases in dry hole expense and G&G seismic expenses of $11.7 million, partially offset by an increase in expired leasehold and settlements of our asset retirement obligations in excess of our estimates of $7.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, our property, plant, and equipment balance includes $2.1 million in exploratory well costs which are deferred, pending determination of proved reserves. Such costs will be charged to exploration expense if the wells are ultimately classified as dry holes.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $13.0 million to $65.0 million for 2016 as compared to $78.0 million for 2015. On a per unit basis, this expense decreased 28% from $14.89 to $10.67 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and production by field.\nImpairment expense decreased $34.1 million to $16.3 million in 2016 from $50.4 million in 2015. This non-cash expense varies with the results of exploratory and development drilling, as well as with well performance and price declines which may render some projects uneconomic, resulting in impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Impairment\u201d below for more details related to impairment. Certain developed fields were impaired due to downward revisions in reserves based on lower commodity prices, performance or development drilling results that were below expectations. The impairments in 2016 were primarily due to write-downs in developed fields related to our non-STACK assets, totaling $15.4 million. The impairments in 2015 were primarily due to write-downs of both unproved oil and natural gas costs and developed fields, primarily in East Texas, the STACK, and South Louisiana, totaling $34.2 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $2.7 million to $41.8 million in 2016 from $44.5 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower litigation settlement expenses recorded in 2016 as compared to 2015 of $5.3 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries, benefits and deferred compensation of $2.6 million in 2016. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 19% from $8.49 to $6.86 per BOE for 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.8 million to $60.0 million in 2016 from $61.8 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the tender and redemption of the 2018 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2016, which decreased interest costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and senior term loan facility. The senior term loan facility was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense incurred on our borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility increased $1.4 million due to an increase in average outstanding balance. Interest expense incurred on our borrowing under senior secured term loan facility increased $3.0 million as we recognized almost a full year of interest expense and additional amortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million as compared to prior year. We entered into the senior secured term loan facility during the second quarter of 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt was $18.2 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of our $450 million outstanding 2018 Notes for an aggregate cost of $459.4 million, including accrued interest and fees. We recognized a loss related to the repurchase of $13.5 million, which included unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $4.1 million. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility of $127.7 million, which includes accrued interest and a prepayment premium of $2.5 million. We recognized a loss related to the repayment of $4.7 million, which included unamortized deferred financing costs write-offs of $2.0 million.\nLoss on discontinued operations was $2.3 million in 2016 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $157.3 million in 2015. The decreased in the loss on discontinued operations was primarily due to a decrease in impairment expense recognized. Weeks Island field recognized impairment expense of approximately $20,000 during 2016 as compared to $126.3 million during 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal requirements for capital are to fund our day-to-day operations, our exploration and development activities, and to satisfy our contractual obligations, primarily for the payment of debt principal and interest and any amounts owed during the period related to our hedging positions.\nOur 2017 capital budget was primarily focused on the development of our STACK properties through exploitation and development. We spent approximately $369.6 million in 2017 on capital expenditures, including acquisitions, of which $356 million was spent in the STACK. The capital expenditures for 2017 reflected our plans to drill wells that were funded through the joint development agreement with BCE. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we have received approximately $92.7 million from BCE under our joint development agreement. We increased our capital budget for 2018 from 2017 levels in response to the improvement in the current commodity price environment. Our future drilling plans, plans of our drilling operators and capital budgets are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas\nprices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, actions of our operators, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. A deferral of planned capital expenditures, particularly with respect to drilling and completing new wells, could result in a reduction in anticipated production, revenues and cash flows. Additionally, if we curtail our drilling program, we may lose a portion of our acreage through lease expirations. However, because a large percentage of our acreage is held by production, we have the ability to materially increase or decrease our drilling and recompletion budget in response to market conditions with decreased risk of losing significant acreage. In addition, we may be required to reclassify some portion of our reserves currently booked as proved undeveloped reserves to no longer be proved reserves if such a deferral of planned capital expenditures means we will be unable to develop such reserves within five years of their initial booking.\nWe funded our 2017 capital expenditures predominantly with cash flows from operations, drilling and completion of capital funded through our joint development agreement with BCE, capital contribution of $200 million by Riverstone and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending. Subsequent to year end and in connection with the closing of the business combination, Alta Mesa Resources contributed an additional $554 million to us.\nWe expect to fund our capital budget in 2018 and beyond predominantly with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and drilling and completion capital funded through our joint development agreement with BCE. As we execute our business strategy, we will continually monitor the capital resources available to meet future financial obligations and planned capital expenditures. We believe our cash flows provided by operating activities, cash on hand and availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility will provide us with the financial flexibility and wherewithal to meet our cash requirements, including normal operating needs, and pursue our currently planned and future development drilling activities. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties and acquire additional properties. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nSenior Notes\nWe have $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes, or the senior notes\u201d, due December 15, 2024 which were issued at par by us and our wholly owned subsidiary Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp. (collectively, the Issuers\u201d) during the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2017. At any time prior to December 15, 2019, we may, from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes in an amount of cash not greater than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price of 107.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 120 days of the closing date of such equity offering. At any time prior to December 15, 2019, we may, on any one or more occasions, redeem all or part of the senior notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of change of control, each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. On and after December 15, 2019, we may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 105.906% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2019, 103.938% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2020, 101.969% for the twelve-month period beginning on December 15, 2021 and 100.000% beginning on December 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\nSubsequent to year end, the closing of the business combination with Alta Mesa Resources did not constitute as a change of control under the indenture governing the senior notes because certain existing owners of the Company and SRII Opco LP entered into the Voting Agreement with respect to the voting interests in AMH GP. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nThe senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our material subsidiaries, subject to certain customary release provisions. Accordingly, they will rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness; senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the senior notes or the respective guarantees; effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and obligations of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes.\nThe senior notes contain certain covenants limiting the Issuers' ability and the ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to, under certain circumstances, prepay subordinated indebtedness, pay distributions, redeem stock or make certain restricted investments; incur indebtedness; create liens on the Issuers' assets to secure debt; restrict dividends, distributions or other payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of restricted subsidiaries; effect a consolidation or merger; and change our line of business.\nThe indenture contains customary events of default, including:\n \ufeff \uf0b7 default in any payment of interest on the senior notes when due, continued for 30 days; \ufeff \uf0b7 default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the senior notes when due; \n \ufeff \uf0b7 failure by the Issuers or any subsidiary guarantor to comply with its obligations under the indenture; \ufeff \uf0b7 default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuers or restricted subsidiaries; \n \ufeff \uf0b7 certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuers or restricted subsidiaries; and \ufeff \uf0b7 failure by the Issuers or certain subsidiaries that would constitute a payment of final judgment aggregating in excess of $20.0 million. \nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 9, 2018, we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility is for an aggregate of $1.0 billion with an initial $350.0 million borrowing base limit. The Eighth A&R credit facility does not permit us to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing we are not in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants.\n\ufeff\nAs of March 29, 2018, we have no outstanding borrowings under the Eighth A&R and have $13.6 million of outstanding letters of credit reimbursement obligations.\nThe principal amounts borrowed are payable on the maturity date on February 9, 2023. We have a choice of borrowing in Eurodollars or at the reference rate, with such borrowings bearing interest, payable quarterly for reference rate loans and one month, three month or six month periods for Eurodollar loans. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate at the LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%. Reference rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank's reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. The next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is on April 1, 2018. The borrowing base may be reduced in connection with the next redetermination of its borrowing base. The amounts outstanding under the Eighth A&R credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Company's and its material operating subsidiaries' oil and natural gas properties and associated assets and all of the stock of our material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Eighth A&R credit facility. Additionally, SRII Opco, LP and AMH GP have pledged their respective limited partner interests in us as security for our obligations. If an event of default occurs under the Eighth A&R credit facility, the administrative agent will have the right to proceed against the pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets and our material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors.\nThe Eighth A&R credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, guaranty or make loans to others, make investments, enter into mergers, make certain payments and distributions, enter into or be party to hedge agreements, amend our organizational documents, incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. The Eighth A&R credit facility permits us to make distributions to any parent entity (i) to pay for reimbursement of third party costs and expenses that are general and administrative expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business by such parent entity or (ii) in order to permit such parent entity to (x) make permitted tax distributions and (y) pay the obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below).\nThe Eighth A&R credit facility also requires us to maintain the following two financial ratios:\n urirur \u2022 a current ratio, tested quarterly, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, of our consolidated current assets to our consolidated current liabilities of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter; and \n\ufeff\n \ufeff \u2022 a leverage ratio, tested quarterly, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, of our consolidated debt (other than obligations under hedge agreements) as of the end of such fiscal quarter to its consolidated EBITDAX annualized by multiplying EBITDAX for the period of (A) the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018 times 4, (B) the two fiscal quarter periods ending September 30, 2018 times 2 and (C) the three fiscal quarter periods ending December 31, 2018 times 4/3rds and (D) for each fiscal quarter on or after March 31, 2019, EBITDAX times 4/4, of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nOperating activities (including operating activities from discontinued operations) provided cash of $59.3 million in 2017, as compared to $131.7 million in 2016. Of the $59.3 million and $131.7 million cash provided by operating activities in 2017 and 2016, discontinued operations provided cash of approximately $21.2 million and 27.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $72.4 million decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to various factors. Cash-based items of net income, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $8.4 million in earnings and a negative impact on cash flow. The changes in our working capital accounts used $64.0 million in cash as compared to having provided $23.8 million in cash in 2016.\nOperating activities (including operating activities from discontinued operations) provided cash of $131.7 million in 2016, as compared to $144.0 million in 2015. The $12.3 million decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to various factors. Cash-based items of net income, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $36.1 million in earnings and a negative impact on cash flow. The changes in our working capital accounts provided $23.8 million in cash as compared to having provided $4.5 million in cash in 2015.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities (including investing activities from discontinued operations) used cash of $345.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for property and equipment, including acquisitions used cash of $369.6 million and $225.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we entered into an interest bearing promissory note receivable with our affiliate Northwest Gas Processing, LLC for approximately $1.5 million in 2017. The cash used for investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Weeks Island field and other assets of approximately $25.2 million.\nInvesting activities (including investing activities from discontinued operations) used cash of $224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to proceeds from the sale of property in 2015 of approximately $141.4 million. The increase in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by decreased expenditures for drilling and development and decreased acquisitions in 2016.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $283.9 million during 2017 as compared to cash provided of $91.2 million during 2016, an increase of $192.7 million. During 2017, we drew down $76.4 million, net of payments, under our senior secured revolving credit facility and we paid $0.4 million of deferred financing costs related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and senior notes. During 2017, Riverstone was admitted as a limited partner in connection with its $200 million contribution to us. In addition, we received $7.9 million in capital contributions from our former Class B limited partner, High Mesa.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $91.2 million during 2016 as compared to cash used of $30.6 million during 2015, an increase of $121.8 million. During 2016, we used proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes of $500.0 million, capital contributions from our Class B limited partner of $303.5 million and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility of $222.6 million to repay $459.4 million on the 2018 Notes, repay $127.7 million on our senior secured term loan facility and pay down $333.9 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility. In addition, we incurred $13.7 million of deferred financing costs.\nRisk Management Activities - Commodity Derivative Instruments\nDue to the risk of low oil and natural gas prices, we periodically enter into price-risk management transactions (e.g., swaps, collars, puts, calls, and financial basis swap contracts) for a portion of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production. In certain cases, this allows us to achieve a more predictable cash flow, as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations. The commodity derivative instruments apply to only a portion of our production, and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices, and may partially limit our potential gains from future increases in prices. At December 31, 2017, commodity derivative instruments were in place covering approximately 69% of our projected oil production and, approximately 1% of our natural gas production from proved developed properties for 2018. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017, Derivative Financial Instruments,\u201d for further information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\ufeff\n\n (1) Interest includes interest on the outstanding balance under our senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2020, payable quarterly; on the 2024 Notes, payable semiannually; and on the debt to our founder, which is payable with principal, at maturity in 2021. The weighted average rate on our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017 of 5.48% was utilized to calculate the projected interest for our senior secured revolving credit facility. Projected obligation amounts are based on the payment schedules for interest, and are not presented on an accrual basis. On February 9, 2018, and in connection with the closing of the business combination (as described in Note 19 - Subsequent Events), we entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent (the Eighth A&R credit facility\u201d). The Eighth A&R credit facility extended our maturity date from November 2020 to February 2023. As of February 9, 2018, all outstanding balances under our credit facility were paid in full. In addition, our founder converted the founder notes into equity interests in the AM Contributor immediately prior to the closing of the business combination with AMR. \n (2) The drilling rigs are included at the gross contractual value. Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation. Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed. The drillings rigs are utilized in drilling wells that may or may not be included as part of our joint development agreement with BCE. \n (3) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017 we had no guarantees of third-party obligations. Our off-balance sheet obligations include the obligations under operating leases, and the $2.2 million contingent properties payment for properties acquired in 2008 and prior years. We also have bonds posted in the aggregate amount of $17.4 million, primarily to cover future abandonment costs, and $13.6 million in letters of credit provided under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We typically enter into short-term drilling contracts which are customary in the oil and gas industry. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe have no plans to enter into any additional off-balance sheet arrangements in the foreseeable future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). As used herein, the following acronyms have the following meanings: FASB\u201d means the Financial Accounting Standards Board; the Codification\u201d refers to the Accounting Standards Codification, the collected accounting and reporting guidance maintained by the FASB; ASC\u201d means Accounting Standards Codification and is generally followed by a number indicating a particular section of the Codification; and ASU\u201d means Accounting Standards Update, followed by an identification number, which are the periodic updates made to the Codification by the FASB.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.\nEmerging growth company. We are classified as an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among\nother things: (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues at the end of any fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates measured as of June 30, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\ufeff\nReserve estimates significantly impact depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and impairments of oil and natural gas properties and are subject to change based on changes in oil and natural gas prices and trends and changes in estimated reserve quantities. Other significant estimates include those related to oil and natural gas reserves, the value of oil and natural gas properties (including acquisition properties), oil and natural gas revenues, bad debts, asset retirement obligations, derivative contracts, state taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review estimates and underlying assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nProperty and Equipment. Oil and natural gas producing activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under the successful efforts method, lease acquisition costs and all development costs, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\nUnproved Properties - Acquisition costs associated with the acquisition of leases are recorded as unproved properties and capitalized as incurred. These consist of costs incurred in obtaining a mineral interest or right in a property, such as a lease in addition to options to lease, broker fees, recording fees and other similar costs related to activities in acquiring properties. Unproved properties are classified as unproved until proved reserves are discovered, at which time related costs are transferred to proved oil and natural gas properties.\nExploration Expense - Exploration expenses, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense as incurred. These expenses include seismic expenditures and other geological and geophysical costs, expired leases, and lease rentals. The costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic wells are initially capitalized pending determination of whether the well has discovered proved commercial reserves. If the exploratory well is determined to be unsuccessful, the cost of the well is transferred to expense. Exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Properties - Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering, and storing oil and natural gas are capitalized. All costs incurred to drill and equip successful exploratory wells, development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\nImpairment - The capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed at least quarterly for impairment following the guidance provided in ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Subsequent Measurement, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value and is not recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on comparing the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows at a producing field level to the carrying value of the assets. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on estimates of anticipated production from proved reserves and future crude oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, are lower than the carrying cost, the carrying cost of the asset or group of assets is reduced to fair value. For our proved oil and natural gas properties, we estimate fair value by discounting the projected future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.\nUnproved properties are assessed at least annually to determine whether they have been impaired. Individually significant properties are assessed for impairment on a property-by-property basis, while individually insignificant unproved leasehold costs may be assessed in the aggregate. If unproved leasehold costs are found to be impaired, an impairment allowance is provided and a loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization - Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) of capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method based upon estimated proved reserves. Assets are grouped for DD&A on the basis of reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. The reserve base used to calculate DD&A for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to\ncalculate DD&A for lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, includes only proved developed reserves.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues when products are delivered at a fixed or determinable price, title has transferred and collectability is reasonably assured. We use the sales method of accounting for recognition of natural gas imbalances.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. We use derivative contracts to hedge the effects of fluctuations in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We account for such derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d which establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and requires them to be measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 6 for information on fair value).\nUnder ASC 815, hedge accounting is used to defer recognition of unrealized changes in the fair value of such financial instruments, for those contracts which qualify as fair value or cash flow hedges, as defined in the guidance. Historically, we have not designated any of our derivative contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the contracts are included in earnings as Gain (loss) on derivative contracts.\u201d Cash flows from settlements of derivative contracts are classified as operating cash flows.\nIncome Taxes. We have elected under the Internal Revenue Code provisions to be treated as individual partnerships for tax purposes. Accordingly, items of income, expense, gains and losses flow through to the partners and are taxed at the partner level. Accordingly, no tax provision for federal operations taxes is included in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to the Texas margin tax, which is considered a state income tax, and is included in Provision for state income tax\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations. We record state income tax (current and deferred) based on taxable income as defined under the rules for the margin tax.\nAcquisitions. Acquisitions are accounted for as purchases using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the closing date of the acquisitions. Purchase prices are allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair value at the time of the acquisition.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We estimate the present value of future costs of dismantlement and abandonment of our wells, facilities, and other tangible, long-lived assets, recording them as liabilities in the period incurred. We follow ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. ASC 410 requires that an asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred or becomes determinable (as defined by the standard), with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash outflows for abandonment discounted generally at our cost of capital at the time of recognition.\nInvestments. Our investment consists of a 10.17% ownership interest in a drilling company, Orion Drilling Company, LLC ( Orion\u201d). The investment is accounted for under the cost method and we have recorded $9.0 million of Investment in LLC on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Under this method, our share of earnings or losses of the investment are not included in the consolidated statements of operations. Distributions from Orion are recognized in current period earnings as declared.\nPrior to the Closing, Alta Mesa was a part owner of AEM with an ownership interest of less than 10%. AEM markets our oil and natural gas and sells it under short-term contracts generally with month-to-month pricing based on published regional indices, with differentials for transportation, location, and quality taken into account. AEM remits monthly collections of these sales to us, and receives a 1% marketing fee.\nDeferred Financing Costs. The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing. These costs are amortized over the term of the related financing using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The amortization expense is recorded as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which seeks to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers concerning the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from those contracts. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued various clarifications and interpretive guidance to assist entities with implementation efforts, including guidance pertaining to the presentation of revenues on a gross basis (revenues presented separately from associated expenses) versus a net basis.\nASU 2014-09 and related interpretive guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, except for emerging growth companies that elect to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards pursuant to Section 7(a)(2)(b) of the Securities Act. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as necessary. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\ufeff\nWe are in the process of assessing our contracts and evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as it relates to certain sales contracts, and in particular, as it relates to disclosure requirements. In addition, we are evaluating the impact, if any, on the presentation of our future revenues and expenses under the new gross-versus-net presentation guidance. We continue to evaluate the impact of these and other provisions of ASU 2014-09 on our accounting policies, changes to relevant business practices, internal controls, and consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which supersedes ASC 840 Leases\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 842 Leases.\u201d The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents a lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 also requires disclosures designed to provide information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land easement practical expedient for transition to Topic 842 ( ASU 2018-01\u201d), which provides an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounting for as leases under Topic 840, Leases. The standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for all other entities, with earlier adoption permitted. In the normal course of business, we enter into operating lease agreements to support our exploration and development operations and lease assets such as drilling rigs, well equipment, compressors, office space and other assets.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial statements; however, the adoption and impletion of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in an increase in both the assets and liabilities relating to our operating lease activities greater than twelve months. The adoption is also expected to result in increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and interest expense and a reduction in rent expense recorded on our consolidated statement of operations, and additional disclosures. As part of our assessment to date, we have formed an implementation work team and will complete our evaluation in 2018. As we continue to evaluate and implement the standard, we plan to provide additional information about the expected financial impact at a future date. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during 2020. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard on January 1, 2019.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for all other entities. As an emerging growth company we have elected to use the extended transition period and as a result, we will be required to adopt the standard during 2019. AMR is also an emerging growth company. It is reasonably possible that AMR could cease to be an emerging growth company by December 31, 2018. We intend to apply push down accounting and reflect AMR's basis and accounting policies in our financial statements from the date of the business combination. Therefore, we could be required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance will not impact our financial position or results of operations but could result in presentation changes on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents on the statements of cash flows and to provide a reconciliation of the totals in that statement to the related captions in the balance sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2018 for private companies, and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2016-18 in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies for further details.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2017 for public companies and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for all other entities. The amendments should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date and disclosures are not required at transition. Early adoption is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-01 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however these amendments could result in the recording of fewer business combinations in the future periods.", "item_7_tables": "Table 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

driven by higher oil, natural gas, and NGL prices as well as increased production volumes.\n\n- The company has transitioned its focus from conventional assets to developing its oil and liquids-rich STACK play. STACK production accounted for most of the company's production growth in 2017. \n\n- Capital expenditures increased in 2017 as Alta Mesa focused investment on STACK drilling. The company plans to further increase its 2018 capital budget for STACK development.\n\n- Alta Mesa took on additional debt in 2016-2017, including a $500 million senior unsecured note issuance, to fund STACK investments. The company repaid other debt facilities during this period.  \n\n- In February 2018, Alta Mesa completed a major business combination with Alta Mesa Resources, a publicly traded company, which provided a $554 million cash infusion. This positioned the combined company for further STACK investments.\n\n- The MD&A explains the company's key accounting policies and significant estimates made regarding reserves, impairment, revenue recognition, derivatives, and asset retirement obligations.\n\nIn summary, the report highlights Alta Mesa's strategic shift towards the STACK play, financed by debt and equity funding, which drove strong production and revenue growth in 2017.
