MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see Defined Terms\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCompared with the prior year, the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect lower earnings from operations before income tax of $29.4 million, or 17%, primarily due to factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a net decrease in the volume of retail kWh sold mostly due to milder weather and lower demand due to the impact of COVID-19; and\n\u2022a reduction in revenues due to an accrued regulatory liability for excess earnings under the FAC provisions.\nThese were partially offset by:\n\u2022a decrease in maintenance expenses; and\n\u2022lower pension costs.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion.\nOVERVIEW OF 2020 RESULTS AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE\nThe most important matters on which we focus in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and allocating our resources include: (i) recurring factors which have significant impacts on operating performance such as: regulatory action, environmental matters, weather and weather-related damage in our service area, customer growth and the local economy; (ii) our progress on performance improvement and growth strategies designed to maintain high standards in several operating areas (including safety, customer satisfaction, operations, financial and enterprise-wide performance, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility) simultaneously; and (iii) our short-term and long-term financial and operating strategies. For a discussion of how we are impacted by regulation and environmental matters, please see Note 2, Regulatory Matters\u201d to the Financial Statements and Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOperational Excellence\nOur objective is to optimize IPL's performance in the U.S. utility industry by focusing on the following areas: safety, operations (reliability and customer satisfaction), financial and enterprise-wide performance (efficiency and cost savings, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility). We set and measure these objectives carefully, balancing them in a way and to a degree necessary to ensure a sustainable high level of performance in these areas simultaneously as compared to our peers. We monitor our performance in these areas, and where practical and meaningful, compare performance in some areas to peer utilities. Because some of our financial and enterprise-wide performance measures are company-specific performance goals, they are not benchmarked.\nOur safety performance is measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury near misses. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.\nIPL measures delivery reliability by Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\"CAIDI\"), System Average Interruption Duration Index (\"SAIDI\") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\"SAIFI\") and benchmarks the reliability metrics against other utilities at both the state and national levels. IPL also measures customer centricity on more of an individual basis by the industry metric of Customers that Experience Multiple Interruption of five or more times (\"CEMI-5\"). IPL measures generation reliability by Commercial Availability ( CA\u201d), Equivalent Forced Outage Factor ( EFOF\u201d) and Equivalent Availability Factor ( EAF\u201d) metrics and benchmarks both EFOF and EAF results nationally. We measure Customer Satisfaction using J.D. Power in their Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study and Research America Market Research - Consumer Insight. Monitoring performance in the areas such as competitive rates, operational reliability and customer service supports our ongoing work to deliver reliable service to our customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following review of consolidated results of operations and \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" sections compare the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019. For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2018, see Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nIn addition to the discussion on operations below, please see the Statistical Information on Operations\u201d table included in Item 1. Business\u201d of this report for additional data such as kWh sales and number of customers by customer class.\nStatements of Operations Highlights\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degree days for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degree days in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\nRetail Revenues\nThe decrease in retail revenues of $105.3 million was primarily due to the following (in millions):\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in the volume of kWh sold, primarily due to milder weather in our service territory versus the comparable period and lower demand resulting from impacts of COVID-19 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in the weighted average price of retail kWh sold, primarily due to lower fuel revenues, including a $10.0 million reduction due to excess earnings under FAC provisions (see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\" to the Financial Statements for more information), partially offset by favorable block rate(1) and other retail rate variances\n</td> <td>(40.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other: </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in retail revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Block rate variances are primarily attributable to our declining block rate structure, which generally provides for residential and commercial customers to be charged a higher per kWh rate at lower consumption levels. Therefore, as volumes decrease, the weighted average price per kWh increases and vice versa.\nWholesale Revenues\nThe decrease in wholesale revenues of $22.0 million was primarily due to a $21.5 million volume decrease and a $0.5 million decrease in the weighted average price per kWh sold. We sold 1,866.0 million kWh in the wholesale market during 2020 compared to 2,718.4 million kWh during 2019 primarily due to lower demand and lower unit availability (mostly attributed to the timing of outages). Our ability to be dispatched in the MISO market is primarily driven by the locational marginal price of electricity and variable generation costs. The amount of electricity available for wholesale sales is impacted by our retail load requirements, generation capacity and unit availability.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nThe following table illustrates changes in Operating costs and expenses from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,105 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,466 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(93,361) </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased </td> <td>135,767 </td> <td> </td> <td>133,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,093 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance </td> <td>416,169 </td> <td> </td> <td>428,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,032) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>246,896 </td> <td> </td> <td>240,314 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,582 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income taxes </td> <td>44,516 </td> <td> </td> <td>42,236 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,280 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total operating costs and expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,090,453 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,184,891 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(94,438) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuel\nThe decrease in fuel costs of $93.4 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022a $38.0 million decrease due to the lower price of natural gas consumed versus the comparable period;\n\u2022a $34.4 million decrease in the quantity of fuel consumed versus the comparable period;\n\u2022an $11.6 million decrease from deferred fuel costs; and\n\u2022an $8.9 million decrease due to the lower price of coal consumed versus the comparable period.\nWe are generally permitted to recover underestimated fuel and purchased power costs to serve our retail customers in future rates through quarterly FAC proceedings. These variances are deferred when incurred and amortized into expense in the same period that our rates are adjusted to reflect these variances. For further discussion, please see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Additionally, fuel and purchased power costs incurred for wholesale energy sales are considered in the Off System Sales Margin rider.\nPower Purchased\nThe increase in purchased power costs of $2.1 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022a $48.6 million increase due to a 45% increase in the volume of power purchased during the period; partially offset by\n\u2022a $46.7 million decrease in the market price of purchased power.\nThe volume of power purchased each period is primarily influenced by retail demand, generating unit capacity and outages, and the relative cost of producing power versus purchasing power in the market. The primary driver for the $48.6 million volume increase was due to IPL's generation units running less frequently during 2020 due to lower market prices of purchased power, as well as the timing and duration of outages during these respective periods. The market price of purchased power is influenced primarily by changes in the market price of delivered fuel (primarily natural gas), the supply of and demand for electricity, and the time of day during which power is purchased.\nOperation and Maintenance\nThe decrease in Operation and maintenance expense of $12.0 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022decreased maintenance expenses of $13.7 million primarily due to decreased outage costs; and\n\u2022a $6.2 million write-off of materials and supplies inventory recorded in December 2019 (for further discussion, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filing\u201d).\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022increase in MISO non-purchased power costs (primarily transmission related expenses) of $4.3 million; and\n\u2022higher DSM program costs of $3.2 million (these program costs are recoverable through customer rates and are offset by an increase in DSM revenues).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in Depreciation and amortization expense of $6.6 million was mostly attributed to the impact of additional assets placed in service.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\nThe increase in Taxes other than income taxes of $2.3 million was mostly attributed to higher property taxes of $1.9 million primarily as a result of higher assessed values.\nOther Income / (Expense), Net\nThe following table illustrates changes in Other income / (expense), net from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income/(expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for equity funds used during construction </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,574 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,486 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,088 </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(129,493) </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,771) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,722) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt </td> <td>(2,424) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,424) </td> <td> </td> <td>#DIV/0! </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income / (expense), net </td> <td>3,370 </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,546) </td> <td> </td> <td>13,916 </td> <td> </td> <td>(132.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total other income/(expense), net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(123,973) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(128,831) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,858 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in Interest expense of $7.7 million was primarily due to (i) amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate hedges of $5.4 million beginning in April 2020 and (ii) higher interest expense on long-term debt of $3.0 million mostly due to higher rates.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThe increase in Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt of $2.4 million was primarily due to a make-whole premium and write-off of deferred financing costs due to the redemption of $405 million of 2020 IPALCO Notes and $65 million IPALCO Term Loan in the second quarter of 2020.\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe increase in Other income/(expense), net of $13.9 million was primarily due to a decrease in defined benefit plan costs of $16.1 million due to a higher expected return on plan assets compared to the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table illustrates changes in income tax expense from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,592 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,528 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,936) </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in income tax expense of $6.9 million was primarily due to lower pretax income versus the comparable period.\nKEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring 2021 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition, our financial results will likely be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n\u25aathe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulation; and\n\u25aatimely recovery of capital expenditures.\nIf favorable outcomes related to these factors do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this report impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, then these factors, or other factors unknown to us, may impact our operating margin, net income and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For a discussion of the risks related to our business, see Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor of Indiana also issued an Executive Order prohibiting electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers through August 14, 2020, which prohibition has lapsed.\nIn addition to the impacts to demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, and such expenses may include those that relate to events outside of our control. We experienced impacts from the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021 and expect to continue to experience impacts for the remainder of 2021, and any such impacts during that time or in other future periods could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook based on information known as of this filing.

Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Continuity - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure our ability to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electric energy, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities and to provide essential services to the communities in which we operate. We continue to respond to this global crisis through comprehensive measures to protect our employees and others while fulfilling our vital role in providing our customers with electric energy. While stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted in our service territory, most of our management and administrative personnel are able to work remotely, and we have not experienced significant issues affecting our operations or ability to maintain effective internal controls and produce reliable financial information.\nDemand - The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to materialize in Indiana in the second half of March 2020 and continued for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. See Note 15, \"Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19 Pandemic\" for further discussion of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our sales demand and Note 13, \"Revenue\" to the Financial Statements for a disaggregation of retail revenues by customer class. The declines for small and large commercial and industrial customers were most severe in April and May, and partially\nrecovered the remainder of the year as stay-at-home orders were lifted. While we cannot predict the length and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic or how it could ultimately impact global or local economic conditions, continuous and/or further declines in future demand would adversely impact our financial results for 2021 and beyond.\nLiquidity - We anticipate continuing to have sufficient liquidity to make all required payments, including payments for salaries and wages owed to our employees, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also continue to not foresee a significant impact to our access to capital or our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020, IPALCO accessed the capital markets to issue $475 million in principal amount of 4.25%, ten-year notes, which has been used to repay IPALCO debt due to mature in 2020. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020 IPL issued $90 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds and used the proceeds to refund $90 million of Indiana Finance Authority Environmental Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 2015A&B. For further discussion of our financial condition, liquidity, and capital requirements, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\" of this Form 10-K.\nCredit Exposures - We continue to monitor and manage our credit exposures in a prudent manner. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and into 2021, we experienced credit-related impacts from utility customers due to the prohibition of electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers and due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in an increase in past due customer receivable balances, and our allowance for credit losses has increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Accounts Receivable\" for further discussion of our allowance for credit losses. If these credit-related impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue into 2021 or beyond, further deterioration in our credit exposures and customer collections may result. See Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters\" for a discussion of regulatory measures which mitigate this impact.\nSupply Chain - Our supply chain management has remained robust during this challenging time and we continue to closely manage and monitor developments.\nCapital Projects - During the COVID-19 pandemic, our construction projects are proceeding without material delays. For further discussion of our capital requirements, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\" of this Form 10-K.\nCARES Act - The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. While we currently expect a limited impact from this legislation on our business, we have deferred the payment of federal payroll taxes in accordance with the provisions of this act. At December 31, 2020, the total deferral was approximately $2.5 million.\nSee Note 15, \"Risks and Uncertainties\" to the Financial Statements and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperational\nAs part of IPL's December 2019 Integrated Resource Plan filing, IPL has plans to retire 630 MW of coal-fired generation at Petersburg Units 1 and 2. IPL issued an all-source request for proposal to competitively procure replacement capacity by June 1, 2023, which is the first year IPL is expected to have a capacity shortfall. Proposals were received through February 28, 2020 and are currently being evaluated. On February 5, 2021, IPL announced an agreement to acquire a 195 MW solar project, subject to approval from the IURC. For further discussion, see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - IRP Filing\" of this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Environment\nFor a discussion of the regulatory environment related to our business, see Item 1. Business - Regulation\u201d and Note 2, Regulatory Matters\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Political\nReference Rate Reform\nIn July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Association (\"IBA\") announced it had begun consultation on its intention to cease publication of two specific LIBOR rates by December 31, 2021, while extending the timeline for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. The IBA expects to make separate announcements in this regard following the outcome of the consultation. We maintain financial instruments that use LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark. Although the full impact of the reform remains unknown, we have begun to engage with our counterparties to discuss specific action items to be undertaken in order to prepare for amendments when they become due.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $20.5 million and available borrowing capacity of $175 million under our unsecured revolving Credit Agreement. All of IPL's long-term borrowings must first be approved by the IURC and the aggregate amount of IPL's short-term indebtedness must be approved by the FERC. We have approval from the FERC to borrow up to $500 million of short-term indebtedness outstanding at any time through July 26, 2022. In December 2018, we received an order from the IURC granting us authority through December 31, 2021 to, among other things, issue up to $350 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, all of which authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020, and refinance up to $185 million in existing indebtedness, of which $95 million of authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. This order also grants us authority to have up to $500 million of long-term credit agreements and liquidity facilities outstanding at any one time, of which $250 million remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. As an alternative to the sale of all or a portion of $65 million in principal of the long-term debt, we have the authority to issue up to $65 million of new preferred stock, all of which authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. We also have restrictions on the amount of new debt that may be issued due to contractual obligations of AES and by financial covenant restrictions under our existing debt obligations. We do not believe such restrictions will be a limiting factor in our ability to issue debt in the ordinary course of prudent business operations.\nWe believe that existing cash balances, cash generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity on our committed Credit Agreement will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet anticipated operating expenses, interest expense on outstanding indebtedness, recurring capital expenditures and to pay dividends to AES U.S. Investments and CDPQ. Sources for principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and nonrecurring capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from: (i) existing cash balances; (ii) cash generated from operating activities; (iii) borrowing capacity on our committed Credit Agreement; (iv) additional debt financing; and (v) equity capital contributions. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes such repurchases are favorable to make. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.\nIPL First Mortgage Bonds\nIn December 2020, the Indiana Finance Authority issued on behalf of IPL an aggregate principal amount of $90 million of Environmental Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2020A&B due December 2038. For further discussion, please see Note 7, \" Debt - IPL First Mortgage Bonds.\"\nIPL has $95 million of 3.875% IPL first mortgage bonds that are due August 1, 2021. For further discussion, please see Note 7, Debt - IPL First Mortgage Bonds.\u201d\nIPALCO's Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan\nIn April 2020, IPALCO completed the sale of the $475 million 2030 IPALCO Notes priced at 4.25%, with the net proceeds from this offering used to retire the Term Loan on April 14, 2020. The remaining net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the 2020 IPALCO Notes on May 14, 2020, and to pay certain related fees,\nexpenses and make-whole premiums. For further discussion, please see Note 7, Debt - IPALCO's Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan.\u201d\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td>

Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional details on each of these projects.\nCapital Resources\nAs IPALCO is a holding company, substantially all of its cash is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries, principally IPL. None of its subsidiaries, including IPL, are obligated under or have guaranteed to make payments with respect to the 2024 IPALCO Notes or the 2030 IPALCO Notes; however, all of IPL's common stock is pledged to secure these debt obligations. Accordingly, IPALCO's ability to make payments on the 2024 IPALCO Notes and the 2030 IPALCO Notes depends on the ability of IPL to generate cash and distribute it to IPALCO.\nLiquidity\nWe expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, potential margin requirements related to interest rate and commodity hedges, taxes and dividend payments. For 2021 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations, funds from debt financing, and funds from equity capital contributions as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods. The absence of adequate liquidity could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIndebtedness\nSignificant Debt Transactions\nFor further discussion of our significant debt transactions, please see Note 7, Debt\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nLine of Credit\nIPL entered into an amendment and restatement of its 5-year $250 million revolving credit facility on June 19, 2019 with a syndication of bank lenders, as discussed in Note 7, Debt - Line of Credit\u201d to the Financial Statements. This Credit Agreement is an unsecured committed line of credit to be used: (i) to finance capital expenditures; (ii) to refinance certain existing indebtedness, (iii) to support working capital; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nWe had the following amounts available under the revolving Credit Agreement:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Commitment </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts available at December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Ratings\nOur ability to borrow money or to refinance existing indebtedness and the interest rates at which we can borrow money or refinance existing indebtedness are affected by our credit ratings. In addition, the applicable interest rates on IPL's Credit Agreement (as well as the amount of certain other fees in the Credit Agreement) are dependent\nupon the credit ratings of IPL. Downgrades in the credit ratings of AES could result in IPL's and/or IPALCO's credit ratings being downgraded. Any reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities.\nThe following table presents the debt ratings and credit ratings (issuer/corporate rating) and outlook for IPALCO and IPL, along with the dates each rating was effective or affirmed.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>IPALCO </td> <td> </td> <td>IPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective or Affirmed </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa3 (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A2 (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P Global Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A- (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>IPALCO </td> <td> </td> <td>IPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective or Affirmed </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P Global Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Ratings relate to IPALCO's Senior Secured Notes.\n(b)Ratings relate to IPL's Senior Secured Bonds.\nWe cannot predict whether our current debt and credit ratings or the debt and credit ratings of IPL will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nOur non-contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are set forth below:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment due </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term and long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,758.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,143.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>1,930.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,366.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal, gas, purchased power and </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> related transportation </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>188.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,060.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,040.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term and long-term debt:\nOur short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2020 consists of outstanding borrowings on the committed line of credit, IPL first mortgage bonds and IPALCO long-term debt. These long-term debt amounts include current maturities but exclude unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing costs. See Note 7, \"Debt\" to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nInterest obligations:\nInterest payment obligations are associated with the short-term and long-term debt described above. The interest payments relating to variable-rate debt are projected using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020.\nPurchase obligations:\nPurchase commitments for coal, gas, purchased power and related transportation:\nIPL enters into long-term contracts for the purchase of coal, gas, purchased power and related transportation. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances.\nPurchase orders and other contractual obligations:\nAt December 31, 2020, we had various other contractual obligations including contracts to purchase goods and services with various terms and expiration dates. Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and payment of future obligations to the Service Company, and our ability to terminate such obligations upon 90 days' notice, we have excluded such amounts in the contractual obligations table above. This table also does not include (i) regulatory liabilities (see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters\"), (ii) derivatives and incentive compensation (see Note 5, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"), (iii) taxes (see Note 8, \"Income Taxes\"), (iv) pension and other postretirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 9, \"Benefit Plans\") and (v) contingencies (see Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"). See the indicated notes to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded.\nReserve for uncertain tax positions:\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $7.4 million at December 31, 2020, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included such amounts in the contractual obligations table above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period presented. Therefore, the possibility exists for materially different reported amounts under different conditions or assumptions. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements. This section addresses only those accounting policies involving amounts material to our financial statements that require the most estimation, judgment or assumptions and should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues related to the sale of energy are generally recognized when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is accrued. In making our estimates of unbilled revenue, we use complex models that consider various factors including daily generation volumes; known amounts of energy usage by nearly all residential, small commercial and industrial customers; estimated line losses; and estimated customer rates based on prior period billings. Given the use of these models, and that customers are billed on a monthly cycle, we believe it is unlikely that materially different results will occur in future periods when revenue is billed. The effect on 2020 revenues and ending unbilled revenues of a one percentage point change in estimated line losses for the month of December 2020 is immaterial. An allowance for potential credit losses is maintained and amounts are written off when normal collection efforts have been exhausted.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcome of tax examinations when determining the adequacy of our income tax provisions by considering the technical merits of the filing position, case law, and\nresults of previous tax examinations. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of our income tax positions. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While we believe that the amount of the tax reserves is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nRegulation\nAs a regulated utility, we apply the provisions of ASC 980 Regulated Operations,\u201d which gives recognition to the ratemaking and accounting practices of the IURC and the FERC. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds or future rate reductions to customers for previous overcollections or the deferral of revenues collected for costs that IPL expects to incur in the future. Specific regulatory assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 2, Regulatory Matters - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\u201d to the Financial Statements.\nThe deferral of costs (as regulatory assets) is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable. In assessing probability, we consider such factors as specific orders from the IURC, regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment. To the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed probable, related regulatory assets would be required to be expensed in current period earnings. Our regulatory assets and liabilities have been created pursuant to specific orders of the IURC or established regulatory practices, such as other utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC being granted recovery of similar costs. It is probable, but not certain, that these regulatory assets will be recoverable, subject to IURC approval.\nAROs\nIn accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for AROs, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are required to be recognized at their fair value at the time those obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a legal liability, costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. These GAAP provisions also require that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon future retirement, whether legal AROs or not, must be removed from a company's accumulated depreciation reserve and be reclassified as a regulatory liability. We make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses as they relate to AROs. These assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time. See Note 3, \"Property, Plant and Equipment - ARO\" to the Financial Statements for more information.\nPension Costs\nWe account for and disclose pension and postemployment benefits in accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for pension and other postemployment plans. These GAAP provisions require the use of assumptions, such as the discount rate for liabilities and long-term rate of return on assets, in determining the obligations, annual cost and funding requirements of the plans.\nContingencies\nWe accrue for loss contingencies when the amount of the loss is probable and estimable. We are subject to various environmental regulations and are involved in certain legal proceedings. If our actual environmental and/or legal obligations are different from our estimates, the recognition of the actual amounts may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows; although that has not been the case during the periods covered by this report. Please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to the Financial Statements for information about significant contingencies involving us.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nPlease see Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see Defined Terms\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCompared with the prior year, the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect lower earnings from operations before income tax of $29.4 million, or 17%, primarily due to factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a net decrease in the volume of retail kWh sold mostly due to milder weather and lower demand due to the impact of COVID-19; and\n\u2022a reduction in revenues due to an accrued regulatory liability for excess earnings under the FAC provisions.\nThese were partially offset by:\n\u2022a decrease in maintenance expenses; and\n\u2022lower pension costs.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion.\nOVERVIEW OF 2020 RESULTS AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE\nThe most important matters on which we focus in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and allocating our resources include: (i) recurring factors which have significant impacts on operating performance such as: regulatory action, environmental matters, weather and weather-related damage in our service area, customer growth and the local economy; (ii) our progress on performance improvement and growth strategies designed to maintain high standards in several operating areas (including safety, customer satisfaction, operations, financial and enterprise-wide performance, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility) simultaneously; and (iii) our short-term and long-term financial and operating strategies. For a discussion of how we are impacted by regulation and environmental matters, please see Note 2, Regulatory Matters\u201d to the Financial Statements and Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOperational Excellence\nOur objective is to optimize IPL's performance in the U.S. utility industry by focusing on the following areas: safety, operations (reliability and customer satisfaction), financial and enterprise-wide performance (efficiency and cost savings, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility). We set and measure these objectives carefully, balancing them in a way and to a degree necessary to ensure a sustainable high level of performance in these areas simultaneously as compared to our peers. We monitor our performance in these areas, and where practical and meaningful, compare performance in some areas to peer utilities. Because some of our financial and enterprise-wide performance measures are company-specific performance goals, they are not benchmarked.\nOur safety performance is measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury near misses. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.\nIPL measures delivery reliability by Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\"CAIDI\"), System Average Interruption Duration Index (\"SAIDI\") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\"SAIFI\") and benchmarks the reliability metrics against other utilities at both the state and national levels. IPL also measures customer centricity on more of an individual basis by the industry metric of Customers that Experience Multiple Interruption of five or more times (\"CEMI-5\"). IPL measures generation reliability by Commercial Availability ( CA\u201d), Equivalent Forced Outage Factor ( EFOF\u201d) and Equivalent Availability Factor ( EAF\u201d) metrics and benchmarks both EFOF and EAF results nationally. We measure Customer Satisfaction using J.D. Power in their Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study and Research America Market Research - Consumer Insight. Monitoring performance in the areas such as competitive rates, operational reliability and customer service supports our ongoing work to deliver reliable service to our customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following review of consolidated results of operations and \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" sections compare the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019. For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2018, see Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nIn addition to the discussion on operations below, please see the Statistical Information on Operations\u201d table included in Item 1.

or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degree days for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degree days in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\nRetail Revenues\nThe decrease in retail revenues of $105.3 million was primarily due to the following (in millions):\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in the volume of kWh sold, primarily due to milder weather in our service territory versus the comparable period and lower demand resulting from impacts of COVID-19 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in the weighted average price of retail kWh sold, primarily due to lower fuel revenues, including a $10.0 million reduction due to excess earnings under FAC provisions (see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\" to the Financial Statements for more information), partially offset by favorable block rate(1) and other retail rate variances\n</td> <td>(40.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other: </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in retail revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Block rate variances are primarily attributable to our declining block rate structure, which generally provides for residential and commercial customers to be charged a higher per kWh rate at lower consumption levels. Therefore, as volumes decrease, the weighted average price per kWh increases and vice versa.\nWholesale Revenues\nThe decrease in wholesale revenues of $22.0 million was primarily due to a $21.5 million volume decrease and a $0.5 million decrease in the weighted average price per kWh sold. We sold 1,866.0 million kWh in the wholesale market during 2020 compared to 2,718.4 million kWh during 2019 primarily due to lower demand and lower unit availability (mostly attributed to the timing of outages). Our ability to be dispatched in the MISO market is primarily driven by the locational marginal price of electricity and variable generation costs. The amount of electricity available for wholesale sales is impacted by our retail load requirements, generation capacity and unit availability.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nThe following table illustrates changes in Operating costs and expenses from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,105 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,466 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(93,361) </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased </td> <td>135,767 </td> <td> </td> <td>133,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,093 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance </td> <td>416,169 </td> <td> </td> <td>428,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,032) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>246,896 </td> <td> </td> <td>240,314 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,582 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income taxes </td> <td>44,516 </td> <td> </td> <td>42,236 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,280 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total operating costs and expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,090,453 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,184,891 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(94,438) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuel\nThe decrease in fuel costs of $93.4 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022a $38.0 million decrease due to the lower price of natural gas consumed versus the comparable period;\n\u2022a $34.4 million decrease in the quantity of fuel consumed versus the comparable period;\n\u2022an $11.6 million decrease from deferred fuel costs; and\n\u2022an $8.9 million decrease due to the lower price of coal consumed versus the comparable period.\nWe are generally permitted to recover underestimated fuel and purchased power costs to serve our retail customers in future rates through quarterly FAC proceedings. These variances are deferred when incurred and amortized into expense in the same period that our rates are adjusted to reflect these variances. For further discussion, please see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Additionally, fuel and purchased power costs incurred for wholesale energy sales are considered in the Off System Sales Margin rider.\nPower Purchased\nThe increase in purchased power costs of $2.1 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022a $48.6 million increase due to a 45% increase in the volume of power purchased during the period; partially offset by\n\u2022a $46.7 million decrease in the market price of purchased power.\nThe volume of power purchased each period is primarily influenced by retail demand, generating unit capacity and outages, and the relative cost of producing power versus purchasing power in the market. The primary driver for the $48.6 million volume increase was due to IPL's generation units running less frequently during 2020 due to lower market prices of purchased power, as well as the timing and duration of outages during these respective periods. The market price of purchased power is influenced primarily by changes in the market price of delivered fuel (primarily natural gas), the supply of and demand for electricity, and the time of day during which power is purchased.\nOperation and Maintenance\nThe decrease in Operation and maintenance expense of $12.0 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022decreased maintenance expenses of $13.7 million primarily due to decreased outage costs; and\n\u2022a $6.2 million write-off of materials and supplies inventory recorded in December 2019 (for further discussion, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filing\u201d).\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022increase in MISO non-purchased power costs (primarily transmission related expenses) of $4.3 million; and\n\u2022higher DSM program costs of $3.2 million (these program costs are recoverable through customer rates and are offset by an increase in DSM revenues).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in Depreciation and amortization expense of $6.6 million was mostly attributed to the impact of additional assets placed in service.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\nThe increase in Taxes other than income taxes of $2.3 million was mostly attributed to higher property taxes of $1.9 million primarily as a result of higher assessed values.\nOther Income / (Expense), Net\nThe following table illustrates changes in Other income / (expense), net from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income/(expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for equity funds used during construction </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,574 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,486 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,088 </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(129,493) </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,771) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,722) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt </td> <td>(2,424) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,424) </td> <td> </td> <td>#DIV/0! </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income / (expense), net </td> <td>3,370 </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,546) </td> <td> </td> <td>13,916 </td> <td> </td> <td>(132.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total other income/(expense), net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(123,973) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(128,831) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,858 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in Interest expense of $7.7 million was primarily due to (i) amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate hedges of $5.4 million beginning in April 2020 and (ii) higher interest expense on long-term debt of $3.0 million mostly due to higher rates.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThe increase in Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt of $2.4 million was primarily due to a make-whole premium and write-off of deferred financing costs due to the redemption of $405 million of 2020 IPALCO Notes and $65 million IPALCO Term Loan in the second quarter of 2020.\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe increase in Other income/(expense), net of $13.9 million was primarily due to a decrease in defined benefit plan costs of $16.1 million due to a higher expected return on plan assets compared to the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table illustrates changes in income tax expense from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,592 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,528 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,936) </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in income tax expense of $6.9 million was primarily due to lower pretax income versus the comparable period.\nKEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring 2021 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition, our financial results will likely be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n\u25aathe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulation; and\n\u25aatimely recovery of capital expenditures.\nIf favorable outcomes related to these factors do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this report impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, then these factors, or other factors unknown to us, may impact our operating margin, net income and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For a discussion of the risks related to our business, see Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor of Indiana also issued an Executive Order prohibiting electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers through August 14, 2020, which prohibition has lapsed.\nIn addition to the impacts to demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, and such expenses may include those that relate to events outside of our control. We experienced impacts from the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021 and expect to continue to experience impacts for the remainder of 2021, and any such impacts during that time or in other future periods could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook based on information known as of this filing. Also see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Continuity - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure our ability to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electric energy, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities and to provide essential services to the communities in which we operate. We continue to respond to this global crisis through comprehensive measures to protect our employees and others while fulfilling our vital role in providing our customers with electric energy. While stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted in our service territory, most of our management and administrative personnel are able to work remotely, and we have not experienced significant issues affecting our operations or ability to maintain effective internal controls and produce reliable financial information.\nDemand - The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to materialize in Indiana in the second half of March 2020 and continued for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. See Note 15, \"Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19 Pandemic\" for further discussion of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our sales demand and Note 13, \"Revenue\" to the Financial Statements for a disaggregation of retail revenues by customer class. The declines for small and large commercial and industrial customers were most severe in April and May, and partially\nrecovered the remainder of the year as stay-at-home orders were lifted. While we cannot predict the length and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic or how it could ultimately impact global or local economic conditions, continuous and/or further declines in future demand would adversely impact our financial results for 2021 and beyond.\nLiquidity - We anticipate continuing to have sufficient liquidity to make all required payments, including payments for salaries and wages owed to our employees, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also continue to not foresee a significant impact to our access to capital or our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020, IPALCO accessed the capital markets to issue $475 million in principal amount of 4.25%, ten-year notes, which has been used to repay IPALCO debt due to mature in 2020. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020 IPL issued $90 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds and used the proceeds to refund $90 million of Indiana Finance Authority Environmental Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 2015A&B. For further discussion of our financial condition, liquidity, and capital requirements, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\" of this Form 10-K.\nCredit Exposures - We continue to monitor and manage our credit exposures in a prudent manner. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and into 2021, we experienced credit-related impacts from utility customers due to the prohibition of electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers and due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in an increase in past due customer receivable balances, and our allowance for credit losses has increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Accounts Receivable\" for further discussion of our allowance for credit losses. If these credit-related impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue into 2021 or beyond, further deterioration in our credit exposures and customer collections may result. See Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters\" for a discussion of regulatory measures which mitigate this impact.\nSupply Chain - Our supply chain management has remained robust during this challenging time and we continue to closely manage and monitor developments.\nCapital Projects - During the COVID-19 pandemic, our construction projects are proceeding without material delays. For further discussion of our capital requirements, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\" of this Form 10-K.\nCARES Act - The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. While we currently expect a limited impact from this legislation on our business, we have deferred the payment of federal payroll taxes in accordance with the provisions of this act. At December 31, 2020, the total deferral was approximately $2.5 million.\nSee Note 15, \"Risks and Uncertainties\" to the Financial Statements and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperational\nAs part of IPL's December 2019 Integrated Resource Plan filing, IPL has plans to retire 630 MW of coal-fired generation at Petersburg Units 1 and 2. IPL issued an all-source request for proposal to competitively procure replacement capacity by June 1, 2023, which is the first year IPL is expected to have a capacity shortfall. Proposals were received through February 28, 2020 and are currently being evaluated. On February 5, 2021, IPL announced an agreement to acquire a 195 MW solar project, subject to approval from the IURC. For further discussion, see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - IRP Filing\" of this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Environment\nFor a discussion of the regulatory environment related to our business, see Item 1. Business - Regulation\u201d and Note 2, Regulatory Matters\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Political\nReference Rate Reform\nIn July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Association (\"IBA\") announced it had begun consultation on its intention to cease publication of two specific LIBOR rates by December 31, 2021, while extending the timeline for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. The IBA expects to make separate announcements in this regard following the outcome of the consultation. We maintain financial instruments that use LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark. Although the full impact of the reform remains unknown, we have begun to engage with our counterparties to discuss specific action items to be undertaken in order to prepare for amendments when they become due.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $20.5 million and available borrowing capacity of $175 million under our unsecured revolving Credit Agreement. All of IPL's long-term borrowings must first be approved by the IURC and the aggregate amount of IPL's short-term indebtedness must be approved by the FERC. We have approval from the FERC to borrow up to $500 million of short-term indebtedness outstanding at any time through July 26, 2022. In December 2018, we received an order from the IURC granting us authority through December 31, 2021 to, among other things, issue up to $350 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, all of which authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020, and refinance up to $185 million in existing indebtedness, of which $95 million of authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. This order also grants us authority to have up to $500 million of long-term credit agreements and liquidity facilities outstanding at any one time, of which $250 million remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. As an alternative to the sale of all or a portion of $65 million in principal of the long-term debt, we have the authority to issue up to $65 million of new preferred stock, all of which authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. We also have restrictions on the amount of new debt that may be issued due to contractual obligations of AES and by financial covenant restrictions under our existing debt obligations. We do not believe such restrictions will be a limiting factor in our ability to issue debt in the ordinary course of prudent business operations.\nWe believe that existing cash balances, cash generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity on our committed Credit Agreement will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet anticipated operating expenses, interest expense on outstanding indebtedness, recurring capital expenditures and to pay dividends to AES U.S. Investments and CDPQ. Sources for principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and nonrecurring capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from: (i) existing cash balances; (ii) cash generated from operating activities; (iii) borrowing capacity on our committed Credit Agreement; (iv) additional debt financing; and (v) equity capital contributions. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes such repurchases are favorable to make. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.\nIPL First Mortgage Bonds\nIn December 2020, the Indiana Finance Authority issued on behalf of IPL an aggregate principal amount of $90 million of Environmental Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2020A&B due December 2038. For further discussion, please see Note 7, \" Debt - IPL First Mortgage Bonds.\"\nIPL has $95 million of 3.875% IPL first mortgage bonds that are due August 1, 2021. For further discussion, please see Note 7, Debt - IPL First Mortgage Bonds.\u201d\nIPALCO's Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan\nIn April 2020, IPALCO completed the sale of the $475 million 2030 IPALCO Notes priced at 4.25%, with the net proceeds from this offering used to retire the Term Loan on April 14, 2020. The remaining net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the 2020 IPALCO Notes on May 14, 2020, and to pay certain related fees,\nexpenses and make-whole premiums. For further discussion, please see Note 7, Debt - IPALCO's Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan.\u201d\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td>

Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional details on each of these projects.\nCapital Resources\nAs IPALCO is a holding company, substantially all of its cash is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries, principally IPL. None of its subsidiaries, including IPL, are obligated under or have guaranteed to make payments with respect to the 2024 IPALCO Notes or the 2030 IPALCO Notes; however, all of IPL's common stock is pledged to secure these debt obligations. Accordingly, IPALCO's ability to make payments on the 2024 IPALCO Notes and the 2030 IPALCO Notes depends on the ability of IPL to generate cash and distribute it to IPALCO.\nLiquidity\nWe expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, potential margin requirements related to interest rate and commodity hedges, taxes and dividend payments. For 2021 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations, funds from debt financing, and funds from equity capital contributions as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods. The absence of adequate liquidity could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIndebtedness\nSignificant Debt Transactions\nFor further discussion of our significant debt transactions, please see Note 7, Debt\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nLine of Credit\nIPL entered into an amendment and restatement of its 5-year $250 million revolving credit facility on June 19, 2019 with a syndication of bank lenders, as discussed in Note 7, Debt - Line of Credit\u201d to the Financial Statements. This Credit Agreement is an unsecured committed line of credit to be used: (i) to finance capital expenditures; (ii) to refinance certain existing indebtedness, (iii) to support working capital; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nWe had the following amounts available under the revolving Credit Agreement:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Commitment </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts available at December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Ratings\nOur ability to borrow money or to refinance existing indebtedness and the interest rates at which we can borrow money or refinance existing indebtedness are affected by our credit ratings. In addition, the applicable interest rates on IPL's Credit Agreement (as well as the amount of certain other fees in the Credit Agreement) are dependent\nupon the credit ratings of IPL. Downgrades in the credit ratings of AES could result in IPL's and/or IPALCO's credit ratings being downgraded. Any reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities.\nThe following table presents the debt ratings and credit ratings (issuer/corporate rating) and outlook for IPALCO and IPL, along with the dates each rating was effective or affirmed.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>IPALCO </td> <td> </td> <td>IPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective or Affirmed </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa3 (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A2 (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P Global Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A- (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>IPALCO </td> <td> </td> <td>IPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective or Affirmed </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P Global Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Ratings relate to IPALCO's Senior Secured Notes.\n(b)Ratings relate to IPL's Senior Secured Bonds.\nWe cannot predict whether our current debt and credit ratings or the debt and credit ratings of IPL will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nOur non-contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are set forth below:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment due </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term and long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,758.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,143.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>1,930.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,366.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal, gas, purchased power and </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> related transportation </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>188.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,060.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,040.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term and long-term debt:\nOur short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2020 consists of outstanding borrowings on the committed line of credit, IPL first mortgage bonds and IPALCO long-term debt. These long-term debt amounts include current maturities but exclude unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing costs. See Note 7, \"Debt\" to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nInterest obligations:\nInterest payment obligations are associated with the short-term and long-term debt described above. The interest payments relating to variable-rate debt are projected using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020.\nPurchase obligations:\nPurchase commitments for coal, gas, purchased power and related transportation:\nIPL enters into long-term contracts for the purchase of coal, gas, purchased power and related transportation. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances.\nPurchase orders and other contractual obligations:\nAt December 31, 2020, we had various other contractual obligations including contracts to purchase goods and services with various terms and expiration dates. Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and payment of future obligations to the Service Company, and our ability to terminate such obligations upon 90 days' notice, we have excluded such amounts in the contractual obligations table above. This table also does not include (i) regulatory liabilities (see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters\"), (ii) derivatives and incentive compensation (see Note 5, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"), (iii) taxes (see Note 8, \"Income Taxes\"), (iv) pension and other postretirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 9, \"Benefit Plans\") and (v) contingencies (see Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"). See the indicated notes to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded.\nReserve for uncertain tax positions:\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $7.4 million at December 31, 2020, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included such amounts in the contractual obligations table above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period presented. Therefore, the possibility exists for materially different reported amounts under different conditions or assumptions. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements. This section addresses only those accounting policies involving amounts material to our financial statements that require the most estimation, judgment or assumptions and should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues related to the sale of energy are generally recognized when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is accrued. In making our estimates of unbilled revenue, we use complex models that consider various factors including daily generation volumes; known amounts of energy usage by nearly all residential, small commercial and industrial customers; estimated line losses; and estimated customer rates based on prior period billings. Given the use of these models, and that customers are billed on a monthly cycle, we believe it is unlikely that materially different results will occur in future periods when revenue is billed. The effect on 2020 revenues and ending unbilled revenues of a one percentage point change in estimated line losses for the month of December 2020 is immaterial. An allowance for potential credit losses is maintained and amounts are written off when normal collection efforts have been exhausted.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcome of tax examinations when determining the adequacy of our income tax provisions by considering the technical merits of the filing position, case law, and\nresults of previous tax examinations. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of our income tax positions. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While we believe that the amount of the tax reserves is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nRegulation\nAs a regulated utility, we apply the provisions of ASC 980 Regulated Operations,\u201d which gives recognition to the ratemaking and accounting practices of the IURC and the FERC. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds or future rate reductions to customers for previous overcollections or the deferral of revenues collected for costs that IPL expects to incur in the future. Specific regulatory assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 2, Regulatory Matters - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\u201d to the Financial Statements.\nThe deferral of costs (as regulatory assets) is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable. In assessing probability, we consider such factors as specific orders from the IURC, regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment. To the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed probable, related regulatory assets would be required to be expensed in current period earnings. Our regulatory assets and liabilities have been created pursuant to specific orders of the IURC or established regulatory practices, such as other utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC being granted recovery of similar costs. It is probable, but not certain, that these regulatory assets will be recoverable, subject to IURC approval.\nAROs\nIn accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for AROs, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are required to be recognized at their fair value at the time those obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a legal liability, costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. These GAAP provisions also require that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon future retirement, whether legal AROs or not, must be removed from a company's accumulated depreciation reserve and be reclassified as a regulatory liability. We make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses as they relate to AROs. These assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time. See Note 3, \"Property, Plant and Equipment - ARO\" to the Financial Statements for more information.\nPension Costs\nWe account for and disclose pension and postemployment benefits in accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for pension and other postemployment plans. These GAAP provisions require the use of assumptions, such as the discount rate for liabilities and long-term rate of return on assets, in determining the obligations, annual cost and funding requirements of the plans.\nContingencies\nWe accrue for loss contingencies when the amount of the loss is probable and estimable. We are subject to various environmental regulations and are involved in certain legal proceedings. If our actual environmental and/or legal obligations are different from our estimates, the recognition of the actual amounts may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows; although that has not been the case during the periods covered by this report. Please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to the Financial Statements for information about significant contingencies involving us.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nPlease see Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see Defined Terms\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCompared with the prior year, the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect lower earnings from operations before income tax of $29.4 million, or 17%, primarily due to factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a net decrease in the volume of retail kWh sold mostly due to milder weather and lower demand due to the impact of COVID-19; and\n\u2022a reduction in revenues due to an accrued regulatory liability for excess earnings under the FAC provisions.\nThese were partially offset by:\n\u2022a decrease in maintenance expenses; and\n\u2022lower pension costs.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion.\nOVERVIEW OF 2020 RESULTS AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE\nThe most important matters on which we focus in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and allocating our resources include: (i) recurring factors which have significant impacts on operating performance such as: regulatory action, environmental matters, weather and weather-related damage in our service area, customer growth and the local economy; (ii) our progress on performance improvement and growth strategies designed to maintain high standards in several operating areas (including safety, customer satisfaction, operations, financial and enterprise-wide performance, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility) simultaneously; and (iii) our short-term and long-term financial and operating strategies. For a discussion of how we are impacted by regulation and environmental matters, please see Note 2, Regulatory Matters\u201d to the Financial Statements and Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOperational Excellence\nOur objective is to optimize IPL's performance in the U.S. utility industry by focusing on the following areas: safety, operations (reliability and customer satisfaction), financial and enterprise-wide performance (efficiency and cost savings, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility). We set and measure these objectives carefully, balancing them in a way and to a degree necessary to ensure a sustainable high level of performance in these areas simultaneously as compared to our peers. We monitor our performance in these areas, and where practical and meaningful, compare performance in some areas to peer utilities. Because some of our financial and enterprise-wide performance measures are company-specific performance goals, they are not benchmarked.\nOur safety performance is measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury near misses. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.\nIPL measures delivery reliability by Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\"CAIDI\"), System Average Interruption Duration Index (\"SAIDI\") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\"SAIFI\") and benchmarks the reliability metrics against other utilities at both the state and national levels. IPL also measures customer centricity on more of an individual basis by the industry metric of Customers that Experience Multiple Interruption of five or more times (\"CEMI-5\"). IPL measures generation reliability by Commercial Availability ( CA\u201d), Equivalent Forced Outage Factor ( EFOF\u201d) and Equivalent Availability Factor ( EAF\u201d) metrics and benchmarks both EFOF and EAF results nationally. We measure Customer Satisfaction using J.D. Power in their Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study and Research America Market Research - Consumer Insight. Monitoring performance in the areas such as competitive rates, operational reliability and customer service supports our ongoing work to deliver reliable service to our customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following review of consolidated results of operations and \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" sections compare the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019. For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2018, see Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nIn addition to the discussion on operations below, please see the Statistical Information on Operations\u201d table included in Item 1. Business\u201d of this report for additional data such as kWh sales and number of customers by customer class.\nStatements of Operations Highlights\n\n2020 versus 2019\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased in 2020 from the prior year by $128.7 million, which resulted from the following changes (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1) Heating and cooling degree-days are a measure of the relative heating or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degree days for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degree days in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\nRetail Revenues\nThe decrease in retail revenues of $105.3 million was primarily due to the following (in millions):\n\n(1)Block rate variances are primarily attributable to our declining block rate structure, which generally provides for residential and commercial customers to be charged a higher per kWh rate at lower consumption levels. Therefore, as volumes decrease, the weighted average price per kWh increases and vice versa.\nWholesale Revenues\nThe decrease in wholesale revenues of $22.0 million was primarily due to a $21.5 million volume decrease and a $0.5 million decrease in the weighted average price per kWh sold. We sold 1,866.0 million kWh in the wholesale market during 2020 compared to 2,718.4 million kWh during 2019 primarily due to lower demand and lower unit availability (mostly attributed to the timing of outages). Our ability to be dispatched in the MISO market is primarily driven by the locational marginal price of electricity and variable generation costs. The amount of electricity available for wholesale sales is impacted by our retail load requirements, generation capacity and unit availability.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nThe following table illustrates changes in Operating costs and expenses from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\n\nFuel\nThe decrease in fuel costs of $93.4 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022a $38.0 million decrease due to the lower price of natural gas consumed versus the comparable period;\n\u2022a $34.4 million decrease in the quantity of fuel consumed versus the comparable period;\n\u2022an $11.6 million decrease from deferred fuel costs; and\n\u2022an $8.9 million decrease due to the lower price of coal consumed versus the comparable period.\nWe are generally permitted to recover underestimated fuel and purchased power costs to serve our retail customers in future rates through quarterly FAC proceedings. These variances are deferred when incurred and amortized into expense in the same period that our rates are adjusted to reflect these variances. For further discussion, please see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Additionally, fuel and purchased power costs incurred for wholesale energy sales are considered in the Off System Sales Margin rider.\nPower Purchased\nThe increase in purchased power costs of $2.1 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022a $48.6 million increase due to a 45% increase in the volume of power purchased during the period; partially offset by\n\u2022a $46.7 million decrease in the market price of purchased power.\nThe volume of power purchased each period is primarily influenced by retail demand, generating unit capacity and outages, and the relative cost of producing power versus purchasing power in the market. The primary driver for the $48.6 million volume increase was due to IPL's generation units running less frequently during 2020 due to lower market prices of purchased power, as well as the timing and duration of outages during these respective periods. The market price of purchased power is influenced primarily by changes in the market price of delivered fuel (primarily natural gas), the supply of and demand for electricity, and the time of day during which power is purchased.\nOperation and Maintenance\nThe decrease in Operation and maintenance expense of $12.0 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022decreased maintenance expenses of $13.7 million primarily due to decreased outage costs; and\n\u2022a $6.2 million write-off of materials and supplies inventory recorded in December 2019 (for further discussion, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filing\u201d).\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022increase in MISO non-purchased power costs (primarily transmission related expenses) of $4.3 million; and\n\u2022higher DSM program costs of $3.2 million (these program costs are recoverable through customer rates and are offset by an increase in DSM revenues).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in Depreciation and amortization expense of $6.6 million was mostly attributed to the impact of additional assets placed in service.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\nThe increase in Taxes other than income taxes of $2.3 million was mostly attributed to higher property taxes of $1.9 million primarily as a result of higher assessed values.\nOther Income / (Expense), Net\nThe following table illustrates changes in Other income / (expense), net from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\n\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in Interest expense of $7.7 million was primarily due to (i) amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate hedges of $5.4 million beginning in April 2020 and (ii) higher interest expense on long-term debt of $3.0 million mostly due to higher rates.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThe increase in Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt of $2.4 million was primarily due to a make-whole premium and write-off of deferred financing costs due to the redemption of $405 million of 2020 IPALCO Notes and $65 million IPALCO Term Loan in the second quarter of 2020.\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe increase in Other income/(expense), net of $13.9 million was primarily due to a decrease in defined benefit plan costs of $16.1 million due to a higher expected return on plan assets compared to the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table illustrates changes in income tax expense from 2019 to 2020 (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in income tax expense of $6.9 million was primarily due to lower pretax income versus the comparable period.\nKEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring 2021 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition, our financial results will likely be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n\u25aathe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulation; and\n\u25aatimely recovery of capital expenditures.\nIf favorable outcomes related to these factors do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this report impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, then these factors, or other factors unknown to us, may impact our operating margin, net income and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For a discussion of the risks related to our business, see Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor of Indiana also issued an Executive Order prohibiting electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers through August 14, 2020, which prohibition has lapsed.\nIn addition to the impacts to demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, and such expenses may include those that relate to events outside of our control. We experienced impacts from the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021 and expect to continue to experience impacts for the remainder of 2021, and any such impacts during that time or in other future periods could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook based on information known as of this filing. Also see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Continuity - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure our ability to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electric energy, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities and to provide essential services to the communities in which we operate. We continue to respond to this global crisis through comprehensive measures to protect our employees and others while fulfilling our vital role in providing our customers with electric energy. While stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted in our service territory, most of our management and administrative personnel are able to work remotely, and we have not experienced significant issues affecting our operations or ability to maintain effective internal controls and produce reliable financial information.\nDemand - The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to materialize in Indiana in the second half of March 2020 and continued for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. See Note 15, \"Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19 Pandemic\" for further discussion of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our sales demand and Note 13, \"Revenue\" to the Financial Statements for a disaggregation of retail revenues by customer class. The declines for small and large commercial and industrial customers were most severe in April and May, and partially\nrecovered the remainder of the year as stay-at-home orders were lifted. While we cannot predict the length and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic or how it could ultimately impact global or local economic conditions, continuous and/or further declines in future demand would adversely impact our financial results for 2021 and beyond.\nLiquidity - We anticipate continuing to have sufficient liquidity to make all required payments, including payments for salaries and wages owed to our employees, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also continue to not foresee a significant impact to our access to capital or our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020, IPALCO accessed the capital markets to issue $475 million in principal amount of 4.25%, ten-year notes, which has been used to repay IPALCO debt due to mature in 2020. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020 IPL issued $90 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds and used the proceeds to refund $90 million of Indiana Finance Authority Environmental Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 2015A&B. For further discussion of our financial condition, liquidity, and capital requirements, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\" of this Form 10-K.\nCredit Exposures - We continue to monitor and manage our credit exposures in a prudent manner. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and into 2021, we experienced credit-related impacts from utility customers due to the prohibition of electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers and due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in an increase in past due customer receivable balances, and our allowance for credit losses has increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Accounts Receivable\" for further discussion of our allowance for credit losses. If these credit-related impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue into 2021 or beyond, further deterioration in our credit exposures and customer collections may result. See Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters\" for a discussion of regulatory measures which mitigate this impact.\nSupply Chain - Our supply chain management has remained robust during this challenging time and we continue to closely manage and monitor developments.\nCapital Projects - During the COVID-19 pandemic, our construction projects are proceeding without material delays. For further discussion of our capital requirements, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\" of this Form 10-K.\nCARES Act - The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. While we currently expect a limited impact from this legislation on our business, we have deferred the payment of federal payroll taxes in accordance with the provisions of this act. At December 31, 2020, the total deferral was approximately $2.5 million.\nSee Note 15, \"Risks and Uncertainties\" to the Financial Statements and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperational\nAs part of IPL's December 2019 Integrated Resource Plan filing, IPL has plans to retire 630 MW of coal-fired generation at Petersburg Units 1 and 2. IPL issued an all-source request for proposal to competitively procure replacement capacity by June 1, 2023, which is the first year IPL is expected to have a capacity shortfall. Proposals were received through February 28, 2020 and are currently being evaluated. On February 5, 2021, IPL announced an agreement to acquire a 195 MW solar project, subject to approval from the IURC. For further discussion, see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters - IRP Filing\" of this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Environment\nFor a discussion of the regulatory environment related to our business, see Item 1. Business - Regulation\u201d and Note 2, Regulatory Matters\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Political\nReference Rate Reform\nIn July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Association (\"IBA\") announced it had begun consultation on its intention to cease publication of two specific LIBOR rates by December 31, 2021, while extending the timeline for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. The IBA expects to make separate announcements in this regard following the outcome of the consultation. We maintain financial instruments that use LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark. Although the full impact of the reform remains unknown, we have begun to engage with our counterparties to discuss specific action items to be undertaken in order to prepare for amendments when they become due.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $20.5 million and available borrowing capacity of $175 million under our unsecured revolving Credit Agreement. All of IPL's long-term borrowings must first be approved by the IURC and the aggregate amount of IPL's short-term indebtedness must be approved by the FERC. We have approval from the FERC to borrow up to $500 million of short-term indebtedness outstanding at any time through July 26, 2022. In December 2018, we received an order from the IURC granting us authority through December 31, 2021 to, among other things, issue up to $350 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, all of which authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020, and refinance up to $185 million in existing indebtedness, of which $95 million of authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. This order also grants us authority to have up to $500 million of long-term credit agreements and liquidity facilities outstanding at any one time, of which $250 million remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. As an alternative to the sale of all or a portion of $65 million in principal of the long-term debt, we have the authority to issue up to $65 million of new preferred stock, all of which authority remains available under the order as of December 31, 2020. We also have restrictions on the amount of new debt that may be issued due to contractual obligations of AES and by financial covenant restrictions under our existing debt obligations. We do not believe such restrictions will be a limiting factor in our ability to issue debt in the ordinary course of prudent business operations.\nWe believe that existing cash balances, cash generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity on our committed Credit Agreement will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet anticipated operating expenses, interest expense on outstanding indebtedness, recurring capital expenditures and to pay dividends to AES U.S. Investments and CDPQ. Sources for principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and nonrecurring capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from: (i) existing cash balances; (ii) cash generated from operating activities; (iii) borrowing capacity on our committed Credit Agreement; (iv) additional debt financing; and (v) equity capital contributions. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes such repurchases are favorable to make. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.\nIPL First Mortgage Bonds\nIn December 2020, the Indiana Finance Authority issued on behalf of IPL an aggregate principal amount of $90 million of Environmental Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2020A&B due December 2038. For further discussion, please see Note 7, \" Debt - IPL First Mortgage Bonds.\"\nIPL has $95 million of 3.875% IPL first mortgage bonds that are due August 1, 2021. For further discussion, please see Note 7, Debt - IPL First Mortgage Bonds.\u201d\nIPALCO's Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan\nIn April 2020, IPALCO completed the sale of the $475 million 2030 IPALCO Notes priced at 4.25%, with the net proceeds from this offering used to retire the Term Loan on April 14, 2020. The remaining net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the 2020 IPALCO Notes on May 14, 2020, and to pay certain related fees,\nexpenses and make-whole premiums. For further discussion, please see Note 7, Debt - IPALCO's Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan.\u201d\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows:\n\n2020 versus 2019\nOperating Activities\nThe following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated operating cash flows:\n\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by the following (in thousands):\n\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily driven by (in thousands):\n\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily driven by (in thousands):\n\nCapital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditure program, including development and permitting costs, for the three-year period from 2021 through 2023 is currently estimated to cost approximately $1.5 billion (excluding environmental compliance), and includes estimates as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nThe amounts described in the capital expenditure program above include spending under IPL's TDSIC plan approved by the IURC on March 4, 2020 for eligible transmission, distribution and storage system improvements totaling $1.2 billion from 2020 through 2027 (which includes estimated spending of $176.5 million in 2021, $190.0 million in 2022 and $212.6 million in 2023, respectively). Total TDSIC costs expended through December 31, 2020 were $145.8 million.\nAdditionally, estimated capital expenditure spending on environmental compliance costs for the three-year period from 2021 through 2023 includes the following (amounts in millions):\n\nPlease see Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional details on each of these projects.\nCapital Resources\nAs IPALCO is a holding company, substantially all of its cash is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries, principally IPL. None of its subsidiaries, including IPL, are obligated under or have guaranteed to make payments with respect to the 2024 IPALCO Notes or the 2030 IPALCO Notes; however, all of IPL's common stock is pledged to secure these debt obligations. Accordingly, IPALCO's ability to make payments on the 2024 IPALCO Notes and the 2030 IPALCO Notes depends on the ability of IPL to generate cash and distribute it to IPALCO.\nLiquidity\nWe expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, potential margin requirements related to interest rate and commodity hedges, taxes and dividend payments. For 2021 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations, funds from debt financing, and funds from equity capital contributions as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods. The absence of adequate liquidity could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIndebtedness\nSignificant Debt Transactions\nFor further discussion of our significant debt transactions, please see Note 7, Debt\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nLine of Credit\nIPL entered into an amendment and restatement of its 5-year $250 million revolving credit facility on June 19, 2019 with a syndication of bank lenders, as discussed in Note 7, Debt - Line of Credit\u201d to the Financial Statements. This Credit Agreement is an unsecured committed line of credit to be used: (i) to finance capital expenditures; (ii) to refinance certain existing indebtedness, (iii) to support working capital; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nWe had the following amounts available under the revolving Credit Agreement:\n\nCredit Ratings\nOur ability to borrow money or to refinance existing indebtedness and the interest rates at which we can borrow money or refinance existing indebtedness are affected by our credit ratings. In addition, the applicable interest rates on IPL's Credit Agreement (as well as the amount of certain other fees in the Credit Agreement) are dependent\nupon the credit ratings of IPL. Downgrades in the credit ratings of AES could result in IPL's and/or IPALCO's credit ratings being downgraded. Any reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities.\nThe following table presents the debt ratings and credit ratings (issuer/corporate rating) and outlook for IPALCO and IPL, along with the dates each rating was effective or affirmed.\n\n(a)Ratings relate to IPALCO's Senior Secured Notes.\n(b)Ratings relate to IPL's Senior Secured Bonds.\nWe cannot predict whether our current debt and credit ratings or the debt and credit ratings of IPL will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nOur non-contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are set forth below:\n\nShort-term and long-term debt:\nOur short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2020 consists of outstanding borrowings on the committed line of credit, IPL first mortgage bonds and IPALCO long-term debt. These long-term debt amounts include current maturities but exclude unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing costs. See Note 7, \"Debt\" to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nInterest obligations:\nInterest payment obligations are associated with the short-term and long-term debt described above. The interest payments relating to variable-rate debt are projected using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020.\nPurchase obligations:\nPurchase commitments for coal, gas, purchased power and related transportation:\nIPL enters into long-term contracts for the purchase of coal, gas, purchased power and related transportation. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances.\nPurchase orders and other contractual obligations:\nAt December 31, 2020, we had various other contractual obligations including contracts to purchase goods and services with various terms and expiration dates. Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and payment of future obligations to the Service Company, and our ability to terminate such obligations upon 90 days' notice, we have excluded such amounts in the contractual obligations table above. This table also does not include (i) regulatory liabilities (see Note 2, \"Regulatory Matters\"), (ii) derivatives and incentive compensation (see Note 5, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"), (iii) taxes (see Note 8, \"Income Taxes\"), (iv) pension and other postretirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 9, \"Benefit Plans\") and (v) contingencies (see Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"). See the indicated notes to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded.\nReserve for uncertain tax positions:\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $7.4 million at December 31, 2020, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included such amounts in the contractual obligations table above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period presented. Therefore, the possibility exists for materially different reported amounts under different conditions or assumptions. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements. This section addresses only those accounting policies involving amounts material to our financial statements that require the most estimation, judgment or assumptions and should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues related to the sale of energy are generally recognized when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is accrued. In making our estimates of unbilled revenue, we use complex models that consider various factors including daily generation volumes; known amounts of energy usage by nearly all residential, small commercial and industrial customers; estimated line losses; and estimated customer rates based on prior period billings. Given the use of these models, and that customers are billed on a monthly cycle, we believe it is unlikely that materially different results will occur in future periods when revenue is billed. The effect on 2020 revenues and ending unbilled revenues of a one percentage point change in estimated line losses for the month of December 2020 is immaterial. An allowance for potential credit losses is maintained and amounts are written off when normal collection efforts have been exhausted.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcome of tax examinations when determining the adequacy of our income tax provisions by considering the technical merits of the filing position, case law, and\nresults of previous tax examinations. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of our income tax positions. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While we believe that the amount of the tax reserves is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nRegulation\nAs a regulated utility, we apply the provisions of ASC 980 Regulated Operations,\u201d which gives recognition to the ratemaking and accounting practices of the IURC and the FERC. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds or future rate reductions to customers for previous overcollections or the deferral of revenues collected for costs that IPL expects to incur in the future. Specific regulatory assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 2, Regulatory Matters - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\u201d to the Financial Statements.\nThe deferral of costs (as regulatory assets) is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable. In assessing probability, we consider such factors as specific orders from the IURC, regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment. To the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed probable, related regulatory assets would be required to be expensed in current period earnings. Our regulatory assets and liabilities have been created pursuant to specific orders of the IURC or established regulatory practices, such as other utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC being granted recovery of similar costs. It is probable, but not certain, that these regulatory assets will be recoverable, subject to IURC approval.\nAROs\nIn accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for AROs, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are required to be recognized at their fair value at the time those obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a legal liability, costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. These GAAP provisions also require that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon future retirement, whether legal AROs or not, must be removed from a company's accumulated depreciation reserve and be reclassified as a regulatory liability. We make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses as they relate to AROs. These assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time. See Note 3, \"Property, Plant and Equipment - ARO\" to the Financial Statements for more information.\nPension Costs\nWe account for and disclose pension and postemployment benefits in accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for pension and other postemployment plans. These GAAP provisions require the use of assumptions, such as the discount rate for liabilities and long-term rate of return on assets, in determining the obligations, annual cost and funding requirements of the plans.\nContingencies\nWe accrue for loss contingencies when the amount of the loss is probable and estimable. We are subject to various environmental regulations and are involved in certain legal proceedings. If our actual environmental and/or legal obligations are different from our estimates, the recognition of the actual amounts may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows; although that has not been the case during the periods covered by this report. Please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to the Financial Statements for information about significant contingencies involving us.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nPlease see Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to our results of operations, financial

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Revenues decreased in 2020 by $128.7 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower retail kWh sales volume from milder weather and lower demand from COVID-19 impacts, as well as lower revenue per kWh sold.\n\n- Operating income decreased by $34.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by the revenue decline partially offset by lower fuel and maintenance costs. \n\n- Net income decreased by $22.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n- Capital expenditures are estimated at $1.5 billion for 2021-2023, excluding environmental projects. Key areas of investment are transmission, distribution, and power plant upgrades.\n\n- Total debt was $2.76 billion at year-end 2020. Key transactions in 2020 included issuing $475M of 10-year senior secured notes and redeeming $405M of senior secured notes due in 2020.\n\n- COVID-19 negatively impacted sales demand starting in March 2020. Financial impact included lower revenues and higher allowance for credit losses.\n\n- Key financial metrics monitored include safety, reliability, customer satisfaction, operating performance, and environmental compliance. \n\nIn summary, the report discusses the company's 2020 financial performance, capital plans, debt profile, and the impacts of COVID-19. Performance was pressured by lower demand but the company maintained strong liquidity and credit ratings."}
