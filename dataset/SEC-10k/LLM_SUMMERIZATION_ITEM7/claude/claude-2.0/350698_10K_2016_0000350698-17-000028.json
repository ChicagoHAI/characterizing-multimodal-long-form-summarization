MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nExcept to the extent that differences among reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis.\nOverview\nAutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 371 new vehicle franchises from 260 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 35 different new vehicle brands. The core brands of new vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 94% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2016, are manufactured by Toyota (including Lexus), Ford, Honda, General Motors, FCA US, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen (including Audi and Porsche).\nWe offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service,\u201d which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses, and automotive finance and insurance\u201d products, which include vehicle service and other protection products, as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had three reportable segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and FCA US. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus, and Audi. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue, and approximately 19% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 23% of our total revenue, and approximately 10% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 20% of total revenue, contributed approximately 70% of our gross profit.\nMarket Conditions\nFull-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales were 17.5 million in 2016, as compared to 17.5 million in 2015 and 16.5 million in 2014. U.S. industry new vehicle unit retail sales were down 1% as compared to the prior year. We expect that full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales in 2017 will remain above 17 million. However, actual sales may materially differ. Based on industry data, vehicle leasing is at a historically-high level. To the extent that vehicle manufacturers reduce their support for leasing programs, U.S. industry and our new vehicle unit retail sales could be adversely impacted.\nOur new vehicle unit volume and new vehicle gross profit on a per vehicle retailed ( PVR\u201d) basis were adversely impacted by certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive programs, which are based upon store-level growth targets established by those manufacturers, and which result in multi-tier pricing. If those manufacturers continue to use such incentive programs or if other manufacturers adopt similar incentive programs, our operating results could continue to be adversely impacted.\nThe number of recent-model-year vehicles in operation is growing due to increases in the annual rate of new vehicle sales in the United States since 2009. The growth in that portion of our service base, together with our customer retention efforts, has benefited the customer-pay service and warranty components of our parts and service business, and we believe that it will continue to benefit those components for the next several years. While the number of older vehicles in operation\nhas declined in recent years and is expected to continue to decline over the next few years, we believe that overall our parts and service business will benefit from the mix shift in our service base toward newer vehicles.\nResults of Operations\nWe had net income from continuing operations of $431.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.16 in 2016, as compared to net income from continuing operations of $443.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.90 in 2015, and net income from continuing operations of $419.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.53 in 2014.\nOur retail new vehicle unit sales were down slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015. The disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs discussed above under Market Conditions\u201d had a negative impact on our new vehicle unit volume and gross profit PVR. New vehicle gross profit PVR compression was partially offset by continued strength in finance and insurance gross profit PVR. Used vehicle unit volume and gross profit were adversely impacted by the Takata airbag inflator recall discussed below. Our total gross profit for 2016 increased 2%, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015 and an increase in parts and service gross profit.\nNet income from continuing operations benefited from net after-tax gains related to business/property dispositions (net of property impairments) of $30.1 million in 2016, $11.1 million in 2015, and $7.7 million in 2014, as well as net after-tax gains related to legal settlements of $8.9 million in 2016 and $2.5 million in 2014. See Other Income, Net\u201d below.\nStrategic Initiatives\nIn 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand from coast to coast. During 2015, that branding effort was extended to AutoNation Express and the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan. We recently announced the next phase of our comprehensive, customer-focused brand extension strategy, which includes:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>AutoNation USA stand-alone used vehicle sales and service centers, with 25 potential sites identified, five of which are expected to open in 2017,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>AutoNation branded parts and accessories, the launch of which began in the third quarter of 2016, and which will be expanded over the next several years,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expansion of AutoNation branded collision centers, which includes the unification of our collision centers under the AutoNation retail brand and plans to open or acquire at least 18 new collision centers over the next several years, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expansion of AutoNation branded automotive auctions, which, as announced in October 2016, includes plans to open four additional automotive auctions by the end of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that these initiatives will expand and strengthen the AutoNation retail brand, improve the customer experience, provide new growth opportunities, and enable us to expand our footprint in our core and other markets. We expect that our investments in this phase of our brand extension roll-out, which may exceed $500 million in the aggregate, will continue for the next several years. The roll-out of these strategic initiatives may be impacted by a number of variables, including customer adoption, market conditions, and our ability to identify, acquire, and build out suitable locations in a timely manner. See Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with our brand extension strategy, we also launched a one price used vehicle sales model during the second half of 2016. The one price model is planned to be fully implemented in all of our stores by the end of the second quarter of 2017.\nTakata Airbag Inflator Recall\nUsed vehicle unit volume and gross profit in 2016 were adversely impacted by the Takata airbag inflator recall, the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. automotive history. This recall has been disruptive to our business, as the vehicle inventory subject to this recall has been placed on a retail sales-hold by several manufacturers until parts become available to replace the defective airbag inflators. Certain manufacturers provide financial support for select vehicles that are on a retail sales-hold as a result of the recall, which serves to reduce our costs associated with those vehicles. We cannot predict when or how many replacement parts will become available, the number of additional affected vehicles that we will\nacquire through trade-ins, or the amount of financial support we will receive from the manufacturers of such vehicles in the future, and this recall may continue to adversely impact our business.\nInventory Management\nOur new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor our vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and seasonal sales trends.\nWe have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 75,117 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 80,442 units at December 31, 2015. See New Vehicle Inventories\u201d below for more information.\nWe recondition the majority of used vehicles acquired for retail sale in our parts and service departments and capitalize the related costs to the used vehicle inventory. Used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are generally liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $4.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nParts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, manufacturer return policies, and industry trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $3.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $3.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill for our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nUnder accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting units under the two-step goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment as of April 30, 2016, and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $252.1 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $558.2 million related to the Import reporting unit, $697.4 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit, and $3.6 million in Corporate and other.\u201d\nOther Intangible Assets\nOur principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nOur franchise rights, which related to 69 stores and totaled $546.4 million at April 30, 2016, are evaluated for impairment on a franchise-by-franchise basis annually. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of franchise rights impairment to determine whether it was necessary to perform a\nquantitative impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of franchise rights impairment as of April 30, 2016. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that we should perform a quantitative test for certain franchise rights; however, no impairment charges resulted from these quantitative tests.\nThe quantitative impairment test for franchise rights requires the comparison of the franchise rights' estimated fair value to carrying value by store. Fair values of rights under franchise agreements are estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting expected future cash flows of the store. The forecasted cash flows contain inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates, margins, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and cost of capital, for which we utilize certain market participant-based assumptions, using third-party industry projections, economic projections, and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable. If, hypothetically, the fair value of each of the franchise rights quantitatively tested had been determined to be 10% lower as of the valuation date, no impairment charge would have resulted. The effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value estimates is not intended to provide a sensitivity analysis of every potential outcome.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more-likely-than-not a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses.\nWhen evaluating potential impairment of long-lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held and used were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group's carrying amount exceeds the asset group's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset.\nWhen property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long-lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long-lived asset's or disposal group's carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale\u201d criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets.\nWe had assets held for sale in continuing operations of $41.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $47.1 million at December 31, 2015, and assets held for sale in discontinued operations of $15.7 million at December 31, 2016, and $22.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe fair value measurements for our property and equipment and assets held for sale are based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurement valuation process and impairment charges that were recorded during 2016 and 2015. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our\nproperty and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets.\nChargeback Liability\nRevenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for the placement of: (i) loans and leases with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts with third-party providers, and (iii) other vehicle protection products with third-party providers. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however, in certain cases, we also participate in the future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements with the issuers of those contracts, which is recognized as earned.\nWe may be charged back for commissions related to financing, vehicle service contracts, or other vehicle protection products in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by customers ( chargebacks\u201d). However, our exposure to loss generally is limited to the commissions that we receive. These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks.\nWe estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $116.8 million at December 31, 2016, and $97.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nChargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle service contracts and other vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in an adjustment to our estimated liability for chargebacks. The increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to increases in vehicle unit volume and product penetration in recent years, product mix, and an overall increase in the cancellation rates of finance and insurance products. Our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. A 10% change in our estimated cancellation rates would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2016, by approximately $11.5 million.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nUnder our self-insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims-handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers' compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third-party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. Our results could be adversely impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self-insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self-insurance liabilities totaled $75.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $74.8 million at December 31, 2015. Our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs.\nAccounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards prescribe a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.\nReported Operating Data Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The difference between reported amounts and same store amounts in the above tables of $967.4 million, $390.0 million, and $86.9 million in new vehicle revenue and $45.6 million, $16.9 million, and $4.1 million in new vehicle gross profit for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, is related to acquisition and divestiture activity.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSame store new vehicle revenue decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in revenue PVR. The decrease in same store unit volume was primarily due to certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive programs, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\nSame store revenue PVR during 2016 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for vehicles in all three segments, as well as lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store new vehicle revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, as a result of increases in same store unit volume and revenue PVR. The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to replacement demand and improved\nmarket conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and confidence. New product offerings from certain automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted same store unit volume.\nSame store revenue PVR during 2015 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for Domestic and Import vehicles, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price for Premium Luxury vehicles. Same store revenue PVR also benefited from a shift in mix away from Import vehicles, which have relatively lower average selling prices. In addition, same store revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases in gross profit PVR for vehicles at our Premium Luxury and Import stores due to increased inventory levels and changes in manufacturer incentive programs, as well as a competitive automotive retail environment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced greater compression in our new vehicle gross profit PVR due to these factors.\nNet New Vehicle Inventory Carrying Benefit\nThe following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit, consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory). Floorplan assistance is accounted for as a component of new vehicle gross profit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floorplan assistance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New vehicle floorplan interest expense\n</td> <td>(71.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in floorplan interest expense, partially offset by an increase in floorplan assistance. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year, which was due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, and higher interest rates. Floorplan assistance increased due to an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit and benefited from the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in floorplan assistance, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year.\nNew Vehicle Inventories\nOur new vehicle inventories were $2.8 billion or 61 days supply at December 31, 2016, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.9 billion or 68 days supply at December 31, 2015. We had 75,117 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 80,442 units at December 31, 2015. The decrease in new vehicle inventory days supply at December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, is primarily due to steps we have taken to align our inventory in response to the current

The decrease in same store unit volume was driven by a competitive automotive retail environment, as well as a decrease in trade-in volume associated with the decrease in new vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles. Same store unit volume was also\nadversely impacted by manufacturer safety recalls, including the Takata airbag inflator recall, and the application of our previous open safety recall policy. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, we modified our recall policy to permit the retail sale of certain used vehicles with an open recall, where parts are not available to complete the recall and full disclosure is made to the purchaser.\nSame store revenue PVR benefited from an increase in the average selling price of used vehicles for all three segments, and a shift in mix toward Premium Luxury vehicles and the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, both of which have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to margin pressure resulting from new vehicle gross profit PVR compression during the same period combined with the application of our previous open safety recall policy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store retail used vehicle revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increases in same store unit volume and revenue PVR.

Warranty gross profit benefited from an increase in volume, driven by the increase in units in operation in our primary service base. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale was adversely impacted by the decrease in new and used vehicle unit volume.\nSee Strategic Initiatives\u201d above for a discussion of our brand extension strategy, which includes the launch of AutoNation USA stand-alone used vehicles sales and service centers, the launch of AutoNation branded parts and accessories, and the expansion of AutoNation branded collision centers.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store parts and service gross profit increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in gross profit associated with customer-pay service of $33.9 million, warranty of $28.1 million, the preparation of vehicles for sale of $22.6 million, and collision business of $12.5 million.\nCustomer-pay service gross profit benefited from improved operational execution and margin performance, as well as increased volume due to the increase in units in operation in our primary service base. Warranty gross profit also benefited from an increase in volume, driven by the increase in units in operation in our primary service base, as well as elevated\nmanufacturer recall activity. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale benefited from higher new and used vehicle unit volume.

primarily due to increases in new and used vehicle unit volume and new and used vehicle revenue PVR. New and used vehicle unit volume benefited from the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015. New vehicle revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices. Used vehicle revenue PVR benefited from the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices. Domestic revenue was adversely impacted by the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\nDomestic segment income decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, due in part to an increase in SG&A expenses largely due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015.

SG&A expenses in 2016 were also negatively impacted by an increase in hail-related losses of $7.5 million as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable expenses as a result of the decrease in unit volume. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses increased to 70.9% in 2016 from 69.4% in 2015, primarily due to gross profit pressure from the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs discussed above under Market Conditions\u201d and the application of our previous open safety recall policy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSG&A expenses increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a volume-driven increase in variable compensation expense, an increase in store and corporate overhead expenses due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2015, and an increase in advertising expenditures. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased slightly to 69.4% in 2015 from 69.6% in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense as a percentage of total gross profit.\nOther Income, Net (included in Operating Income)\nDuring 2016, we recognized net gains of $61.8 million related to the divestiture of five Domestic stores and nine Import stores, a gain of $14.4 million in connection with a legal settlement related to the Volkswagen diesel emissions litigation, and a gain of $5.5 million related to payments we received to waive certain franchise protest rights. These net gains were partially offset by non-cash property impairments of $14.0 million.\nDuring 2015, we recognized gains related to property dispositions of $16.7 million and the divestiture of three Import stores of $7.4 million. These gains were partially offset by non-cash property impairments of $6.1 million.\nDuring 2014, we recognized a gain related to the divestiture of two Import stores of $4.4 million, a gain related to a legal settlement of $4.0 million, and a net gain related to business/property dispositions of $8.1 million, primarily related to the divestiture of our customer lead distribution business.\nFranchise Rights Impairment\nDuring 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $15.4 million associated with franchise rights recorded at our Volkswagen stores. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNon-Operating Income (Expenses)\nFloorplan Interest Expense\nFloorplan interest expense was $76.5 million in 2016, $58.3 million in 2015, and $53.3 million in 2014. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $18.2 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, is the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances during the year, which was due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, and higher interest rates. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $5.0 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances during the year.\nOther Interest Expense\nOther interest expense was $115.5 million in 2016, $90.9 million in 2015, and $86.7 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense of $24.6 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, was driven by higher average debt balances resulting primarily from share repurchases and acquisitions. The increase in interest expense of $4.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase of $8.3 million resulting from the September 2015 issuance of our 3.35% Senior Notes due 2021 and 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025. This increase was partially offset by decreases in interest expense of $3.3 million due to lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing in December 2014 and our commercial paper program established in May 2015, and $0.6 million resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our mortgage facility.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nWe expensed $1.6 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to our credit facility refinancing transaction. This expense included $0.4 million for the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix.\nOur effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2016. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate was 38.6% in 2015 and was 38.5% in 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated prior to January 1, 2014. Results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge and carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that were closed prior to January 1, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and secured used vehicle floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAvailable Liquidity Resources\nWe had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,058.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,463.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured used floorplan facilities(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As limited by the maximum consolidated leverage ratio in our credit agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016, we had $44.1 million of letters of credit outstanding.

We invest capital in our business to maintain and upgrade our existing facilities and to build new facilities, as well as for other strategic and technology initiatives, including the next phase of our brand extension strategy discussed above under Strategic Initiatives.\u201d We also deploy capital opportunistically to repurchase our common stock and/or debt or to complete dealership acquisitions and/or build facilities for newly awarded franchises. Our capital allocation decisions will be based on factors such as the expected rate of return on our investment, the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the market price of our debt, the potential impact on our capital structure, our ability to complete dealership acquisitions that meet our market and vehicle brand criteria and return on investment threshold, and limitations set forth in our debt agreements.\nShare Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors from time to time authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a certain monetary limit. A summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate purchase price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average purchase price per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, $298.6 million remained available under our stock repurchase limit most recently authorized by our Board of Directors.\nThe decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our\n3.75x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy-outs (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes accrued construction in progress and excludes property associated with capital leases entered into during the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nThe following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in business acquisitions, net(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(410.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(321.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(205.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash received from business divestitures, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Excludes capital leases and deferred purchase price commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, we purchased 20 stores located in Texas, New York, Colorado, California, and Maryland, which include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Sprinter, Jaguar, Land Rover, and BMW franchises.

In 2015, we divested three Import stores. In 2014, we divested two Import stores and our customer lead distribution business, which was reported in the Corporate and other\u201d category of our segment information.\nWe regularly review our store portfolio and may divest stores opportunistically. Since January 1, 2015, we have received $241.2 million of proceeds related to asset sales, including business and real estate divestitures. We have utilized those proceeds, and expect to utilize proceeds from future asset sales, to fund our capital investments and strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes.\nCash Dividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table sets forth our non-vehicle long-term debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.75% Senior Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.5% Senior Notes due 2020\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.35% Senior Notes due 2021\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.5% Senior Notes due 2025\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility due 2019\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage facility(1)\n</td> <td>153.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases and other debt\n</td> <td>136.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1,789.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,770.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current maturities\n</td> <td>(167.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net of current maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,611.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,745.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.6 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $143.9 million due November 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> At December 31, 2016, we had $942.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.26% and a weighted-average remaining term of 24 days.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and commercial paper.\nRestrictions and Covenants\nOur credit agreement, the indentures for our senior unsecured notes, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities.\nUnder our credit agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non-vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non-vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Under our credit agreement, the maximum leverage ratio is 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio is 70.0%. In calculating our leverage and capitalization ratios, we are not required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million). In addition, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are permitted to add back to shareholders' equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long-lived asset impairment charges subsequent to September 30, 2014 plus $1.53 billion. The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our credit agreement, which we filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 4, 2014.\nThe indentures for our senior unsecured notes contain certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our credit agreement, at December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\u2264 3.75x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.70x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization ratio\n</td> <td>\u2264 70.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVehicle Floorplan Payable\nThe components of vehicle floorplan payable are as follows:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicle floorplan payable - trade\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,308.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,565.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicle floorplan payable - non-trade\n</td> <td>1,540.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,161.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Vehicle floorplan payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,727.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our vehicle floorplan payable.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>516.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(489.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(509.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(376.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(102.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts-in-transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and finance and insurance products, collections from customers for the sale of parts and services, and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable-trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable-trade, purchases of parts inventory, personnel-related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, and was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by a decrease in earnings.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, and was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements and an increase in earnings.\nDuring 2014, we paid $7.2 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. Cash flows from operating activities in 2014 reflect $1.2 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to this refinancing transaction. In addition, we charged to expense $0.4 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities in 2014, discussed below, reflect $6.0 million of debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, and other transactions.\nWe will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, partially offset by an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet cash used in investing activities increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in property and equipment purchases, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade, and proceeds from stock option exercises.\n2016 compared to 2015\nUnder our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, during 2016, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $497.0 million (average purchase price per share of $47.30). Additionally, 38,906 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2016 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $235.1 million (average purchase price per share of $60.49). Additionally, 36,712 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2015 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.\nDuring 2015, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.35% Senior Notes due 2021 and $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025. Cash flows from financing activities in 2015 reflect cash payments of $6.4 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt arrangements.\nCash flows from financing activities include changes in commercial paper notes outstanding totaling net proceeds of $342.5 million during 2016 and $599.5 million during 2015.\nDuring 2016, we borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid $1.3 billion under our revolving credit facility. During 2015, we borrowed $1.4 billion and repaid $2.5 billion under our revolving credit facility, for net repayments of $1.1 billion.\nCash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaling net proceeds of $153.8 million during 2016 compared to net repayments of $13.3 million in 2015.\nDuring 2016, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nDuring 2014, we amended and restated our existing unsecured credit agreement and replaced our $500.0 million term loan facility and $1.2 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. The indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from our amended credit agreement. Cash flows from financing activities in 2014 also reflect cash payments of $6.0 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement. During 2014, we borrowed $2.8 billion and repaid $2.0 billion under our revolving credit facilities, for net borrowings of $810.0 million.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during 2015, as compared to 2014, were impacted primarily by the debt activity that occurred in 2015 as compared to 2014, described above, and a decrease in repurchases of common stock.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2016. The amounts presented are based upon, among other things, the terms of any relevant agreements. Future events that may occur related to the following payment obligations could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1\nYear\n(2017)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n(2018 and\n2019)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n(2020 and\n2021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5\nYears\n(2022 and\nthereafter)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including capital leases (Note 7)(1)(2)\n</td> <td>1,789.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>656.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper (Note 7)(1)\n</td> <td>942.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(3)\n</td> <td>392.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease and other commitments (Note 8)(1)(4)\n</td> <td>433.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)(1)\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation obligations(5)\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated chargeback liability (Note 18)(1)(6)\n</td> <td>116.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated self-insurance obligations (Note 6)(1)(7)\n</td> <td>75.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(8)\n</td> <td>113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,789.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,291.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>751.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>819.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Amounts for long-term debt obligations reflect principal payments and are not reduced for unamortized debt discounts of $2.6 million or debt issuance costs of $8.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Primarily represents scheduled fixed interest payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes, mortgage facility, and capital leases.

In the case of payments due upon the maturity of our debt instruments, we currently expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2016, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash\ndeposits totaled $102.7 million, of which $44.1 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit.\nAs further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nExcept to the extent that differences among reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis.\nOverview\nAutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 371 new vehicle franchises from 260 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 35 different new vehicle brands. The core brands of new vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 94% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2016, are manufactured by Toyota (including Lexus), Ford, Honda, General Motors, FCA US, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen (including Audi and Porsche).\nWe offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service,\u201d which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses, and automotive finance and insurance\u201d products, which include vehicle service and other protection products, as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had three reportable segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and FCA US. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus, and Audi. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue, and approximately 19% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 23% of our total revenue, and approximately 10% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 20% of total revenue, contributed approximately 70% of our gross profit.\nMarket Conditions\nFull-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales were 17.5 million in 2016, as compared to 17.5 million in 2015 and 16.5 million in 2014. U.S. industry new vehicle unit retail sales were down 1% as compared to the prior year. We expect that full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales in 2017 will remain above 17 million. However, actual sales may materially differ. Based on industry data, vehicle leasing is at a historically-high level. To the extent that vehicle manufacturers reduce their support for leasing programs, U.S. industry and our new vehicle unit retail sales could be adversely impacted.\nOur new vehicle unit volume and new vehicle gross profit on a per vehicle retailed ( PVR\u201d) basis were adversely impacted by certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive programs, which are based upon store-level growth targets established by those manufacturers, and which result in multi-tier pricing. If those manufacturers continue to use such incentive programs or if other manufacturers adopt similar incentive programs, our operating results could continue to be adversely impacted.\nThe number of recent-model-year vehicles in operation is growing due to increases in the annual rate of new vehicle sales in the United States since 2009. The growth in that portion of our service base, together with our customer retention efforts, has benefited the customer-pay service and warranty components of our parts and service business, and we believe that it will continue to benefit those components for the next several years. While the number of older vehicles in operation\nhas declined in recent years and is expected to continue to decline over the next few years, we believe that overall our parts and service business will benefit from the mix shift in our service base toward newer vehicles.\nResults of Operations\nWe had net income from continuing operations of $431.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.16 in 2016, as compared to net income from continuing operations of $443.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.90 in 2015, and net income from continuing operations of $419.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.53 in 2014.\nOur retail new vehicle unit sales were down slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015. The disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs discussed above under Market Conditions\u201d had a negative impact on our new vehicle unit volume and gross profit PVR. New vehicle gross profit PVR compression was partially offset by continued strength in finance and insurance gross profit PVR. Used vehicle unit volume and gross profit were adversely impacted by the Takata airbag inflator recall discussed below. Our total gross profit for 2016 increased 2%, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015 and an increase in parts and service gross profit.\nNet income from continuing operations benefited from net after-tax gains related to business/property dispositions (net of property impairments) of $30.1 million in 2016, $11.1 million in 2015, and $7.7 million in 2014, as well as net after-tax gains related to legal settlements of $8.9 million in 2016 and $2.5 million in 2014. See Other Income, Net\u201d below.\nStrategic Initiatives\nIn 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand from coast to coast. During 2015, that branding effort was extended to AutoNation Express and the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan. We recently announced the next phase of our comprehensive, customer-focused brand extension strategy, which includes:\n \u2022 AutoNation USA stand-alone used vehicle sales and service centers, with 25 potential sites identified, five of which are expected to open in 2017, \n \u2022 AutoNation branded parts and accessories, the launch of which began in the third quarter of 2016, and which will be expanded over the next several years, \n \u2022 the expansion of AutoNation branded collision centers, which includes the unification of our collision centers under the AutoNation retail brand and plans to open or acquire at least 18 new collision centers over the next several years, and \n \u2022 the expansion of AutoNation branded automotive auctions, which, as announced in October 2016, includes plans to open four additional automotive auctions by the end of 2018.  We expect that these initiatives will expand and strengthen the AutoNation retail brand, improve the customer experience, provide new growth opportunities, and enable us to expand our footprint in our core and other markets. We expect that our investments in this phase of our brand extension roll-out, which may exceed $500 million in the aggregate, will continue for the next several years. The roll-out of these strategic initiatives may be impacted by a number of variables, including customer adoption, market conditions, and our ability to identify, acquire, and build out suitable locations in a timely manner. See Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with our brand extension strategy, we also launched a one price used vehicle sales model during the second half of 2016. The one price model is planned to be fully implemented in all of our stores by the end of the second quarter of 2017.\nTakata Airbag Inflator Recall\nUsed vehicle unit volume and gross profit in 2016 were adversely impacted by the Takata airbag inflator recall, the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. automotive history. This recall has been disruptive to our business, as the vehicle inventory subject to this recall has been placed on a retail sales-hold by several manufacturers until parts become available to replace the defective airbag inflators. Certain manufacturers provide financial support for select vehicles that are on a retail sales-hold as a result of the recall, which serves to reduce our costs associated with those vehicles. We cannot predict when or how many replacement parts will become available, the number of additional affected vehicles that we will\nacquire through trade-ins, or the amount of financial support we will receive from the manufacturers of such vehicles in the future, and this recall may continue to adversely impact our business.\nInventory Management\nOur new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor our vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and seasonal sales trends.\nWe have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 75,117 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 80,442 units at December 31, 2015. See New Vehicle Inventories\u201d below for more information.\nWe recondition the majority of used vehicles acquired for retail sale in our parts and service departments and capitalize the related costs to the used vehicle inventory. Used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are generally liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $4.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nParts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, manufacturer return policies, and industry trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $3.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $3.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill for our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nUnder accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting units under the two-step goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment as of April 30, 2016, and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $252.1 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $558.2 million related to the Import reporting unit, $697.4 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit, and $3.6 million in Corporate and other.\u201d\nOther Intangible Assets\nOur principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nOur franchise rights, which related to 69 stores and totaled $546.4 million at April 30, 2016, are evaluated for impairment on a franchise-by-franchise basis annually. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of franchise rights impairment to determine whether it was necessary to perform a\nquantitative impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of franchise rights impairment as of April 30, 2016. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that we should perform a quantitative test for certain franchise rights; however, no impairment charges resulted from these quantitative tests.\nThe quantitative impairment test for franchise rights requires the comparison of the franchise rights' estimated fair value to carrying value by store. Fair values of rights under franchise agreements are estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting expected future cash flows of the store. The forecasted cash flows contain inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates, margins, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and cost of capital, for which we utilize certain market participant-based assumptions, using third-party industry projections, economic projections, and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable. If, hypothetically, the fair value of each of the franchise rights quantitatively tested had been determined to be 10% lower as of the valuation date, no impairment charge would have resulted. The effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value estimates is not intended to provide a sensitivity analysis of every potential outcome.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more-likely-than-not a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses.\nWhen evaluating potential impairment of long-lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held and used were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group's carrying amount exceeds the asset group's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset.\nWhen property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long-lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long-lived asset's or disposal group's carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale\u201d criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets.\nWe had assets held for sale in continuing operations of $41.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $47.1 million at December 31, 2015, and assets held for sale in discontinued operations of $15.7 million at December 31, 2016, and $22.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe fair value measurements for our property and equipment and assets held for sale are based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurement valuation process and impairment charges that were recorded during 2016 and 2015. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our\nproperty and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets.\nChargeback Liability\nRevenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for the placement of: (i) loans and leases with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts with third-party providers, and (iii) other vehicle protection products with third-party providers. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however, in certain cases, we also participate in the future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements with the issuers of those contracts, which is recognized as earned.\nWe may be charged back for commissions related to financing, vehicle service contracts, or other vehicle protection products in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by customers ( chargebacks\u201d). However, our exposure to loss generally is limited to the commissions that we receive. These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks.\nWe estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $116.8 million at December 31, 2016, and $97.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nChargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle service contracts and other vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in an adjustment to our estimated liability for chargebacks. The increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to increases in vehicle unit volume and product penetration in recent years, product mix, and an overall increase in the cancellation rates of finance and insurance products. Our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. A 10% change in our estimated cancellation rates would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2016, by approximately $11.5 million.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nUnder our self-insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims-handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers' compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third-party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. Our results could be adversely impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self-insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self-insurance liabilities totaled $75.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $74.8 million at December 31, 2015. Our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs.\nAccounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards prescribe a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.\nReported Operating Data Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

on a same store basis. The difference between reported amounts and same store amounts in the above tables of $967.4 million, $390.0 million, and $86.9 million in new vehicle revenue and $45.6 million, $16.9 million, and $4.1 million in new vehicle gross profit for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, is related to acquisition and divestiture activity.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSame store new vehicle revenue decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in revenue PVR. The decrease in same store unit volume was primarily due to certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive programs, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\nSame store revenue PVR during 2016 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for vehicles in all three segments, as well as lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store new vehicle revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, as a result of increases in same store unit volume and revenue PVR. The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to replacement demand and improved\nmarket conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and confidence. New product offerings from certain automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted same store unit volume.\nSame store revenue PVR during 2015 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for Domestic and Import vehicles, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price for Premium Luxury vehicles. Same store revenue PVR also benefited from a shift in mix away from Import vehicles, which have relatively lower average selling prices. In addition, same store revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases in gross profit PVR for vehicles at our Premium Luxury and Import stores due to increased inventory levels and changes in manufacturer incentive programs, as well as a competitive automotive retail environment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced greater compression in our new vehicle gross profit PVR due to these factors.\nNet New Vehicle Inventory Carrying Benefit\nThe following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit, consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory). Floorplan assistance is accounted for as a component of new vehicle gross profit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floorplan assistance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New vehicle floorplan interest expense\n</td> <td>(71.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in floorplan interest expense, partially offset by an increase in floorplan assistance. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year, which was due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, and higher interest rates. Floorplan assistance increased due to an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit and benefited from the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in floorplan assistance, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year.\nNew Vehicle Inventories\nOur new vehicle inventories were $2.8 billion or 61 days supply at December 31, 2016, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.9 billion or 68 days supply at December 31, 2015. We had 75,117 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 80,442 units at December 31, 2015. The decrease in new vehicle inventory days supply at December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, is primarily due to steps we have taken to align our inventory in response to the current market conditions.\nUsed Vehicle\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The decrease in same store unit volume was driven by a competitive automotive retail environment, as well as a decrease in trade-in volume associated with the decrease in new vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles. Same store unit volume was also\nadversely impacted by manufacturer safety recalls, including the Takata airbag inflator recall, and the application of our previous open safety recall policy. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, we modified our recall policy to permit the retail sale of certain used vehicles with an open recall, where parts are not available to complete the recall and full disclosure is made to the purchaser.\nSame store revenue PVR benefited from an increase in the average selling price of used vehicles for all three segments, and a shift in mix toward Premium Luxury vehicles and the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, both of which have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to margin pressure resulting from new vehicle gross profit PVR compression during the same period combined with the application of our previous open safety recall policy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store retail used vehicle revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increases in same store unit volume and revenue PVR. Same store unit volume was driven by an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, as well as an increase in trade-in volume associated with new vehicle sales.\nSame store revenue PVR benefited from an increase in the average selling price of used vehicles at our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury stores, and an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to compressed gross profit PVRs for certified pre-owned vehicles, particularly in our Premium Luxury segment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced greater compression in our used vehicle gross profit PVR, which was largely a result of gross profit PVR compression for new vehicles during the same period.\nUsed Vehicle Inventories\nUsed vehicle inventories were $559.1 million or 44 days supply at December 31, 2016, compared to $539.7 million or 43 days supply at December 31, 2015.

SG&A expenses in 2016 were also negatively impacted by an increase in hail-related losses of $7.5 million as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable expenses as a result of the decrease in unit volume. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses increased to 70.9% in 2016 from 69.4% in 2015, primarily due to gross profit pressure from the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs discussed above under Market Conditions\u201d and the application of our previous open safety recall policy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSG&A expenses increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a volume-driven increase in variable compensation expense, an increase in store and corporate overhead expenses due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2015, and an increase in advertising expenditures. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased slightly to 69.4% in 2015 from 69.6% in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense as a percentage of total gross profit.\nOther Income, Net (included in Operating Income)\nDuring 2016, we recognized net gains of $61.8 million related to the divestiture of five Domestic stores and nine Import stores, a gain of $14.4 million in connection with a legal settlement related to the Volkswagen diesel emissions litigation, and a gain of $5.5 million related to payments we received to waive certain franchise protest rights. These net gains were partially offset by non-cash property impairments of $14.0 million.\nDuring 2015, we recognized gains related to property dispositions of $16.7 million and the divestiture of three Import stores of $7.4 million. These gains were partially offset by non-cash property impairments of $6.1 million.\nDuring 2014, we recognized a gain related to the divestiture of two Import stores of $4.4 million, a gain related to a legal settlement of $4.0 million, and a net gain related to business/property dispositions of $8.1 million, primarily related to the divestiture of our customer lead distribution business.\nFranchise Rights Impairment\nDuring 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $15.4 million associated with franchise rights recorded at our Volkswagen stores. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNon-Operating Income (Expenses)\nFloorplan Interest Expense\nFloorplan interest expense was $76.5 million in 2016, $58.3 million in 2015, and $53.3 million in 2014. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $18.2 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, is the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances during the year, which was due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, and higher interest rates. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $5.0 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances during the year.\nOther Interest Expense\nOther interest expense was $115.5 million in 2016, $90.9 million in 2015, and $86.7 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense of $24.6 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, was driven by higher average debt balances resulting primarily from share repurchases and acquisitions. The increase in interest expense of $4.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase of $8.3 million resulting from the September 2015 issuance of our 3.35% Senior Notes due 2021 and 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025. This increase was partially offset by decreases in interest expense of $3.3 million due to lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing in December 2014 and our commercial paper program established in May 2015, and $0.6 million resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our mortgage facility.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nWe expensed $1.6 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to our credit facility refinancing transaction. This expense included $0.4 million for the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix.\nOur effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2016. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate was 38.6% in 2015 and was 38.5% in 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated prior to January 1, 2014. Results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge and carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that were closed prior to January 1, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and secured used vehicle floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAvailable Liquidity Resources\nWe had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,058.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,463.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured used floorplan facilities(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As limited by the maximum consolidated leverage ratio in our credit agreement. \n (2) At December 31, 2016, we had $44.1 million of letters of credit outstanding. In addition, we use the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under the commercial paper program. We had $942.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2016, which in effect reduced the available liquidity under our revolving credit facility to $813.9 million. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (3) Based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance relating to insurance matters. At December 31, 2016, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $102.7 million, including the $44.1 million of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.\nIn February 2016, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that enables us to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, units, and guarantees of debt securities.\nCapital Allocation\nOur capital allocation strategy is focused on maximizing stockholder returns. We invest capital in our business to maintain and upgrade our existing facilities and to build new facilities, as well as for other strategic and technology initiatives, including the next phase of our brand extension strategy discussed above under Strategic Initiatives.\u201d We also deploy capital opportunistically to repurchase our common stock and/or debt or to complete dealership acquisitions and/or build facilities for newly awarded franchises. Our capital allocation decisions will be based on factors such as the expected rate of return on our investment, the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the market price of our debt, the potential impact on our capital structure, our ability to complete dealership acquisitions that meet our market and vehicle brand criteria and return on investment threshold, and limitations set forth in our debt agreements.\nShare Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors from time to time authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a certain monetary limit. A summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate purchase price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average purchase price per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, $298.6 million remained available under our stock repurchase limit most recently authorized by our Board of Directors.\nThe decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our\n3.75x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy-outs (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes accrued construction in progress and excludes property associated with capital leases entered into during the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nThe following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in business acquisitions, net(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(410.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(321.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(205.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash received from business divestitures, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Excludes capital leases and deferred purchase price commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, we purchased 20 stores located in Texas, New York, Colorado, California, and Maryland, which include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Sprinter, Jaguar, Land Rover, and BMW franchises. We also purchased a collision center in Illinois in 2016. We purchased 22 stores in 2015 and five stores in 2014.\nDuring 2016, we divested five Domestic stores and nine Import stores. In 2015, we divested three Import stores. In 2014, we divested two Import stores and our customer lead distribution business, which was reported in the Corporate and other\u201d category of our segment information.\nWe regularly review our store portfolio and may divest stores opportunistically. Since January 1, 2015, we have received $241.2 million of proceeds related to asset sales, including business and real estate divestitures. We have utilized those proceeds, and expect to utilize proceeds from future asset sales, to fund our capital investments and strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes.\nCash Dividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table sets forth our non-vehicle long-term debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.75% Senior Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.5% Senior Notes due 2020\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.35% Senior Notes due 2021\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.5% Senior Notes due 2025\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility due 2019\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage facility(1)\n</td> <td>153.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases and other debt\n</td> <td>136.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1,789.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,770.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current maturities\n</td> <td>(167.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net of current maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,611.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,745.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.6 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $143.9 million due November 2017.  At December 31, 2016, we had $942.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.26% and a weighted-average remaining term of 24 days.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and commercial paper.\nRestrictions and Covenants\nOur credit agreement, the indentures for our senior unsecured notes, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities.\nUnder our credit agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non-vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non-vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Under our credit agreement, the maximum leverage ratio is 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio is 70.0%. In calculating our leverage and capitalization ratios, we are not required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million). In addition, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are permitted to add back to shareholders' equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long-lived asset impairment charges subsequent to September 30, 2014 plus $1.53 billion. The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our credit agreement, which we filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 4, 2014.\nThe indentures for our senior unsecured notes contain certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our credit agreement, at December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\u2264 3.75x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.70x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization ratio\n</td> <td>\u2264 70.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVehicle Floorplan Payable\nThe components of vehicle floorplan payable are as follows:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicle floorplan payable - trade\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,308.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,565.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicle floorplan payable - non-trade\n</td> <td>1,540.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,161.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Vehicle floorplan payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,727.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our vehicle floorplan payable.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>516.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(489.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(509.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(376.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(102.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts-in-transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and finance and insurance products, collections from customers for the sale of parts and services, and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable-trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable-trade, purchases of parts inventory, personnel-related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, and was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by a decrease in earnings.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, and was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements and an increase in earnings.\nDuring 2014, we paid $7.2 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. Cash flows from operating activities in 2014 reflect $1.2 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to this refinancing transaction. In addition, we charged to expense $0.4 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities in 2014, discussed below, reflect $6.0 million of debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, and other transactions.\nWe will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, partially offset by an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet cash used in investing activities increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in property and equipment purchases, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade, and proceeds from stock option exercises.\n2016 compared to 2015\nUnder our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, during 2016, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $497.0 million (average purchase price per share of $47.30). Additionally, 38,906 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2016 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $235.1 million (average purchase price per share of $60.49). Additionally, 36,712 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2015 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.\nDuring 2015, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.35% Senior Notes due 2021 and $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025. Cash flows from financing activities in 2015 reflect cash payments of $6.4 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt arrangements.\nCash flows from financing activities include changes in commercial paper notes outstanding totaling net proceeds of $342.5 million during 2016 and $599.5 million during 2015.\nDuring 2016, we borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid $1.3 billion under our revolving credit facility. During 2015, we borrowed $1.4 billion and repaid $2.5 billion under our revolving credit facility, for net repayments of $1.1 billion.\nCash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaling net proceeds of $153.8 million during 2016 compared to net repayments of $13.3 million in 2015.\nDuring 2016, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nDuring 2014, we amended and restated our existing unsecured credit agreement and replaced our $500.0 million term loan facility and $1.2 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. The indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from our amended credit agreement. Cash flows from financing activities in 2014 also reflect cash payments of $6.0 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement. During 2014, we borrowed $2.8 billion and repaid $2.0 billion under our revolving credit facilities, for net borrowings of $810.0 million.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during 2015, as compared to 2014, were impacted primarily by the debt activity that occurred in 2015 as compared to 2014, described above, and a decrease in repurchases of common stock.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2016. The amounts presented are based upon, among other things, the terms of any relevant agreements. Future events that may occur related to the following payment obligations could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1\nYear\n(2017)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n(2018 and\n2019)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n(2020 and\n2021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5\nYears\n(2022 and\nthereafter)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including capital leases (Note 7)(1)(2)\n</td> <td>1,789.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>656.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper (Note 7)(1)\n</td> <td>942.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(3)\n</td> <td>392.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease and other commitments (Note 8)(1)(4)\n</td> <td>433.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)(1)\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation obligations(5)\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated chargeback liability (Note 18)(1)(6)\n</td> <td>116.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated self-insurance obligations (Note 6)(1)(7)\n</td> <td>75.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(8)\n</td> <td>113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,789.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,291.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>751.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>819.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (2) Amounts for long-term debt obligations reflect principal payments and are not reduced for unamortized debt discounts of $2.6 million or debt issuance costs of $8.2 million. \n (3) Primarily represents scheduled fixed interest payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes, mortgage facility, and capital leases. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and commercial paper are excluded due to the short-term nature of these facilities. \n (4) Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2016, these charges totaled approximately $24 million. Additionally, operating leases that are on a month-to-month basis are not included. \n (5) Due to uncertainty regarding timing of payments expected beyond one year, long-term obligations for deferred compensation arrangements have been classified in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column. \n (6) Our estimated chargeback obligations do not have scheduled maturities, however, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. \n (7) Our estimated self-insurance obligations are based on management estimates and actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. \n (8) Primarily represents purchase orders and contracts in connection with information technology and communication systems and real estate construction projects.  We expect that the amounts above will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit agreement. In the case of payments due upon the maturity of our debt instruments, we currently expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2016, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash\ndeposits totaled $102.7 million, of which $44.1 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit.\nAs further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including without limitation statements regarding our brand extension strategy, open safety recalls, pending or planned acquisitions, strategic initiatives, expected future investments in our business, and our expectations for the future performance of our business and the automotive retail industry, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements that describe our objectives, plans or goals are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Words such as anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d goal,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d continue,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d could,\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The automotive retail industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict.  \u2022Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the incentive, marketing, and other programs of vehicle manufacturers.\n \u2022 We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. \n \u2022 If we are not able to maintain and enhance our retail brands and reputation or to attract consumers to our own digital channels, or if events occur that damage our retail brands, reputation, or sales channels, our business and financial results may be harmed. We are investing significantly in the next phase of our brand extension strategy, and if our strategic initiatives are not successful, we will have incurred significant expenses without the benefit of improved financial results. \n \u2022 New laws, regulations, or governmental policies regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards, or changes to existing standards, may affect vehicle manufacturers' ability to produce cost-effective vehicles or vehicles that consumers demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, and prospects. \n \u2022 Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. \n \u2022 We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. \n \u2022 We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. \n \u2022 Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in purported violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer. \n \u2022 A failure of our information systems or any security breach or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n \u2022 Our debt agreements contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. \n \u2022 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and commercial paper program that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. \n \u2022 Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders' equity. \n \u2022 Our largest stockholders, as a result of their ownership stakes in us, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders or Board of Directors. In addition, future share repurchases and fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders could impact the volume of trading, liquidity, and market price of our common stock.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nExcept to the extent that differences among reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis.\nOverview\nAutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 371 new vehicle franchises from 260 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 35 different new vehicle brands. The core brands of new vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 94% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2016, are manufactured by Toyota (including Lexus), Ford, Honda, General Motors, FCA US, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen (including Audi and Porsche).\nWe offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service,\u201d which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses, and automotive finance and insurance\u201d products, which include vehicle service and other protection products, as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had three reportable segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and FCA US. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus, and Audi. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue, and approximately 19% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 23% of our total revenue, and approximately 10% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 20% of total revenue, contributed approximately 70% of our gross profit.\nMarket Conditions\nFull-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales were 17.5 million in 2016, as compared to 17.5 million in 2015 and 16.5 million in 2014. U.S. industry new vehicle unit retail sales were down 1% as compared to the prior year. We expect that full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales in 2017 will remain above 17 million. However, actual sales may materially differ. Based on industry data, vehicle leasing is at a historically-high level. To the extent that vehicle manufacturers reduce their support for leasing programs, U.S. industry and our new vehicle unit retail sales could be adversely impacted.\nOur new vehicle unit volume and new vehicle gross profit on a per vehicle retailed ( PVR\u201d) basis were adversely impacted by certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive programs, which are based upon store-level growth targets established by those manufacturers, and which result in multi-tier pricing. If those manufacturers continue to use such incentive programs or if other manufacturers adopt similar incentive programs, our operating results could continue to be adversely impacted.\nThe number of recent-model-year vehicles in operation is growing due to increases in the annual rate of new vehicle sales in the United States since 2009. The growth in that portion of our service base, together with our customer retention efforts, has benefited the customer-pay service and warranty components of our parts and service business, and we believe that it will continue to benefit those components for the next several years. While the number of older vehicles in operation\nhas declined in recent years and is expected to continue to decline over the next few years, we believe that overall our parts and service business will benefit from the mix shift in our service base toward newer vehicles.\nResults of Operations\nWe had net income from continuing operations of $431.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.16 in 2016, as compared to net income from continuing operations of $443.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.90 in 2015, and net income from continuing operations of $419.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.53 in 2014.\nOur retail new vehicle unit sales were down slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015. The disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs discussed above under Market Conditions\u201d had a negative impact on our new vehicle unit volume and gross profit PVR. New vehicle gross profit PVR compression was partially offset by continued strength in finance and insurance gross profit PVR. Used vehicle unit volume and gross profit were adversely impacted by the Takata airbag inflator recall discussed below. Our total gross profit for 2016 increased 2%, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015 and an increase in parts and service gross profit.\nNet income from continuing operations benefited from net after-tax gains related to business/property dispositions (net of property impairments) of $30.1 million in 2016, $11.1 million in 2015, and $7.7 million in 2014, as well as net after-tax gains related to legal settlements of $8.9 million in 2016 and $2.5 million in 2014. See Other Income, Net\u201d below.\nStrategic Initiatives\nIn 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand from coast to coast. During 2015, that branding effort was extended to AutoNation Express and the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan. We recently announced the next phase of our comprehensive, customer-focused brand extension strategy, which includes:\n \u2022 AutoNation USA stand-alone used vehicle sales and service centers, with 25 potential sites identified, five of which are expected to open in 2017, \n \u2022 AutoNation branded parts and accessories, the launch of which began in the third quarter of 2016, and which will be expanded over the next several years, \n \u2022 the expansion of AutoNation branded collision centers, which includes the unification of our collision centers under the AutoNation retail brand and plans to open or acquire at least 18 new collision centers over the next several years, and \n \u2022 the expansion of AutoNation branded automotive auctions, which, as announced in October 2016, includes plans to open four additional automotive auctions by the end of 2018.  We expect that these initiatives will expand and strengthen the AutoNation retail brand, improve the customer experience, provide new growth opportunities, and enable us to expand our footprint in our core and other markets. We expect that our investments in this phase of our brand extension roll-out, which may exceed $500 million in the aggregate, will continue for the next several years. The roll-out of these strategic initiatives may be impacted by a number of variables, including customer adoption, market conditions, and our ability to identify, acquire, and build out suitable locations in a timely manner. See Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with our brand extension strategy, we also launched a one price used vehicle sales model during the second half of 2016. The one price model is planned to be fully implemented in all of our stores by the end of the second quarter of 2017.\nTakata Airbag Inflator Recall\nUsed vehicle unit volume and gross profit in 2016 were adversely impacted by the Takata airbag inflator recall, the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. automotive history. This recall has been disruptive to our business, as the vehicle inventory subject to this recall has been placed on a retail sales-hold by several manufacturers until parts become available to replace the defective airbag inflators. Certain manufacturers provide financial support for select vehicles that are on a retail sales-hold as a result of the recall, which serves to reduce our costs associated with those vehicles. We cannot predict when or how many replacement parts will become available, the number of additional affected vehicles that we will\nacquire through trade-ins, or the amount of financial support we will receive from the manufacturers of such vehicles in the future, and this recall may continue to adversely impact our business.\nInventory Management\nOur new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor our vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and seasonal sales trends.\nWe have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 75,117 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 80,442 units at December 31, 2015. See New Vehicle Inventories\u201d below for more information.\nWe recondition the majority of used vehicles acquired for retail sale in our parts and service departments and capitalize the related costs to the used vehicle inventory. Used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are generally liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $4.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nParts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, manufacturer return policies, and industry trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $3.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $3.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill for our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nUnder accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting units under the two-step goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment as of April 30, 2016, and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $252.1 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $558.2 million related to the Import reporting unit, $697.4 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit, and $3.6 million in Corporate and other.\u201d\nOther Intangible Assets\nOur principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nOur franchise rights, which related to 69 stores and totaled $546.4 million at April 30, 2016, are evaluated for impairment on a franchise-by-franchise basis annually. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of franchise rights impairment to determine whether it was necessary to perform a\nquantitative impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of franchise rights impairment as of April 30, 2016. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that we should perform a quantitative test for certain franchise rights; however, no impairment charges resulted from these quantitative tests.\nThe quantitative impairment test for franchise rights requires the comparison of the franchise rights' estimated fair value to carrying value by store. Fair values of rights under franchise agreements are estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting expected future cash flows of the store. The forecasted cash flows contain inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates, margins, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and cost of capital, for which we utilize certain market participant-based assumptions, using third-party industry projections, economic projections, and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable. If, hypothetically, the fair value of each of the franchise rights quantitatively tested had been determined to be 10% lower as of the valuation date, no impairment charge would have resulted. The effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value estimates is not intended to provide a sensitivity analysis of every potential outcome.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more-likely-than-not a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses.\nWhen evaluating potential impairment of long-lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held and used were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group's carrying amount exceeds the asset group's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset.\nWhen property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long-lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long-lived asset's or disposal group's carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale\u201d criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets.\nWe had assets held for sale in continuing operations of $41.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $47.1 million at December 31, 2015, and assets held for sale in discontinued operations of $15.7 million at December 31, 2016, and $22.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe fair value measurements for our property and equipment and assets held for sale are based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurement valuation process and impairment charges that were recorded during 2016 and 2015. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our\nproperty and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets.\nChargeback Liability\nRevenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for the placement of: (i) loans and leases with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts with third-party providers, and (iii) other vehicle protection products with third-party providers. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however, in certain cases, we also participate in the future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements with the issuers of those contracts, which is recognized as earned.\nWe may be charged back for commissions related to financing, vehicle service contracts, or other vehicle protection products in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by customers ( chargebacks\u201d). However, our exposure to loss generally is limited to the commissions that we receive. These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks.\nWe estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $116.8 million at December 31, 2016, and $97.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nChargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle service contracts and other vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in an adjustment to our estimated liability for chargebacks. The increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to increases in vehicle unit volume and product penetration in recent years, product mix, and an overall increase in the cancellation rates of finance and insurance products. Our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. A 10% change in our estimated cancellation rates would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2016, by approximately $11.5 million.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nUnder our self-insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims-handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers' compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third-party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. Our results could be adversely impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self-insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self-insurance liabilities totaled $75.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $74.8 million at December 31, 2015. Our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs.\nAccounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards prescribe a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.\nReported Operating Data \n\nSame Store Operating Data\nWe have presented below our operating results on a same store basis to reflect our internal performance. The Same Store\u201d amounts presented below include the results of our stores for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison, commencing with the first full month in which the store was owned by us. For example, the results for a store acquired in February 2015 would be included only in our same store comparison of 2016 to 2015, not in our same store comparison of 2015 to 2014. Therefore, the amounts presented in the year 2015 column that is being compared to the year 2016 column may differ from the amounts presented in the year 2015 column that is being compared to the year 2014 column.\n\n\nNew Vehicle\n\n\nThe following discussion of new vehicles is on a same store basis. The difference between reported amounts and same store amounts in the above tables of $967.4 million, $390.0 million, and $86.9 million in new vehicle revenue and $45.6 million, $16.9 million, and $4.1 million in new vehicle gross profit for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, is related to acquisition and divestiture activity.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSame store new vehicle revenue decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in revenue PVR. The decrease in same store unit volume was primarily due to certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive programs, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\nSame store revenue PVR during 2016 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for vehicles in all three segments, as well as lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store new vehicle revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, as a result of increases in same store unit volume and revenue PVR. The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to replacement demand and improved\nmarket conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and confidence. New product offerings from certain automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted same store unit volume.\nSame store revenue PVR during 2015 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for Domestic and Import vehicles, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price for Premium Luxury vehicles. Same store revenue PVR also benefited from a shift in mix away from Import vehicles, which have relatively lower average selling prices. In addition, same store revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases in gross profit PVR for vehicles at our Premium Luxury and Import stores due to increased inventory levels and changes in manufacturer incentive programs, as well as a competitive automotive retail environment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced greater compression in our new vehicle gross profit PVR due to these factors.\nNet New Vehicle Inventory Carrying Benefit\nThe following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit, consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory). Floorplan assistance is accounted for as a component of new vehicle gross profit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in floorplan interest expense, partially offset by an increase in floorplan assistance. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year, which was due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, and higher interest rates. Floorplan assistance increased due to an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit and benefited from the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in floorplan assistance, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year.\nNew Vehicle Inventories\nOur new vehicle inventories were $2.8 billion or 61 days supply at December 31, 2016, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.9 billion or 68 days supply at December 31, 2015. We had 75,117 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 80,442 units at December 31, 2015. The decrease in new vehicle inventory days supply at December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, is primarily due to steps we have taken to align our inventory in response to the current market conditions.\nUsed Vehicle\n\n\nThe following discussion of used vehicles is on a same store basis. The difference between reported amounts and same store amounts in the above tables of $358.2 million, $169.2 million, and $31.1 million in retail used vehicle revenue and $23.4 million, $12.5 million, and $3.6 million in retail used vehicle gross profit for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, is related to acquisition and divestiture activity.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSame store retail used vehicle revenue decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in revenue PVR. The decrease in same store unit volume was driven by a competitive automotive retail environment, as well as a decrease in trade-in volume associated with the decrease in new vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles. Same store unit volume was also\nadversely impacted by manufacturer safety recalls, including the Takata airbag inflator recall, and the application of our previous open safety recall policy. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, we modified our recall policy to permit the retail sale of certain used vehicles with an open recall, where parts are not available to complete the recall and full disclosure is made to the purchaser.\nSame store revenue PVR benefited from an increase in the average selling price of used vehicles for all three segments, and a shift in mix toward Premium Luxury vehicles and the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, both of which have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to margin pressure resulting from new vehicle gross profit PVR compression during the same period combined with the application of our previous open safety recall policy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store retail used vehicle revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increases in same store unit volume and revenue PVR. Same store unit volume was driven by an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, as well as an increase in trade-in volume associated with new vehicle sales.\nSame store revenue PVR benefited from an increase in the average selling price of used vehicles at our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury stores, and an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices.\nSame store gross profit PVR decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to compressed gross profit PVRs for certified pre-owned vehicles, particularly in our Premium Luxury segment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced greater compression in our used vehicle gross profit PVR, which was largely a result of gross profit PVR compression for new vehicles during the same period.\nUsed Vehicle Inventories\nUsed vehicle inventories were $559.1 million or 44 days supply at December 31, 2016, compared to $539.7 million or 43 days supply at December 31, 2015. We had 36,678 units in used vehicle inventory at December 31, 2016, and 36,299 units at December 31, 2015.\nParts & Service\n\n\nParts and service revenue is primarily derived from vehicle repairs paid directly by customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranty programs, as well as from wholesale parts sales and collision businesses.\nThe following discussion of parts and service is on a same store basis. The difference between reported amounts and same store amounts in the above tables of $267.2 million, $116.6 million, and $29.4 million in parts and service revenue and $110.4 million, $51.5 million, and $14.1 million in parts and service gross profit for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, is related to acquisition and divestiture activity.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSame store parts and service gross profit increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to increases in gross profit associated with customer-pay service of $28.8 million and warranty of $23.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale of $8.1 million.\nCustomer-pay service gross profit benefited from improved operational execution and margin performance, as well as increased volume due to the increase in units in operation in our primary service base. Warranty gross profit benefited from an increase in volume, driven by the increase in units in operation in our primary service base. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale was adversely impacted by the decrease in new and used vehicle unit volume.\nSee Strategic Initiatives\u201d above for a discussion of our brand extension strategy, which includes the launch of AutoNation USA stand-alone used vehicles sales and service centers, the launch of AutoNation branded parts and accessories, and the expansion of AutoNation branded collision centers.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store parts and service gross profit increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in gross profit associated with customer-pay service of $33.9 million, warranty of $28.1 million, the preparation of vehicles for sale of $22.6 million, and collision business of $12.5 million.\nCustomer-pay service gross profit benefited from improved operational execution and margin performance, as well as increased volume due to the increase in units in operation in our primary service base. Warranty gross profit also benefited from an increase in volume, driven by the increase in units in operation in our primary service base, as well as elevated\nmanufacturer recall activity. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale benefited from higher new and used vehicle unit volume. Gross profit associated with our collision business benefited from increased volume referred by automotive insurance providers, as well as an increase in the average repair value and improved customer retention efforts.\nFinance and Insurance\n\n\nRevenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for the placement of: (i) loans and leases with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts with third-party providers, and (iii) other vehicle protection products with third-party providers. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however, in certain cases, we also participate in the future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements with the issuers of those contracts, which is recognized as earned.\nThe following discussion of finance and insurance is on a same store basis. The difference between reported amounts and same store amounts in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit in the above tables of $60.0 million, $27.3 million, and $5.2 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively, is related to acquisition and divestiture activity.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSame store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, due to the decrease in new and used vehicle unit volume, partially offset by an increase in same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR.\nSame store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR increased primarily due to an increase in profit on vehicle service contracts as a result of the sale in our Domestic and Import stores of the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan, which was rolled out during the second half of 2015. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR also benefited from increases in product penetration and amounts financed per transaction.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSame store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increases in same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR and new and used vehicle unit volume.\nSame store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR benefited from increases in product penetration, profit on vehicle service contracts, amounts financed per transaction, and the number of customers financing vehicles through our stores.\nSegment Results\nIn the following table of financial data, revenue and segment income of our reportable segments are reconciled to consolidated revenue and consolidated operating income, respectively.\n\nDomestic\nThe Domestic segment operating results included the following:\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nDomestic revenue increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to increases in new and used vehicle unit volume and new and used vehicle revenue PVR. New and used vehicle unit volume benefited from the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015. New vehicle revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices. Used vehicle revenue PVR benefited from the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices. Domestic revenue was adversely impacted by the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment.\nDomestic segment income decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, due in part to an increase in SG&A expenses largely due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015. Domestic segment income was also adversely impacted by a decrease in new vehicle gross profit primarily due to the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment, a decrease in used vehicle gross profit due to the competitive automotive retail environment and the application of our previous open safety recall policy, and an increase in floorplan interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Domestic segment income benefited from increases in parts and service gross profit and finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nDomestic revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in new and used vehicle unit volume and new and used vehicle revenue PVR. The increase in new vehicle unit volume was due in part to replacement demand and improved market conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and improved consumer confidence as compared to the prior year. New product offerings from certain automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted new vehicle unit volume. New vehicle revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices. The increase in used vehicle unit volume was primarily due to an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, as well as an increase in trade-in volume associated with new vehicle sales. Used vehicle revenue PVR benefited from the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices.\nDomestic segment income increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit, which benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR and higher vehicle unit volume. Domestic segment income also benefited from an increase in parts and service gross profit. Increases in Domestic segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses.\nImport\nThe Import segment operating results included the following:\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nImport revenue decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a decrease in new vehicle unit volume primarily due to the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment, and a decrease in used vehicle unit volume due to the more competitive automotive retail environment and the application of our previous open safety recall policy. Import revenue benefited from the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015.\nImport segment income decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a decrease in new vehicle gross profit primarily due to the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs described above, which resulted in a more competitive automotive retail environment, and a decrease in used vehicle gross profit due to the competitive automotive retail environment and the application of our previous open safety recall policy. Import segment income also was adversely impacted by a decrease in finance and insurance gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in variable expenses and an increase in parts and service gross profit.\n2015 compared to 2014\nImport revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in new and used vehicle unit volume and new and used vehicle revenue PVR. The increase in new vehicle unit volume was primarily due to replacement demand and improved market conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and confidence as compared to the prior year. New product offerings from certain automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted new vehicle unit volume. New vehicle revenue PVR benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix toward larger vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles, that have relatively higher average selling prices. The increase in used vehicle unit volume was primarily due to an increase in trade-in volume associated with new vehicle sales, as well as an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles. Used vehicle revenue PVR benefited from the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices. Import revenue also benefited from an increase in parts and service revenue.\nImport segment income increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in parts and service gross profit and an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit, which benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR and higher vehicle unit volume. Increases in Import segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses and decreases in both new and used vehicle gross profit due to the competitive automotive retail environment.\nPremium Luxury\nThe Premium Luxury segment operating results included the following:\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nPremium Luxury revenue increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle and parts and service revenue due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by a decrease in new vehicle revenue due to a decrease in new vehicle unit volume.\nPremium Luxury segment income decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in SG&A expenses largely due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015 and a decrease in new and used vehicle gross profit due to the competitive automotive retail environment and the application of our previous open safety recall policy. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in parts and service gross profit due to the acquisitions mentioned above.\n2015 compared to 2014\nPremium Luxury revenue increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in new and used vehicle unit volume and used vehicle revenue PVR. The increase in new vehicle unit volume was due in part to replacement demand and improved market conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and confidence. New product offerings from certain automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted new vehicle unit volume. The increase in used vehicle unit volume was primarily due to an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, as well as an increase in trade-in volume associated with new vehicle sales. Used vehicle revenue PVR benefited from the increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices. New and used vehicle unit volume also benefited from the acquisitions we completed during 2015.\nPremium Luxury segment income increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in parts and service gross profit and an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit, which benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit PVR and higher vehicle unit volume. Premium Luxury segment income also benefited from the acquisitions we completed during 2015. Increases in Premium Luxury segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses and decreases in new and used vehicle gross profit PVR due to increased inventory levels and changes in manufacturer incentive programs, as well as a competitive automotive retail environment.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses consist primarily of compensation, including store and corporate salaries, commissions, and incentive-based compensation, as well as advertising (net of reimbursement-based manufacturer advertising rebates), and store and corporate overhead expenses, which include occupancy costs, legal, accounting, and professional services, and general corporate expenses. The following table presents the major components of our SG&A.\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nSG&A expenses increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in 2016. SG&A expenses in 2016 were also negatively impacted by an increase in hail-related losses of $7.5 million as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable expenses as a result of the decrease in unit volume. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses increased to 70.9% in 2016 from 69.4% in 2015, primarily due to gross profit pressure from the disruptive manufacturer marketing and sales incentive programs discussed above under Market Conditions\u201d and the application of our previous open safety recall policy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSG&A expenses increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a volume-driven increase in variable compensation expense, an increase in store and corporate overhead expenses due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2015, and an increase in advertising expenditures. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased slightly to 69.4% in 2015 from 69.6% in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense as a percentage of total gross profit.\nOther Income, Net (included in Operating Income)\nDuring 2016, we recognized net gains of $61.8 million related to the divestiture of five Domestic stores and nine Import stores, a gain of $14.4 million in connection with a legal settlement related to the Volkswagen diesel emissions litigation, and a gain of $5.5 million related to payments we received to waive certain franchise protest rights. These net gains were partially offset by non-cash property impairments of $14.0 million.\nDuring 2015, we recognized gains related to property dispositions of $16.7 million and the divestiture of three Import stores of $7.4 million. These gains were partially offset by non-cash property impairments of $6.1 million.\nDuring 2014, we recognized a gain related to the divestiture of two Import stores of $4.4 million, a gain related to a legal settlement of $4.0 million, and a net gain related to business/property dispositions of $8.1 million, primarily related to the divestiture of our customer lead distribution business.\nFranchise Rights Impairment\nDuring 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $15.4 million associated with franchise rights recorded at our Volkswagen stores. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNon-Operating Income (Expenses)\nFloorplan Interest Expense\nFloorplan interest expense was $76.5 million in 2016, $58.3 million in 2015, and $53.3 million in 2014. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $18.2 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, is the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances during the year, which was due in part to the acquisitions we completed in 2016 and 2015, and higher interest rates. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $5.0 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances during the year.\nOther Interest Expense\nOther interest expense was $115.5 million in 2016, $90.9 million in 2015, and $86.7 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense of $24.6 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, was driven by higher average debt balances resulting primarily from share repurchases and acquisitions. The increase in interest expense of $4.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase of $8.3 million resulting from the September 2015 issuance of our 3.35% Senior Notes due 2021 and 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025. This increase was partially offset by decreases in interest expense of $3.3 million due to lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing in December 2014 and our commercial paper program established in May 2015, and $0.6 million resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our mortgage facility.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nWe expensed $1.6 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to our credit facility refinancing transaction. This expense included $0.4 million for the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix.\nOur effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2016. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate was 38.6% in 2015 and was 38.5% in 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated prior to January 1, 2014. Results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge and carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that were closed prior to January 1, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and secured used vehicle floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAvailable Liquidity Resources\nWe had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n (1) As limited by the maximum consolidated leverage ratio in our credit agreement. \n (2) At December 31, 2016, we had $44.1 million of letters of credit outstanding. In addition, we use the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under the commercial paper program. We had $942.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2016, which in effect reduced the available liquidity under our revolving credit facility to $813.9 million. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (3) Based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance relating to insurance matters. At December 31, 2016, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $102.7 million, including the $44.1 million of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.\nIn February 2016, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that enables us to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, units, and guarantees of debt securities.\nCapital Allocation\nOur capital allocation strategy is focused on maximizing stockholder returns. We invest capital in our business to maintain and upgrade our existing facilities and to build new facilities, as well as for other strategic and technology initiatives, including the next phase of our brand extension strategy discussed above under Strategic Initiatives.\u201d We also deploy capital opportunistically to repurchase our common stock and/or debt or to complete dealership acquisitions and/or build facilities for newly awarded franchises. Our capital allocation decisions will be based on factors such as the expected rate of return on our investment, the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the market price of our debt, the potential impact on our capital structure, our ability to complete dealership acquisitions that meet our market and vehicle brand criteria and return on investment threshold, and limitations set forth in our debt agreements.\nShare Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors from time to time authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a certain monetary limit. A summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows:\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, $298.6 million remained available under our stock repurchase limit most recently authorized by our Board of Directors.\nThe decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our\n3.75x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years:\n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nThe following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years:\n\nDuring 2016, we purchased 20 stores located in Texas, New York, Colorado, California, and Maryland, which include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Sprinter, Jaguar, Land Rover, and BMW franchises. We also purchased a collision center in Illinois in 2016. We purchased 22 stores in 2015 and five stores in 2014.\nDuring 2016, we divested five Domestic stores and nine Import stores. In 2015, we divested three Import stores. In 2014, we divested two Import stores and our customer lead distribution business, which was reported in the Corporate and other\u201d category of our segment information.\nWe regularly review our store portfolio and may divest stores opportunistically. Since January 1, 2015, we have received $241.2 million of proceeds related to asset sales, including business and real estate divestitures. We have utilized those proceeds, and expect to utilize proceeds from future asset sales, to fund our capital investments and strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes.\nCash Dividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table sets forth our non-vehicle long-term debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n (1) The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.6 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $143.9 million due November 2017.  At December 31, 2016, we had $942.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.26% and a weighted-average remaining term of 24 days.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and commercial paper.\nRestrictions and Covenants\nOur credit agreement, the indentures for our senior unsecured notes, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities.\nUnder our credit agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non-vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non-vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Under our credit agreement, the maximum leverage ratio is 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio is 70.0%. In calculating our leverage and capitalization ratios, we are not required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million). In addition, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are permitted to add back to shareholders' equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long-lived asset impairment charges subsequent to September 30, 2014 plus $1.53 billion. The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our credit agreement, which we filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 4, 2014.\nThe indentures for our senior unsecured notes contain certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our credit agreement, at December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows:\n\nVehicle Floorplan Payable\nThe components of vehicle floorplan payable are as follows:\n\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our vehicle floorplan payable.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts-in-transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and finance and insurance products, collections from customers for the sale of parts and services, and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable-trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable-trade, purchases of parts inventory, personnel-related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, and was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by a decrease in earnings.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, and was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements and an increase in earnings.\nDuring 2014, we paid $7.2 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. Cash flows from operating activities in 2014 reflect $1.2 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to this refinancing transaction. In addition, we charged to expense $0.4 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities in 2014, discussed below, reflect $6.0 million of debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, and other transactions.\nWe will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return.\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, partially offset by an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet cash used in investing activities increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in property and equipment purchases, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade, and proceeds from stock option exercises.\n2016 compared to 2015\nUnder our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, during 2016, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $497.0 million (average purchase price per share of $47.30). Additionally, 38,906 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2016 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $235.1 million (average purchase price per share of $60.49). Additionally, 36,712 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2015 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.\nDuring 2015, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.35% Senior Notes due 2021 and $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025. Cash flows from financing activities in 2015 reflect cash payments of $6.4 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt arrangements.\nCash flows from financing activities include changes in commercial paper notes outstanding totaling net proceeds of $342.5 million during 2016 and $599.5 million during 2015.\nDuring 2016, we borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid $1.3 billion under our revolving credit facility. During 2015, we borrowed $1.4 billion and repaid $2.5 billion under our revolving credit facility, for net repayments of $1.1 billion.\nCash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaling net proceeds of $153.8 million during 2016 compared to net repayments of $13.3 million in 2015.\nDuring 2016, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nDuring 2014, we amended and restated our existing unsecured credit agreement and replaced our $500.0 million term loan facility and $1.2 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. The indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from our amended credit agreement. Cash flows from financing activities in 2014 also reflect cash payments of $6.0 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement. During 2014, we borrowed $2.8 billion and repaid $2.0 billion under our revolving credit facilities, for net borrowings of $810.0 million.\nNet cash flows from financing activities during 2015, as compared to 2014, were impacted primarily by the debt activity that occurred in 2015 as compared to 2014, described above, and a decrease in repurchases of common stock.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2016. The amounts presented are based upon, among other things, the terms of any relevant agreements. Future events that may occur related to the following payment obligations could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts.\n\n (1) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (2) Amounts for long-term debt obligations reflect principal payments and are not reduced for unamortized debt discounts of $2.6 million or debt issuance costs of $8.2 million. \n (3) Primarily represents scheduled fixed interest payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes, mortgage facility, and capital leases. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and commercial paper are excluded due to the short-term nature of these facilities. \n (4) Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2016, these charges totaled approximately $24 million. Additionally, operating leases that are on a month-to-month basis are not included. \n (5) Due to uncertainty regarding timing of payments expected beyond one year, long-term obligations for deferred compensation arrangements have been classified in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column. \n (6) Our estimated chargeback obligations do not have scheduled maturities, however, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. \n (7) Our estimated self-insurance obligations are based on management estimates and actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. \n (8) Primarily represents purchase orders and contracts in connection with information technology and communication systems and real estate construction projects.  We expect that the amounts above will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit agreement. In the case of payments due upon the maturity of our debt instruments, we currently expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2016, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash\ndeposits totaled $102.7 million, of which $44.1 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit.\nAs further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including without limitation statements regarding our brand extension strategy, open safety recalls, pending or planned acquisitions, strategic initiatives, expected future investments in our business, and our expectations for the future performance of our business and the automotive retail industry, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements that describe our objectives, plans or goals are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Words such as anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d goal,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d continue,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d could,\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The automotive retail industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict.  \u2022Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the incentive, marketing, and other programs of vehicle manufacturers.\n \u2022 We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. \n \u2022 If we are not able to maintain and enhance our retail brands and reputation or to attract consumers to our own digital channels, or if events occur that damage our retail brands, reputation, or sales channels, our business and financial results may be harmed. We are investing significantly in the next phase of our brand extension strategy, and if our strategic initiatives are not successful, we will have incurred significant expenses without the benefit of improved financial results. \n \u2022 New laws, regulations, or governmental policies regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards, or changes to existing standards, may affect vehicle manufacturers' ability to produce cost-effective vehicles or vehicles that consumers demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, and prospects. \n \u2022 Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. \n \u2022 We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. \n \u2022 We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. \n \u2022 Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in purported violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer. \n \u2022 A failure of our information systems or any security breach or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n \u2022 Our debt agreements contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. \n \u2022 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and commercial paper program that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. \n \u2022 Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders' equity. \n \u2022 Our largest stockholders, as a result of their ownership stakes in us, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders or Board of Directors. In addition, future share repurchases and fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders could impact the volume of trading, liquidity, and market price of our common stock.
