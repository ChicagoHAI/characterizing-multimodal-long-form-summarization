The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Based on its magnitude and because we are exiting the Personal Care business, the sale represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all periods presented reflect the Personal Care business as a discontinued operation. Our Personal Care business was previously disclosed as a separate reportable segment. For more information on our discontinued operations, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 3, Discontinued Operations\u201d.\nPurchase of Appvion Point of Sale Business\nOn April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Point of Sale paper business from Appvion Operations Inc. The business includes the coater and related equipment located at Appvion's West Carrollton, Ohio, facility as well as a license for all corresponding intellectual property and assumed liabilities related to post-retirement benefits. The results of this business have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of April 27, 2020 and are presented in the Pulp and Paper business. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 4 Acquisition of Business\u201d.\nChange in Reporting for EAM Corporation\nStarting January 1, 2020, as a result of changes in our organizational structure, EAM Corporation, a manufacturer of high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores, previously reported under our former Personal Care segment is now presented under our Pulp and Paper business. Prior period results have been restated to the new presentation with no significant impact on results. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 24 Segment Disclosures\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nFollowing our agreement to sell our Personal Care business, we now operate as a single reportable segment as described below, which also represents our only operating segment.\nPulp and Paper: Our Pulp and Paper business consists of the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of communication, specialty and packaging papers, as well as softwood, hardwood and fluff pulps and high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores.\nOur segment measure of profit (operating income (loss) from continuing operations) is used by management to evaluate performance and make operational decisions. Management believes that this measure allows for a better understanding of cost trends, operating efficiencies, prices and volume. Business segment operating income (loss) is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity losses, excluding corporate items, interest expense, net, and non-service components of net periodic benefit cost. Corporate expenses are allocated to our segment with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under Corporate\u201d and do not allocate to the segment.\n2020 HIGHLIGHTS\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We reported an operating loss of $177 million, compared to operating income of $179 million in 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We reported a loss from continuing operations of $145 million compared to earnings from continuing operations of $85 million in 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes amounted to $18 million in 2020, including a loss on classification as held for sale, net of tax, of $45 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Sales decreased by 16% from 2019.

We are actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it is impacting our employees, operations, customers, suppliers, liquidity and capital resources.\nOur operations are considered to be essential services in the jurisdictions where we operate. Certain of our paper products are used in the testing for COVID-19 as well as for personal protection medical gowns. However, demand for our paper has declined significantly since the beginning of April, largely due to work-from-home rules and the overall economic slowdown. The length and severity of the reduction in paper demand is uncertain; at the current time, we expect the adverse impact to continue through the first quarter of 2021. Beyond the first quarter of 2021, paper demand will depend largely on when, and the extent to which, work-from-home subsides and on the timing of the return to normal global economic activities.\nEffects from COVID-19 began for us at the end of the first quarter of 2020 but were not material to the three-month's results ended March 31, 2020. Shipments of paper were lower by approximately 19% in 2020 when compared to 2019. As a result of the decrease in demand, on August 7, 2020, we announced the permanent closure of the uncoated freesheet manufacturing at our Kingsport, Tennessee and Port Huron, Michigan mills, the remaining paper machine at our Ashdown, Arkansas mill and the converting center in Ridgefields, Tennessee. These actions reduced our annual uncoated freesheet paper capacity by approximately 721,000 short tons, and resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 750 employees. The Kingsport and Ashdown paper machines, which have been idled since April 2020, did not recommence operations. Our Ridgefields converting center ceased operations at the end of the third quarter of 2020, while our Port Huron mill is expected to shut down by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\nOur pulp shipments were higher by approximately 7% in 2020 when compared to 2019. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China.\nBelow we further describe specific impacts and the measures we have taken since March 2020.\nHealth and Safety of our Employees\nThe safety of our employees continues to be our primary focus. As COVID-19 has evolved, we have taken numerous steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, including: social distancing, providing personnel protection and thermal scanning, health monitoring, contact tracing and enhanced cleaning measures. In addition, we implemented travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely.\nOperations and Supply Chain\nWe continue to operate in compliance with the orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities in each of our locations, and we are working with our customers to meet their specific shipment needs. We continue to place a priority on business continuity and contingency planning, including potential planning for extended closures of any key facilities, whether because of government action or workforce disruption, or because of disruptions related to our key suppliers that might arise related to COVID-19. At this point, we have experienced only minor disruptions. We are actively monitoring our supply chain, and we may experience disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impacts or timing of those events, nor can we reasonably estimate our ability to mitigate such impacts.\nCost Reduction Program\nOn August 7, 2020 we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. The cost saving initiatives includes capacity reduction and asset closures (noted above), mill-level cost savings and rightsizing of support functions. See Cost Reduction Program below for more information on this program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have taken actions and may take other actions, intended to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the current uncertainty in the global markets. On May 5, 2020, we entered into a five-year $300 million term loan. We suspended our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program in 2020 and on February 11, 2021, we announced that we would resume our stock repurchase program. In addition, we completed a review of all planned capital expenditures for 2020 and reduced or delayed spending without compromising on safety or regulatory compliance. Our capital expenditures for 2020 were $175 million, a decrease of approximately $75 million compared to our planned spending.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe U.S. and Canadian governments have launched several support programs to provide assistance to companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to review the details of the various programs to determine whether we might qualify.\nThe Government of Canada created the CEWS to provide financial support for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent large layoffs. CEWS allows eligible entities to receive a subsidy retroactive to March 15, 2020. We qualified and applied for all periods identified under CEWS, from March 15 through December 31, 2020 and recognized $36 million (CDN $48 million) of income related to this subsidy in 2020.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2021, paper demand remains uncertain and dependent upon the COVID-19 recovery, in particular quarantine measures impacting the return to office and school. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China. Overall raw material costs are expected to moderately increase and freight costs are also expected to be higher.\nCOST REDUCTION PROGRAM\nOn August 7, 2020, we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program, targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. The costs saving initiatives include capacity reduction and asset closures, mill-level cost savings and rightsizing support functions. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve cross-functional collaboration, leveraging more efficient business processes.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $34 million of severance and termination costs, $31 million of inventory obsolescence, $12 million of environmental costs, $4 million of pension curtailment and settlement charges and $18 million of licenses fees, write-offs and other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nKingsport, Tennessee mill\nWe plan to enter the linerboard market with the conversion of our Kingsport paper machine. Once in full operation, the mill will produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing adjacent market. The conversion is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\nWe estimate the conversion cost to be between $300 and $350 million. Once fully operational, the mill is expected to be a low-cost, first quartile recycled linerboard mill in North America. The converted mill is expected to directly employ approximately 160 employees.\nAshdown, Arkansas mill\nWe will complete the conversion of our Ashdown mill to 100% softwood and fluff pulp, which will require $15 to $20 million of capital investments and is expected to be completed in early 2021. The mill will produce additional market hardwood pulp until it converts the fiberline to softwood pulp. The conversion of the fiberline to 100% softwood is also necessary for an eventual expansion into containerboard. Following the fiberline conversion, Ashdown will have annual production capacity of 775,000 tons of fluff and softwood pulp.

This decrease was mostly due to lower SG&A expenses and partially offset by an increase in restructuring expenses, both as a result of the cost reduction program.\nInterest Expense, net\nWe incurred $58 million of net interest expense in 2020, an increase of $6 million compared to net interest expense of $52 million in 2019. The net interest expense was impacted by the $300 million Term Loan entered into on May 5, 2020 as well as an increase in borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $76 million in 2020 compared to an income tax expense of $17 million in 2019, which yielded an effective tax rate of 35% and 16% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn January 7, 2021, we agreed to sell our Personal Care business to American Industrial Partners (AIP) for $920 million. As such, for the December 31, 2020 reporting period, we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in that business and have classified our investment in that business as held for sale. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $51 million for the difference between the net book value of the business and the tax basis of that business which impacted the effective tax rate in 2020.\nWe have assessed the value of the deferred tax asset related to the book/tax basis difference, which is expected to be a capital loss for tax purposes upon the completion of the sale and determined that we are not likely to realize a full benefit from the asset. As such, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $44 million associated with this deferred tax asset. During the year, we also analyzed our existing Arkansas research and development credits and determined an additional valuation allowance of $3 million should be recorded since it is expected these credits will expire un-utilized. These amounts unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020.\nDuring 2020, we generated a U.S. tax net operating loss which, in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act will be carried back to 2015. In 2015, the US federal tax rate was 35%, versus the current rate of 21%. Therefore, we recorded an additional tax benefit of $5 million related to the tax rate benefit of the loss which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020. We also recorded $17 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020. Since we have a tax loss in 2020, the tax credits will be carried forward and are expected to be utilized in future years.\nAs a result of the deemed mandatory repatriation tax requirement of the U.S. Tax Reform, we have taxed our undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, at reduced tax rates. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on our business operations, we had determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. As such, as of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million ($12 million as of December 31, 2019) for foreign withholding tax and various state income taxes associated with future repatriation of these earnings. This additional $1 million tax benefit impacted the effective tax rate for 2020 ($2 million tax expense for 2019).\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2019, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Arkansas legislation changes were passed in 2019 which reduced the state tax rate and changed how the apportionment factor is calculated. This resulted in a deferred state tax benefit of $4 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded in 2019 on state attributes we do not expect to utilize before they expire.\nEconomic conditions and uncertainties\nThe markets in which our pulp and paper business operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers. Most of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers as well. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand. We also compete on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering and service solutions. Further, we compete against electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As a result of such competition, we are experiencing ongoing decreasing demand for most of our existing paper products. In addition, current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement.\nThe pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the basis of access to low-cost wood fiber, product quality and competitively priced pulp products.\nThe high degree of uncertainty and volatility day-to-day and the longer-term potential impacts of the economic slowdown remain unclear. In 2021, paper demand remains uncertain and dependent upon the COVID-19 recovery, in particular quarantine measures impacting the return to office and school. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China.

Following the inspection and given the cyclically low pulp prices, we made the decision to fast-track some maintenance work that was originally planned for 2020 in order to address some reliability risks. This extended shutdown impacted mostly our second half of 2019 by adding approximately $36 million of maintenance costs and lowering our total production by approximately 60,000 tonnes.\nOTHER FACTORS\nCorporate\nWe incurred $47 million of corporate charges in both 2019 and 2018. Corporates charges decreased mostly due to a decrease in environmental provision and was offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\nInterest expense, net\nWe incurred $52 million of net interest expense in 2019, a decrease of $10 million compared to net interest expense of $62 million in 2018. The net interest expense was impacted by the repayment of the $300 million Term Loan in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $17 million in 2019 compared to an income tax expense of $68 million in 2018, which yielded an effective tax rate of 16% and 19% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2019, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Arkansas legislation changes were passed in 2019 which reduced the state tax rate and changed how the apportionment factor is calculated. This resulted in a deferred state tax benefit of $4 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded on state attributes we do not expect to utilize before they expire.\nAs a result of the deemed mandatory repatriation tax requirement of the U.S. Tax Reform, we have taxed our undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, at reduced tax rates. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on business operations, we have determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. Therefore, as of December 31, 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $12 million ($10 million as December 31, 2018) for foreign withholding tax and various state income taxes associated with future repatriation of these earnings. This $2 million tax expense impacted the effective tax rate for 2019 ($10 million expense for 2018).\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2018, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impact the effective tax rate. We also recognized $3 million of tax benefits relating to 2018 law changes in Sweden and various U.S. states which favorably impacted our effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Reform significantly changed U.S. tax law for businesses by, among other things, lowering the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we completed our analysis, including currently available legislative updates, and recorded an additional tax benefit of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Of this benefit, $7 million related to adjustments to the deemed mandatory repatriation tax and $6 million related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATION\nOn January 7, 2021, we signed an agreement to sell our Personal Care business. Its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported earnings on discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $18 million (2019 - loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $1 million; 2018 - earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $2 million). For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 3, Discontinued Operations\u201d.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nUnder the Omnibus Plan, we may award to key employees and non-employee directors, at the discretion of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance-conditioned restricted stock units, performance share units, deferred share units ( DSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards. The non-employee directors only receive DSUs. We generally grant awards annually and use, when available, treasury stock to fulfill awards settled in common stock and options exercised.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation expense recognized in our results from continuing and discontinued operations was $7 million (2019 - $22 million) for all of the outstanding awards. Compensation costs not yet recognized amounted to $15 million (2019 - $16 million) and will be recognized over the remaining service period of approximately 14 months. The aggregate value of liability awards settled in 2020 was $6 million (2019 - $12 million). The total fair value of equity awards settled in 2020 was $6 million (2019 - $11 million), representing the fair value at the time of settlement. The fair value at the grant date for these settled equity awards was $7 million (2019 - $6 million). Compensation costs for performance awards are based on management's best estimate of the final performance measurement.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal cash requirements are for ongoing operating costs, pension contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt and income tax payments. We expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily with internally generated funds from our operations and, to the extent necessary, through borrowings under our $700 million credit facility, of which $646 million is currently undrawn and available, or through our $150 million receivables securitization facility, of which $111 million is currently undrawn and available. Under adverse market conditions, there can be no assurance that these agreements would be available or sufficient. See Capital Resources\u201d below.\nOur ability to make payments on the requirements mentioned above will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit and receivable securitization facilities and debt indentures impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities.\nA portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the foreign subsidiaries reflect full provision for local income taxes. The U.S. Tax Reform includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we recorded a provisional repatriation tax amount of $46 million in 2017 and adjusted by $7 million in 2018. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on the business operations, we have determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. We remain indefinitely reinvested in the outside basis differences of our foreign subsidiaries, except for our Personal Care business which we are selling. We do not anticipate any additional cash tax liability associated with repatriating the proceeds of the sale other than what is already provided.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flow requirements are primarily for salaries and benefits, the purchase of raw materials, including fiber and energy, and other expenses such as income tax and property taxes.\nCash flows from operating activities, including discontinued operations, totaled $411 million in 2020, a $31 million decrease compared to cash flows from operating activities of $442 million in 2019. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in profitability partially offset by an improvement in cash flow from working capital requirements. We received income tax refunds, net of payments, of $22 million in 2020 compared to income tax payments, net of refunds of $59 million in 2019. We paid $4 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contributions in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense in 2020 compared to 2019 when we paid $1 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contributions in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense when excluding our non-cash pension settlement loss of $30 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities, including discontinued operations, in 2020 amounted to $202 million, a $52 million decrease compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $254 million in 2019.\nThe use of cash in 2020 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $175 million and the acquisition of the Appvion Point of Sale Business in the second quarter of 2020 ($30 million).\nThe use of cash in 2019 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $255 million.\nOur annual capital expenditures for 2021 should increase due mostly to our Kingsport mill conversion and are expected to be between $310 million and $330 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided from financing activities, including discontinued operations, totaled $35 million in 2020 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $237 million in 2019.\nThe primary source of cash flows provided from financing activities was from proceeds of the term loan in 2020 ($300 million). This was partially offset by the decrease in borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivables securitization) ($135 million), the repurchase of our common stock ($59 million), dividend payments ($51 million) and a decrease in bank indebtedness ($10 million).\nThe use of cash in 2019 was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock ($219 million) and dividend payments ($110 million). This was partially offset by the net increase of borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivables securitization) ($85 million).\nCapital Resources\nNet indebtedness, consisting of bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $788 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $886 million as of December 31, 2019.\nTerm Loan\nOn May 5, 2020, we entered into a $300 million Term Loan Agreement that matures on May 5, 2025. We used borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement to repay other debt, to pay related fees and expenses. A mandatory repayment of $6 million was made in 2020. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 19 Long-Term Debt\u201d.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have an unsecured $700 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain domestic and foreign banks that matures on August 22, 2023.\nBorrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings by certain foreign subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company, our significant domestic subsidiaries and certain of our significant foreign subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR, EURIBOR, Canadian bankers' acceptance or prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin linked to our credit rating. In addition, we pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and events of default for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1 (or 4.00 to 1 upon the occurrence of certain qualifying material acquisitions). At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these financial covenants, and had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement (December 31, 2019- $80 million). At December 31, 2020, our interest coverage ratio was 8.2 and our leverage ratio was 1.9. At December 31, 2020, we had $54 million of outstanding letters of credit (December 31, 2019 - nil), leaving $646 million unused and available under this facility (December 31, 2019 - $620 million).\nReceivables Securitization\nWe have a $150 million receivables securitization facility that matures in November 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under the receivables securitization facility, and had no outstanding letters of credit under the program (December 31, 2019 - $55 million and $53 million, respectively). The program contains certain termination events, which include, but are not limited to, matters related to receivable performance, certain defaults occurring under the Credit Agreement or our failure to repay or satisfy material obligations. At December 31, 2020, we had $111 million unused and available under this facility.\nCommon Stock\nOn May 5, 2020, we suspended the distribution of our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program in light of current uncertainty in the global markets. Our stock repurchase program resumed on February 11, 2021. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our capital return program based upon customary considerations, including market conditions.\nDuring 2020, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share, to holders of our common stock. Total dividends aggregating $25 million were paid on April 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2020.\nDuring 2019, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.435 and three quarterly dividends of $0.455 per share, to holders of our common stock. Dividends aggregating $28 million, $28 million, $27 million and $26 million were paid on April 15, 2019, July 16, 2019, October 15, 2019 and January 15, 2020, respectively, to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2019, July 2, 2019, October 2, 2019 and January 2, 2020, respectively.\nGUARANTEES\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we offer indemnifications relating to the sale of our businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At December 31, 2020, we were unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded significant expenses in the past.\nPension Plans\nWe have indemnified and held harmless the trustees of our pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from us or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we do not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables provide our obligations and commitments at December 31, 2020:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> CONTRACT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> THEREAFTER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (excluding interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance leases and other (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term income taxes payable (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> COMMITMENT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> THEREAFTER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other commercial commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> In connection with the U.S. Tax Reform, we have remaining liabilities of $30 million in repatriation tax to pay through 2025.

Notes referenced in this section are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and choices amongst acceptable accounting methods that affect our reported results of operations and financial position. Critical accounting estimates pertain to matters that contain a significant level of management estimates about future events, encompass the most complex and subjective judgments and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental matters and asset retirement obligations, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, closure and restructuring costs, intangible assets impairment, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes and contingencies related to legal claims. These critical accounting estimates and policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe these accounting policies, and others as set forth in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, should be reviewed as they are essential to understanding our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEnvironmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe maintain provisions for estimated environmental costs when remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental provisions relate mainly to air emissions, effluent treatment, silvicultural activities and site remediation (together referred to as environmental matters\u201d). The environmental cost estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as contribution by other responsible parties. Additional information regarding environmental matters is available in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nWhile we believe that we have determined the costs for environmental matters likely to be incurred, based on known information, our ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with the properties may lead to future environmental investigations. These efforts may result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, environmental laws and regulations and interpretation by regulatory authorities could change which could result in significant changes to our estimates. For further details on Climate change regulation\u201d and other environmental matters refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nAsset retirement obligations are mainly associated with landfill operation and closure, dredging of settling ponds and bark pile management. We recognize asset retirement obligations, at fair value, in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset. The fair value is based on the expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes are considered. Probabilities are applied to each of the cash flow scenarios to arrive at an expected cash flow. The estimated cash flows are then discounted using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate in combination with business-specific and other relevant risks to discount the cash flow. The rates used vary between 4.7% and 12.0%.\nCash flow estimates incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value, whenever that information is available without undue cost and effort. If unavailable, assumptions are based on internal experts, third-party engineers' studies and historical experience in remediation work. As at December 31, 2020, we had an asset retirement obligation provision of $14 million for 12 locations (2019 - $13 million).\nAs at December 31, 2020, we had a total provision of $47 million for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations (2019 - $35 million). Certain of these amounts have been discounted due to more certainty of the timing of expenditures using the credit adjusted risk-free interest rate for the corresponding period until the settlement date. The rates used vary, based on the prevailing rate at the moment of recognition of the liability and on its settlement period. Additional costs, not known or identified, could be incurred for remediation efforts. Based on policies and procedures in place to monitor environmental exposure, management believes that such additional remediation costs would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, result of operations or cash flows.\nImpairment of Property Plant and Equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that, at the lowest level of determinable cash flows, the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Step I of the impairment test assesses if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted future cash flows in order to assess if the property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets are impaired. In the event the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the net book value of the assets, a Step II impairment test must be carried out to determine the impairment charge. In Step II, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Given that there is generally no readily available quoted value for our property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets, we determine fair value of our assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition, and by using the liquidation or salvage value in the case of idled assets. The fair value estimate in Step II is based on the undiscounted cash flows used in Step I.\nEstimates of undiscounted future cash flows used to test the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of use assets and definite-lived intangible assets includes key assumptions related to selling prices, inflation-adjusted cost projections, forecasted exchange rates (when applicable) and estimated useful life. Changes in our assumptions and estimates may affect our forecasts and may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required. In addition, actual results may vary from our forecasts, and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where our conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions.\nUseful Lives\nOn a regular basis, we review the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment and our definite-lived intangible assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets requires judgment and is based on currently available information. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business strategy, changes to our capital strategy or changes in regulation can result in useful lives differing from our estimates. Revisions to the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets constitute a change in accounting estimate and are dealt with prospectively by amending depreciation and amortization rates.\nA change in the remaining estimated useful life of a group of assets, or their estimated net salvage value, will affect the depreciation or amortization rate used to depreciate or amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation or amortization expense as reported in our results of operations. In 2020, we recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $223 million compared to $231 million in 2019. At December 31, 2020, we had property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $2,023 million (2019 - $2,223 million) and definite-lived intangible assets, net of amortization, of $19 million (2019 - $20 million).\nIn 2020, we recognized $136 million of accelerated depreciation, mostly related to our announced permanent closure of our uncoated freesheet manufacturing at Kingsport, Tennessee and Port Huron, Michigan mills, the remaining paper machine at the Ashdown, Arkansas mill and the converting center in Ridgefield, Tennessee.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we announced the permanent closure of two paper machines. These closures took place at our Ashdown, Arkansas pulp and paper mill and our Port Huron, Michigan paper mill. As a result, we recognized $32 million of accelerated depreciation in 2019.\nClosure and Restructuring Costs\nClosure and restructuring costs are recognized as liabilities in the period when they are incurred and are measured at their fair value. For such recognition to occur, management, with the appropriate level of authority, must have approved and committed to a firm plan\nand appropriate communication to those affected must have occurred. These provisions may require an estimation of costs such as severance and termination benefits, pension and related curtailments, environmental remediation and may also include expenses related to demolition and outplacement. Actions taken may also require an evaluation of any remaining assets to determine required impairments, if any, and a review of estimated remaining useful lives which may lead to accelerated depreciation expense.\nEstimates of cash flows and fair value relating to closures and restructuring require judgment. Closure and restructuring liabilities are based on management's best estimates of future events. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may differ from these estimates due to subsequent business developments. As such, additional costs and further impairment charges may be required in future periods.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $34 million of severance and termination costs, $31 million of inventory obsolescence and $34 million of other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $32 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets and $1 million of accelerated depreciation under Depreciation and amortization, on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $3 million of severance and termination costs, $4 million of inventory obsolescence and $2 million of other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs in relation to the paper machine closures. Concurrently, with the Ashdown paper machine closure and related workforce reduction, management negotiated a voluntary early retirement program to reduce costs and put the mill in a stronger cost position in the long-term. We additionally recorded $13 million of severance and termination costs under Closure and restructuring costs.\nAdditional information can be found under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of license rights ($6 million) and water rights ($4 million). We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the asset level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are evaluated at the beginning of the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. In connection with the Company's annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment for each indefinite-lived intangible asset (license rights and water rights). The qualitative assessments performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated that the indefinite-lived intangible assets had fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts.\nPension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWe have several defined contribution plans and multiemployer plans. The pension expense under these plans is equal to our contribution. Defined contribution pension expense was $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $39 million).\nWe sponsor both contributory and non-contributory U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor a number of other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees; the plans are unfunded and include life insurance programs and medical and dental benefits. In addition, we provide supplemental unfunded defined benefit pension plans and supplemental unfunded defined contribution pension plans to certain senior management employees.\nWe account for pensions and other post-retirement benefits in accordance with Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board-Accounting Standards Committee which requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and other post-retirement benefit charges require assumptions in order to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations. These assumptions require considerable management judgment and include:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets - used to estimate the growth and expected return on assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Discount rate - used to determine interest costs and the net present value of our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Rate of compensation increase - used to calculate the impact of future increases on our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Health care cost trends - used to calculate the impact of future health care costs on our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Employee related factors, such as mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and disabilities - used to determine the extent of our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are amortized over the expected average remaining service life of the active employee group covered by the plans, only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess\nof 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market value of assets, over the average remaining service period of approximately ten years of the active employee group covered by the pension plans, and 12 years of the active employee group covered by the other post-retirement benefits plans.\nAn expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.6% was considered appropriate by management for the determination of pension expense for 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, we will use 4.4% as the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the current view of long-term investment returns. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on management's best estimate of the long-term returns of the major asset classes (cash and cash equivalents, equities and bonds) weighted by the target allocation of assets at the measurement date, net of expenses. This rate includes an equity risk premium over government bond returns for equity investments and a value-added premium for the contribution to returns from active management. The sources used to determine management's best estimate of long-term returns are numerous and include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country-specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts' or governments' expectations, as applicable.\nWe set our discount rate assumption annually to reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed income debt instruments, with a duration that is expected to match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. High-quality debt instruments are corporate bonds with a rating of AA or better. The discount rates at December 31, 2020 for pension plans were estimated at 2.5% for the projected benefit obligation and 3.0% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2020 and for post-retirement benefit plans were estimated at 2.5% for the projected benefit obligation and 3.0% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2020.\nWe used a full yield curve approach to estimate the current service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for Canadian pension plans and U.S. funded pension plans. The estimate of these components is made by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We used this approach to provide a more precise measurement of current service and interest cost components by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.\nThe rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption in the actuarial model for pension (set at 2.7% for the projected benefit obligation and 2.8% for the net periodic benefit cost) and for post-retirement benefit plans (set at 2.8% for the projected benefit obligation and 2.7% for the net periodic benefit cost) and is determined based upon our long-term plans for such increases.\nFor employee related factors, mortality rate tables tailored to our industry were used and the other factors reflect our historical experience and management's best estimate regarding future expectations.\nFor measurement purposes, a 3.9% weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2020.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the key weighted average economic assumptions used in measuring the projected pension benefit obligation, the accrued other post-retirement benefit obligation and related net periodic benefit cost for 2020. The sensitivity analysis should be used with caution as it is hypothetical and changes in each key assumption may not be linear. The sensitivities in each key variable have been calculated independently of each other.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other Post-Retirement Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected rate of return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (189\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually the amount required to provide for benefits earned in the year and to fund solvency deficiencies, funding shortfalls and past service obligations over periods not exceeding those permitted by the applicable regulatory authorities. Past service obligations primarily arise from improvements to plan benefits. The other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded and contributions are made annually to cover benefit payments.\nWe expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $13 million in 2021 compared to $15 million in 2020 (2019 - $17 million) to the pension plans. We expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $4 million in 2021 compared to $4 million in 2020 to the other post-retirement benefit plans (2019 - $4 million).\nBenefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 for our pension and post-retirement plans were are follows:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> post-retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> post-retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected benefit obligation at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,566\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,425\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of assets at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional details on our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, refer to Note 7 Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\u201d.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined according to differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. The change in the net deferred tax asset or liability is included in earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the years in which assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these years, a projection of taxable income and an assumption of the ultimate recovery or settlement period for temporary differences are required. The projection of future taxable income is based on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\nWe assess the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and, if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on these taxable income projections, a valuation allowance is recorded. In general, realization\u201d refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or an increase in future taxes refundable from the deferred tax assets. Evaluating the need for an amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment. All available evidence, both positive and negative, should be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. In our evaluation process, we give the most weight to historical income or losses. After evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, although realization is not assured, we determined that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, with the exception of certain state credits and losses for which a valuation allowance of $13 million exists at December 31, 2020, the tax basis difference in our assets held of sale (U.S. and foreign) for which a valuation allowance of $44 million exists at December 31, 2020, and certain foreign loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance of $7 million exists at December 31, 2020. Of this amount, $47 million unfavorably impacted tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2020 (2019 -$5 million).\nOur deferred tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to various accruals, accounting provisions, pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, and available tax credits. Our deferred tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences pertaining to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, leases and other items. Estimating the ultimate settlement period requires judgment. The reversal of timing differences is expected at enacted tax rates, which could change due to changes in income tax laws or the introduction of tax changes through the presentation of annual budgets by different governments. As a result, a change in the timing and the income tax rate at which the components will reverse could materially affect deferred tax expense in our future results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities. To the best of our knowledge, we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law. In accordance with Income Taxes Topic of FASB ASC 740, we evaluate new tax positions that result in a tax benefit to us and determine the amount of tax benefits that can be recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if changes in recognition or classification are necessary. Significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected within the next 12 months are disclosed quarterly. Future\nrecognition of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate in the period the benefits are recognized. At December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $23 million (2019 - $28 million). These amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were sustained, such as federal deduction that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained. As of December 31, 2020, we believe it is reasonably possible that up to $4 million of our unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized in 2021, which could impact the effective tax rate. However, the amount and timing of the recognition of these benefits is subject to some uncertainty. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporation multinationals, such as the U.S. Tax Reform, enacted in 2017. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Reform that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially impact our financial results.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities.\nTax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law, and we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further details refer to Note 10 Income Taxes\u201d.\nContingencies related to legal claims\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, under the risk Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results or condition\u201d and in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount is reasonably estimable. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of the then available facts with respect to each matter. When no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. For further details on Contingencies\u201d and legal claims refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Topics discussed and analyzed include:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 2020 Highlights \n \u2022 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Outlook \n \u2022 Cost Reduction Program \n \u2022 Review of Continuing Operations \n \u2022 Discontinued Operations of our Personal Care Business \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies \nFor a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, other than Results of Operations\u201d, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\nSale of Personal Care Business\nOn January 7, 2021, we agreed to sell our Personal Care business to American Industrial Partners ( AIP\u201d), for a purchase price of $920 million in cash (the Transaction\u201d). The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Based on its magnitude and because we are exiting the Personal Care business, the sale represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all periods presented reflect the Personal Care business as a discontinued operation. Our Personal Care business was previously disclosed as a separate reportable segment. For more information on our discontinued operations, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 3, Discontinued Operations\u201d.\nPurchase of Appvion Point of Sale Business\nOn April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Point of Sale paper business from Appvion Operations Inc. The business includes the coater and related equipment located at Appvion's West Carrollton, Ohio, facility as well as a license for all corresponding intellectual property and assumed liabilities related to post-retirement benefits. The results of this business have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of April 27, 2020 and are presented in the Pulp and Paper business. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 4 Acquisition of Business\u201d.\nChange in Reporting for EAM Corporation\nStarting January 1, 2020, as a result of changes in our organizational structure, EAM Corporation, a manufacturer of high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores, previously reported under our former Personal Care segment is now presented under our Pulp and Paper business. Prior period results have been restated to the new presentation with no significant impact on results. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 24 Segment Disclosures\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nFollowing our agreement to sell our Personal Care business, we now operate as a single reportable segment as described below, which also represents our only operating segment.\nPulp and Paper: Our Pulp and Paper business consists of the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of communication, specialty and packaging papers, as well as softwood, hardwood and fluff pulps and high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores.\nOur segment measure of profit (operating income (loss) from continuing operations) is used by management to evaluate performance and make operational decisions. Management believes that this measure allows for a better understanding of cost trends, operating efficiencies, prices and volume. Business segment operating income (loss) is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity losses, excluding corporate items, interest expense, net, and non-service components of net periodic benefit cost. Corporate expenses are allocated to our segment with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under Corporate\u201d and do not allocate to the segment.\n2020 HIGHLIGHTS\n \u2022 We reported an operating loss of $177 million, compared to operating income of $179 million in 2019 \n \u2022 We reported a loss from continuing operations of $145 million compared to earnings from continuing operations of $85 million in 2019 \n \u2022 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes amounted to $18 million in 2020, including a loss on classification as held for sale, net of tax, of $45 million \n \u2022 Sales decreased by 16% from 2019. Net average selling prices for pulp and paper were down from 2019. Our manufactured paper volume was down while our pulp volume was up when compared to 2019 \n \u2022 Recognition of closure and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets, of $99 million and $136 million, respectively, mostly related to our announced cost reduction program \n \u2022 Recognition of $36 million (CDN $48 million) from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ( CEWS\u201d) and received a $7 million payment from waiving the non-production clause related to the sale agreement of our Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon kraft pulp mill in 2012 \n \u2022 We repurchased $59 million of our common stock and paid $51 million in dividends. Our capital return program, which includes our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program, was suspended in the second quarter of 2020. On February 11, 2021, we announced that we will resume our stock repurchase program \nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve months ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

In 2019, we recognized closure and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets of $22 million and $32 million, respectively associated with our decision to permanently close two paper machines. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d for more information. In 2018, we did not recognize any closure and restructuring charges or impairment of long-lived assets. \n (b) See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 6 \"Earnings (Loss) per Common Share\" for more information on the calculation of net earnings per common share. \nIMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nWith the unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world due to the pandemic, this virus has had a profound impact on human health, the global economy and society in general. We are actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it is impacting our employees, operations, customers, suppliers, liquidity and capital resources.\nOur operations are considered to be essential services in the jurisdictions where we operate. Certain of our paper products are used in the testing for COVID-19 as well as for personal protection medical gowns. However, demand for our paper has declined significantly since the beginning of April, largely due to work-from-home rules and the overall economic slowdown. The length and severity of the reduction in paper demand is uncertain; at the current time, we expect the adverse impact to continue through the first quarter of 2021. Beyond the first quarter of 2021, paper demand will depend largely on when, and the extent to which, work-from-home subsides and on the timing of the return to normal global economic activities.\nEffects from COVID-19 began for us at the end of the first quarter of 2020 but were not material to the three-month's results ended March 31, 2020. Shipments of paper were lower by approximately 19% in 2020 when compared to 2019. As a result of the decrease in demand, on August 7, 2020, we announced the permanent closure of the uncoated freesheet manufacturing at our Kingsport, Tennessee and Port Huron, Michigan mills, the remaining paper machine at our Ashdown, Arkansas mill and the converting center in Ridgefields, Tennessee. These actions reduced our annual uncoated freesheet paper capacity by approximately 721,000 short tons, and resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 750 employees. The Kingsport and Ashdown paper machines, which have been idled since April 2020, did not recommence operations. Our Ridgefields converting center ceased operations at the end of the third quarter of 2020, while our Port Huron mill is expected to shut down by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\nOur pulp shipments were higher by approximately 7% in 2020 when compared to 2019. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China.\nBelow we further describe specific impacts and the measures we have taken since March 2020.\nHealth and Safety of our Employees\nThe safety of our employees continues to be our primary focus. As COVID-19 has evolved, we have taken numerous steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, including: social distancing, providing personnel protection and thermal scanning, health monitoring, contact tracing and enhanced cleaning measures. In addition, we implemented travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely.\nOperations and Supply Chain\nWe continue to operate in compliance with the orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities in each of our locations, and we are working with our customers to meet their specific shipment needs. We continue to place a priority on business continuity and contingency planning, including potential planning for extended closures of any key facilities, whether because of government action or workforce disruption, or because of disruptions related to our key suppliers that might arise related to COVID-19. At this point, we have experienced only minor disruptions. We are actively monitoring our supply chain, and we may experience disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impacts or timing of those events, nor can we reasonably estimate our ability to mitigate such impacts.\nCost Reduction Program\nOn August 7, 2020 we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. The cost saving initiatives includes capacity reduction and asset closures (noted above), mill-level cost savings and rightsizing of support functions. See Cost Reduction Program below for more information on this program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have taken actions and may take other actions, intended to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the current uncertainty in the global markets. On May 5, 2020, we entered into a five-year $300 million term loan. We suspended our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program in 2020 and on February 11, 2021, we announced that we would resume our stock repurchase program. In addition, we completed a review of all planned capital expenditures for 2020 and reduced or delayed spending without compromising on safety or regulatory compliance. Our capital expenditures for 2020 were $175 million, a decrease of approximately $75 million compared to our planned spending.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe U.S. and Canadian governments have launched several support programs to provide assistance to companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to review the details of the various programs to determine whether we might qualify.\nThe Government of Canada created the CEWS to provide financial support for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent large layoffs. CEWS allows eligible entities to receive a subsidy retroactive to March 15, 2020. We qualified and applied for all periods identified under CEWS, from March 15 through December 31, 2020 and recognized $36 million (CDN $48 million) of income related to this subsidy in 2020.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2021, paper demand remains uncertain and dependent upon the COVID-19 recovery, in particular quarantine measures impacting the return to office and school. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China. Overall raw material costs are expected to moderately increase and freight costs are also expected to be higher.\nCOST REDUCTION PROGRAM\nOn August 7, 2020, we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program, targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. The costs saving initiatives include capacity reduction and asset closures, mill-level cost savings and rightsizing support functions. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve cross-functional collaboration, leveraging more efficient business processes.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $34 million of severance and termination costs, $31 million of inventory obsolescence, $12 million of environmental costs, $4 million of pension curtailment and settlement charges and $18 million of licenses fees, write-offs and other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nKingsport, Tennessee mill\nWe plan to enter the linerboard market with the conversion of our Kingsport paper machine. Once in full operation, the mill will produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing adjacent market. The conversion is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\nWe estimate the conversion cost to be between $300 and $350 million. Once fully operational, the mill is expected to be a low-cost, first quartile recycled linerboard mill in North America. The converted mill is expected to directly employ approximately 160 employees.\nAshdown, Arkansas mill\nWe will complete the conversion of our Ashdown mill to 100% softwood and fluff pulp, which will require $15 to $20 million of capital investments and is expected to be completed in early 2021. The mill will produce additional market hardwood pulp until it converts the fiberline to softwood pulp. The conversion of the fiberline to 100% softwood is also necessary for an eventual expansion into containerboard. Following the fiberline conversion, Ashdown will have annual production capacity of 775,000 tons of fluff and softwood pulp.

This decrease in sales is mostly due to a decrease in our paper sales volumes and a decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in pulp sales volumes.\nSales in 2019 decreased by $196 million, or 4% when compared to sales in 2018. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a decrease in our paper sales volumes and a decrease in net average selling price for pulp.

Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Lower net average selling prices for pulp and paper ($208 million) \n \u2022 Lower volume/ mix ($125 million) mostly related to lower volume of paper, partially offset by higher volume of pulp \n \u2022 Higher depreciation/impairment charges ($97 million).

This decrease was mostly due to lower SG&A expenses and partially offset by an increase in restructuring expenses, both as a result of the cost reduction program.\nInterest Expense, net\nWe incurred $58 million of net interest expense in 2020, an increase of $6 million compared to net interest expense of $52 million in 2019. The net interest expense was impacted by the $300 million Term Loan entered into on May 5, 2020 as well as an increase in borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $76 million in 2020 compared to an income tax expense of $17 million in 2019, which yielded an effective tax rate of 35% and 16% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn January 7, 2021, we agreed to sell our Personal Care business to American Industrial Partners (AIP) for $920 million. As such, for the December 31, 2020 reporting period, we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in that business and have classified our investment in that business as held for sale. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $51 million for the difference between the net book value of the business and the tax basis of that business which impacted the effective tax rate in 2020.\nWe have assessed the value of the deferred tax asset related to the book/tax basis difference, which is expected to be a capital loss for tax purposes upon the completion of the sale and determined that we are not likely to realize a full benefit from the asset. As such, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $44 million associated with this deferred tax asset. During the year, we also analyzed our existing Arkansas research and development credits and determined an additional valuation allowance of $3 million should be recorded since it is expected these credits will expire un-utilized. These amounts unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020.\nDuring 2020, we generated a U.S. tax net operating loss which, in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act will be carried back to 2015. In 2015, the US federal tax rate was 35%, versus the current rate of 21%. Therefore, we recorded an additional tax benefit of $5 million related to the tax rate benefit of the loss which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020. We also recorded $17 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020. Since we have a tax loss in 2020, the tax credits will be carried forward and are expected to be utilized in future years.\nAs a result of the deemed mandatory repatriation tax requirement of the U.S. Tax Reform, we have taxed our undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, at reduced tax rates. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on our business operations, we had determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. As such, as of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million ($12 million as of December 31, 2019) for foreign withholding tax and various state income taxes associated with future repatriation of these earnings. This additional $1 million tax benefit impacted the effective tax rate for 2020 ($2 million tax expense for 2019).\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2019, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Arkansas legislation changes were passed in 2019 which reduced the state tax rate and changed how the apportionment factor is calculated. This resulted in a deferred state tax benefit of $4 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded in 2019 on state attributes we do not expect to utilize before they expire.\nEconomic conditions and uncertainties\nThe markets in which our pulp and paper business operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers. Most of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers as well. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand. We also compete on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering and service solutions. Further, we compete against electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As a result of such competition, we are experiencing ongoing decreasing demand for most of our existing paper products. In addition, current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement.\nThe pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the basis of access to low-cost wood fiber, product quality and competitively priced pulp products.\nThe high degree of uncertainty and volatility day-to-day and the longer-term potential impacts of the economic slowdown remain unclear. In 2021, paper demand remains uncertain and dependent upon the COVID-19 recovery, in particular quarantine measures impacting the return to office and school. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China.

Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Higher operating expenses ($128 million) mostly due to lower production as well as higher maintenance and fixed costs due to timing of major maintenance \n \u2022 Higher input costs ($46 million) mostly related to higher costs of fiber due mostly to severe weather conditions as well as unfavorable market conditions, partially offset by lower costs of chemicals and energy \n \u2022 Lower volume and mix ($46 million) mostly related to lower volume of paper, partially offset by higher volume of pulp \n \u2022 Higher depreciation/impairment charges ($23 million) mostly due to our decision to permanently close two paper machines in 2019 \n \u2022 Higher restructuring charges ($22 million) due to our decision to permanently close two paper machines in 2019 \n \u2022 Higher other income/expense ($11 million) \nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 Higher average selling prices for paper partially offset by lower average selling prices for pulp ($52 million) \n \u2022 Positive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our Canadian denominated expenses, net of our hedging program ($8 million) \nOur Espanola pulp and specialty paper mill underwent an extensive audit and inspection of major components during its outage in June 2019. Following the inspection and given the cyclically low pulp prices, we made the decision to fast-track some maintenance work that was originally planned for 2020 in order to address some reliability risks. This extended shutdown impacted mostly our second half of 2019 by adding approximately $36 million of maintenance costs and lowering our total production by approximately 60,000 tonnes.\nOTHER FACTORS\nCorporate\nWe incurred $47 million of corporate charges in both 2019 and 2018. Corporates charges decreased mostly due to a decrease in environmental provision and was offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\nInterest expense, net\nWe incurred $52 million of net interest expense in 2019, a decrease of $10 million compared to net interest expense of $62 million in 2018. The net interest expense was impacted by the repayment of the $300 million Term Loan in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $17 million in 2019 compared to an income tax expense of $68 million in 2018, which yielded an effective tax rate of 16% and 19% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2019, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Arkansas legislation changes were passed in 2019 which reduced the state tax rate and changed how the apportionment factor is calculated. This resulted in a deferred state tax benefit of $4 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded on state attributes we do not expect to utilize before they expire.\nAs a result of the deemed mandatory repatriation tax requirement of the U.S. Tax Reform, we have taxed our undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, at reduced tax rates. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on business operations, we have determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. Therefore, as of December 31, 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $12 million ($10 million as December 31, 2018) for foreign withholding tax and various state income taxes associated with future repatriation of these earnings. This $2 million tax expense impacted the effective tax rate for 2019 ($10 million expense for 2018).\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2018, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impact the effective tax rate. We also recognized $3 million of tax benefits relating to 2018 law changes in Sweden and various U.S. states which favorably impacted our effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Reform significantly changed U.S. tax law for businesses by, among other things, lowering the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we completed our analysis, including currently available legislative updates, and recorded an additional tax benefit of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Of this benefit, $7 million related to adjustments to the deemed mandatory repatriation tax and $6 million related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATION\nOn January 7, 2021, we signed an agreement to sell our Personal Care business. Its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported earnings on discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $18 million (2019 - loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $1 million; 2018 - earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $2 million). For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 3, Discontinued Operations\u201d.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nUnder the Omnibus Plan, we may award to key employees and non-employee directors, at the discretion of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance-conditioned restricted stock units, performance share units, deferred share units ( DSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards. The non-employee directors only receive DSUs. We generally grant awards annually and use, when available, treasury stock to fulfill awards settled in common stock and options exercised.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation expense recognized in our results from continuing and discontinued operations was $7 million (2019 - $22 million) for all of the outstanding awards. Compensation costs not yet recognized amounted to $15 million (2019 - $16 million) and will be recognized over the remaining service period of approximately 14 months. The aggregate value of liability awards settled in 2020 was $6 million (2019 - $12 million). The total fair value of equity awards settled in 2020 was $6 million (2019 - $11 million), representing the fair value at the time of settlement. The fair value at the grant date for these settled equity awards was $7 million (2019 - $6 million). Compensation costs for performance awards are based on management's best estimate of the final performance measurement.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal cash requirements are for ongoing operating costs, pension contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt and income tax payments. We expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily with internally generated funds from our operations and, to the extent necessary, through borrowings under our $700 million credit facility, of which $646 million is currently undrawn and available, or through our $150 million receivables securitization facility, of which $111 million is currently undrawn and available. Under adverse market conditions, there can be no assurance that these agreements would be available or sufficient. See Capital Resources\u201d below.\nOur ability to make payments on the requirements mentioned above will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit and receivable securitization facilities and debt indentures impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities.\nA portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the foreign subsidiaries reflect full provision for local income taxes. The U.S. Tax Reform includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we recorded a provisional repatriation tax amount of $46 million in 2017 and adjusted by $7 million in 2018. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on the business operations, we have determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. We remain indefinitely reinvested in the outside basis differences of our foreign subsidiaries, except for our Personal Care business which we are selling. We do not anticipate any additional cash tax liability associated with repatriating the proceeds of the sale other than what is already provided.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flow requirements are primarily for salaries and benefits, the purchase of raw materials, including fiber and energy, and other expenses such as income tax and property taxes.\nCash flows from operating activities, including discontinued operations, totaled $411 million in 2020, a $31 million decrease compared to cash flows from operating activities of $442 million in 2019. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in profitability partially offset by an improvement in cash flow from working capital requirements. We received income tax refunds, net of payments, of $22 million in 2020 compared to income tax payments, net of refunds of $59 million in 2019. We paid $4 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contributions in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense in 2020 compared to 2019 when we paid $1 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contributions in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense when excluding our non-cash pension settlement loss of $30 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities, including discontinued operations, in 2020 amounted to $202 million, a $52 million decrease compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $254 million in 2019.\nThe use of cash in 2020 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $175 million and the acquisition of the Appvion Point of Sale Business in the second quarter of 2020 ($30 million).\nThe use of cash in 2019 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $255 million.\nOur annual capital expenditures for 2021 should increase due mostly to our Kingsport mill conversion and are expected to be between $310 million and $330 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided from financing activities, including discontinued operations, totaled $35 million in 2020 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $237 million in 2019.\nThe primary source of cash flows provided from financing activities was from proceeds of the term loan in 2020 ($300 million). This was partially offset by the decrease in borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivables securitization) ($135 million), the repurchase of our common stock ($59 million), dividend payments ($51 million) and a decrease in bank indebtedness ($10 million).\nThe use of cash in 2019 was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock ($219 million) and dividend payments ($110 million). This was partially offset by the net increase of borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivables securitization) ($85 million).\nCapital Resources\nNet indebtedness, consisting of bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $788 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $886 million as of December 31, 2019.\nTerm Loan\nOn May 5, 2020, we entered into a $300 million Term Loan Agreement that matures on May 5, 2025. We used borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement to repay other debt, to pay related fees and expenses. A mandatory repayment of $6 million was made in 2020. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 19 Long-Term Debt\u201d.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have an unsecured $700 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain domestic and foreign banks that matures on August 22, 2023.\nBorrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings by certain foreign subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company, our significant domestic subsidiaries and certain of our significant foreign subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR, EURIBOR, Canadian bankers' acceptance or prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin linked to our credit rating. In addition, we pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and events of default for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1 (or 4.00 to 1 upon the occurrence of certain qualifying material acquisitions). At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these financial covenants, and had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement (December 31, 2019- $80 million). At December 31, 2020, our interest coverage ratio was 8.2 and our leverage ratio was 1.9. At December 31, 2020, we had $54 million of outstanding letters of credit (December 31, 2019 - nil), leaving $646 million unused and available under this facility (December 31, 2019 - $620 million).\nReceivables Securitization\nWe have a $150 million receivables securitization facility that matures in November 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under the receivables securitization facility, and had no outstanding letters of credit under the program (December 31, 2019 - $55 million and $53 million, respectively). The program contains certain termination events, which include, but are not limited to, matters related to receivable performance, certain defaults occurring under the Credit Agreement or our failure to repay or satisfy material obligations. At December 31, 2020, we had $111 million unused and available under this facility.\nCommon Stock\nOn May 5, 2020, we suspended the distribution of our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program in light of current uncertainty in the global markets. Our stock repurchase program resumed on February 11, 2021. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our capital return program based upon customary considerations, including market conditions.\nDuring 2020, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share, to holders of our common stock. Total dividends aggregating $25 million were paid on April 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2020.\nDuring 2019, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.435 and three quarterly dividends of $0.455 per share, to holders of our common stock. Dividends aggregating $28 million, $28 million, $27 million and $26 million were paid on April 15, 2019, July 16, 2019, October 15, 2019 and January 15, 2020, respectively, to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2019, July 2, 2019, October 2, 2019 and January 2, 2020, respectively.\nGUARANTEES\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we offer indemnifications relating to the sale of our businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At December 31, 2020, we were unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded significant expenses in the past.\nPension Plans\nWe have indemnified and held harmless the trustees of our pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from us or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we do not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables provide our obligations and commitments at December 31, 2020:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> CONTRACT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> THEREAFTER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (excluding interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance leases and other (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term income taxes payable (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> COMMITMENT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> THEREAFTER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other commercial commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) In connection with the U.S. Tax Reform, we have remaining liabilities of $30 million in repatriation tax to pay through 2025.

Purchase orders in the normal course of business are excluded. \nIn addition, we expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $13 million to the pension plans in 2021 and a minimum total amount of $4 million in 2021 to the other post-retirement benefits plans.\nFor 2021 and the foreseeable future, we expect cash flows from operations and from our various sources of financing to be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations and commercial commitments.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES\nOur principal accounting policies are described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. Notes referenced in this section are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and choices amongst acceptable accounting methods that affect our reported results of operations and financial position. Critical accounting estimates pertain to matters that contain a significant level of management estimates about future events, encompass the most complex and subjective judgments and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental matters and asset retirement obligations, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, closure and restructuring costs, intangible assets impairment, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes and contingencies related to legal claims. These critical accounting estimates and policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe these accounting policies, and others as set forth in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, should be reviewed as they are essential to understanding our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEnvironmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe maintain provisions for estimated environmental costs when remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental provisions relate mainly to air emissions, effluent treatment, silvicultural activities and site remediation (together referred to as environmental matters\u201d). The environmental cost estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as contribution by other responsible parties. Additional information regarding environmental matters is available in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nWhile we believe that we have determined the costs for environmental matters likely to be incurred, based on known information, our ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with the properties may lead to future environmental investigations. These efforts may result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, environmental laws and regulations and interpretation by regulatory authorities could change which could result in significant changes to our estimates. For further details on Climate change regulation\u201d and other environmental matters refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nAsset retirement obligations are mainly associated with landfill operation and closure, dredging of settling ponds and bark pile management. We recognize asset retirement obligations, at fair value, in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset. The fair value is based on the expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes are considered. Probabilities are applied to each of the cash flow scenarios to arrive at an expected cash flow. The estimated cash flows are then discounted using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate in combination with business-specific and other relevant risks to discount the cash flow. The rates used vary between 4.7% and 12.0%.\nCash flow estimates incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value, whenever that information is available without undue cost and effort. If unavailable, assumptions are based on internal experts, third-party engineers' studies and historical experience in remediation work. As at December 31, 2020, we had an asset retirement obligation provision of $14 million for 12 locations (2019 - $13 million).\nAs at December 31, 2020, we had a total provision of $47 million for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations (2019 - $35 million). Certain of these amounts have been discounted due to more certainty of the timing of expenditures using the credit adjusted risk-free interest rate for the corresponding period until the settlement date. The rates used vary, based on the prevailing rate at the moment of recognition of the liability and on its settlement period. Additional costs, not known or identified, could be incurred for remediation efforts. Based on policies and procedures in place to monitor environmental exposure, management believes that such additional remediation costs would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, result of operations or cash flows.\nImpairment of Property Plant and Equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that, at the lowest level of determinable cash flows, the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Step I of the impairment test assesses if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted future cash flows in order to assess if the property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets are impaired. In the event the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the net book value of the assets, a Step II impairment test must be carried out to determine the impairment charge. In Step II, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Given that there is generally no readily available quoted value for our property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets, we determine fair value of our assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition, and by using the liquidation or salvage value in the case of idled assets. The fair value estimate in Step II is based on the undiscounted cash flows used in Step I.\nEstimates of undiscounted future cash flows used to test the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of use assets and definite-lived intangible assets includes key assumptions related to selling prices, inflation-adjusted cost projections, forecasted exchange rates (when applicable) and estimated useful life. Changes in our assumptions and estimates may affect our forecasts and may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required. In addition, actual results may vary from our forecasts, and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where our conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions.\nUseful Lives\nOn a regular basis, we review the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment and our definite-lived intangible assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets requires judgment and is based on currently available information. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business strategy, changes to our capital strategy or changes in regulation can result in useful lives differing from our estimates. Revisions to the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets constitute a change in accounting estimate and are dealt with prospectively by amending depreciation and amortization rates.\nA change in the remaining estimated useful life of a group of assets, or their estimated net salvage value, will affect the depreciation or amortization rate used to depreciate or amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation or amortization expense as reported in our results of operations. In 2020, we recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $223 million compared to $231 million in 2019. At December 31, 2020, we had property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $2,023 million (2019 - $2,223 million) and definite-lived intangible assets, net of amortization, of $19 million (2019 - $20 million).\nIn 2020, we recognized $136 million of accelerated depreciation, mostly related to our announced permanent closure of our uncoated freesheet manufacturing at Kingsport, Tennessee and Port Huron, Michigan mills, the remaining paper machine at the Ashdown, Arkansas mill and the converting center in Ridgefield, Tennessee.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we announced the permanent closure of two paper machines. These closures took place at our Ashdown, Arkansas pulp and paper mill and our Port Huron, Michigan paper mill. As a result, we recognized $32 million of accelerated depreciation in 2019.\nClosure and Restructuring Costs\nClosure and restructuring costs are recognized as liabilities in the period when they are incurred and are measured at their fair value. For such recognition to occur, management, with the appropriate level of authority, must have approved and committed to a firm plan\nand appropriate communication to those affected must have occurred. These provisions may require an estimation of costs such as severance and termination benefits, pension and related curtailments, environmental remediation and may also include expenses related to demolition and outplacement. Actions taken may also require an evaluation of any remaining assets to determine required impairments, if any, and a review of estimated remaining useful lives which may lead to accelerated depreciation expense.\nEstimates of cash flows and fair value relating to closures and restructuring require judgment. Closure and restructuring liabilities are based on management's best estimates of future events. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may differ from these estimates due to subsequent business developments. As such, additional costs and further impairment charges may be required in future periods.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $34 million of severance and termination costs, $31 million of inventory obsolescence and $34 million of other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $32 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets and $1 million of accelerated depreciation under Depreciation and amortization, on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $3 million of severance and termination costs, $4 million of inventory obsolescence and $2 million of other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs in relation to the paper machine closures. Concurrently, with the Ashdown paper machine closure and related workforce reduction, management negotiated a voluntary early retirement program to reduce costs and put the mill in a stronger cost position in the long-term. We additionally recorded $13 million of severance and termination costs under Closure and restructuring costs.\nAdditional information can be found under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of license rights ($6 million) and water rights ($4 million). We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the asset level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are evaluated at the beginning of the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. In connection with the Company's annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment for each indefinite-lived intangible asset (license rights and water rights). The qualitative assessments performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated that the indefinite-lived intangible assets had fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts.\nPension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWe have several defined contribution plans and multiemployer plans. The pension expense under these plans is equal to our contribution. Defined contribution pension expense was $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $39 million).\nWe sponsor both contributory and non-contributory U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor a number of other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees; the plans are unfunded and include life insurance programs and medical and dental benefits. In addition, we provide supplemental unfunded defined benefit pension plans and supplemental unfunded defined contribution pension plans to certain senior management employees.\nWe account for pensions and other post-retirement benefits in accordance with Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board-Accounting Standards Committee which requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and other post-retirement benefit charges require assumptions in order to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations. These assumptions require considerable management judgment and include:\n - Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets - used to estimate the growth and expected return on assets \n - Discount rate - used to determine interest costs and the net present value of our obligations \n - Rate of compensation increase - used to calculate the impact of future increases on our obligations \n - Health care cost trends - used to calculate the impact of future health care costs on our obligations \n - Employee related factors, such as mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and disabilities - used to determine the extent of our obligations \nChanges in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are amortized over the expected average remaining service life of the active employee group covered by the plans, only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess\nof 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market value of assets, over the average remaining service period of approximately ten years of the active employee group covered by the pension plans, and 12 years of the active employee group covered by the other post-retirement benefits plans.\nAn expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.6% was considered appropriate by management for the determination of pension expense for 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, we will use 4.4% as the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the current view of long-term investment returns. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on management's best estimate of the long-term returns of the major asset classes (cash and cash equivalents, equities and bonds) weighted by the target allocation of assets at the measurement date, net of expenses. This rate includes an equity risk premium over government bond returns for equity investments and a value-added premium for the contribution to returns from active management. The sources used to determine management's best estimate of long-term returns are numerous and include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country-specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts' or governments' expectations, as applicable.\nWe set our discount rate assumption annually to reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed income debt instruments, with a duration that is expected to match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. High-quality debt instruments are corporate bonds with a rating of AA or better. The discount rates at December 31, 2020 for pension plans were estimated at 2.5% for the projected benefit obligation and 3.0% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2020 and for post-retirement benefit plans were estimated at 2.5% for the projected benefit obligation and 3.0% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2020.\nWe used a full yield curve approach to estimate the current service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for Canadian pension plans and U.S. funded pension plans. The estimate of these components is made by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We used this approach to provide a more precise measurement of current service and interest cost components by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.\nThe rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption in the actuarial model for pension (set at 2.7% for the projected benefit obligation and 2.8% for the net periodic benefit cost) and for post-retirement benefit plans (set at 2.8% for the projected benefit obligation and 2.7% for the net periodic benefit cost) and is determined based upon our long-term plans for such increases.\nFor employee related factors, mortality rate tables tailored to our industry were used and the other factors reflect our historical experience and management's best estimate regarding future expectations.\nFor measurement purposes, a 3.9% weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2020.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the key weighted average economic assumptions used in measuring the projected pension benefit obligation, the accrued other post-retirement benefit obligation and related net periodic benefit cost for 2020. The sensitivity analysis should be used with caution as it is hypothetical and changes in each key assumption may not be linear. The sensitivities in each key variable have been calculated independently of each other.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other Post-Retirement Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected rate of return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (189\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually the amount required to provide for benefits earned in the year and to fund solvency deficiencies, funding shortfalls and past service obligations over periods not exceeding those permitted by the applicable regulatory authorities. Past service obligations primarily arise from improvements to plan benefits. The other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded and contributions are made annually to cover benefit payments.\nWe expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $13 million in 2021 compared to $15 million in 2020 (2019 - $17 million) to the pension plans. We expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $4 million in 2021 compared to $4 million in 2020 to the other post-retirement benefit plans (2019 - $4 million).\nBenefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 for our pension and post-retirement plans were are follows:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> post-retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> post-retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected benefit obligation at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,566\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,425\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of assets at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional details on our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, refer to Note 7 Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\u201d.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined according to differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. The change in the net deferred tax asset or liability is included in earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the years in which assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these years, a projection of taxable income and an assumption of the ultimate recovery or settlement period for temporary differences are required. The projection of future taxable income is based on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\nWe assess the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and, if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on these taxable income projections, a valuation allowance is recorded. In general, realization\u201d refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or an increase in future taxes refundable from the deferred tax assets. Evaluating the need for an amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment. All available evidence, both positive and negative, should be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. In our evaluation process, we give the most weight to historical income or losses. After evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, although realization is not assured, we determined that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, with the exception of certain state credits and losses for which a valuation allowance of $13 million exists at December 31, 2020, the tax basis difference in our assets held of sale (U.S. and foreign) for which a valuation allowance of $44 million exists at December 31, 2020, and certain foreign loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance of $7 million exists at December 31, 2020. Of this amount, $47 million unfavorably impacted tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2020 (2019 -$5 million).\nOur deferred tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to various accruals, accounting provisions, pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, and available tax credits. Our deferred tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences pertaining to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, leases and other items. Estimating the ultimate settlement period requires judgment. The reversal of timing differences is expected at enacted tax rates, which could change due to changes in income tax laws or the introduction of tax changes through the presentation of annual budgets by different governments. As a result, a change in the timing and the income tax rate at which the components will reverse could materially affect deferred tax expense in our future results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities. To the best of our knowledge, we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law. In accordance with Income Taxes Topic of FASB ASC 740, we evaluate new tax positions that result in a tax benefit to us and determine the amount of tax benefits that can be recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if changes in recognition or classification are necessary. Significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected within the next 12 months are disclosed quarterly. Future\nrecognition of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate in the period the benefits are recognized. At December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $23 million (2019 - $28 million). These amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were sustained, such as federal deduction that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained. As of December 31, 2020, we believe it is reasonably possible that up to $4 million of our unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized in 2021, which could impact the effective tax rate. However, the amount and timing of the recognition of these benefits is subject to some uncertainty. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporation multinationals, such as the U.S. Tax Reform, enacted in 2017. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Reform that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially impact our financial results.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities.\nTax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law, and we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further details refer to Note 10 Income Taxes\u201d.\nContingencies related to legal claims\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, under the risk Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results or condition\u201d and in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount is reasonably estimable. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of the then available facts with respect to each matter. When no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. For further details on Contingencies\u201d and legal claims refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with Domtar Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements.

Except where otherwise indicated, all financial information reflected herein is determined on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThe information contained on our website, www.domtar.com, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should in no way be construed as a part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.\nIn accordance with industry practice, in this report, the term ton\u201d or the symbol ST\u201d refers to a short ton, an imperial unit of measurement equal to 0.9072 metric tons. The term metric ton\u201d or the symbol ADMT\u201d refers to an air dry metric ton. In this report, unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, and the term dollars\u201d and the symbol $\u201d refer to U.S. dollars. In the following discussion, unless otherwise noted, references to increases or decreases in income and expense items, prices, contribution to net earnings (loss), and shipment volumes are based on the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The twelve month periods are also referred to as 2020, 2019 and 2018. References to notes refer to footnotes to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThis MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and outlook. Topics discussed and analyzed include:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 2020 Highlights \n \u2022 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Outlook \n \u2022 Cost Reduction Program \n \u2022 Review of Continuing Operations \n \u2022 Discontinued Operations of our Personal Care Business \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies \nFor a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, other than Results of Operations\u201d, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\nSale of Personal Care Business\nOn January 7, 2021, we agreed to sell our Personal Care business to American Industrial Partners ( AIP\u201d), for a purchase price of $920 million in cash (the Transaction\u201d). The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Based on its magnitude and because we are exiting the Personal Care business, the sale represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all periods presented reflect the Personal Care business as a discontinued operation. Our Personal Care business was previously disclosed as a separate reportable segment. For more information on our discontinued operations, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 3, Discontinued Operations\u201d.\nPurchase of Appvion Point of Sale Business\nOn April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Point of Sale paper business from Appvion Operations Inc. The business includes the coater and related equipment located at Appvion's West Carrollton, Ohio, facility as well as a license for all corresponding intellectual property and assumed liabilities related to post-retirement benefits. The results of this business have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of April 27, 2020 and are presented in the Pulp and Paper business. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 4 Acquisition of Business\u201d.\nChange in Reporting for EAM Corporation\nStarting January 1, 2020, as a result of changes in our organizational structure, EAM Corporation, a manufacturer of high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores, previously reported under our former Personal Care segment is now presented under our Pulp and Paper business. Prior period results have been restated to the new presentation with no significant impact on results. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 24 Segment Disclosures\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nFollowing our agreement to sell our Personal Care business, we now operate as a single reportable segment as described below, which also represents our only operating segment.\nPulp and Paper: Our Pulp and Paper business consists of the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of communication, specialty and packaging papers, as well as softwood, hardwood and fluff pulps and high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores.\nOur segment measure of profit (operating income (loss) from continuing operations) is used by management to evaluate performance and make operational decisions. Management believes that this measure allows for a better understanding of cost trends, operating efficiencies, prices and volume. Business segment operating income (loss) is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity losses, excluding corporate items, interest expense, net, and non-service components of net periodic benefit cost. Corporate expenses are allocated to our segment with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under Corporate\u201d and do not allocate to the segment.\n2020 HIGHLIGHTS\n \u2022 We reported an operating loss of $177 million, compared to operating income of $179 million in 2019 \n \u2022 We reported a loss from continuing operations of $145 million compared to earnings from continuing operations of $85 million in 2019 \n \u2022 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes amounted to $18 million in 2020, including a loss on classification as held for sale, net of tax, of $45 million \n \u2022 Sales decreased by 16% from 2019. Net average selling prices for pulp and paper were down from 2019. Our manufactured paper volume was down while our pulp volume was up when compared to 2019 \n \u2022 Recognition of closure and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets, of $99 million and $136 million, respectively, mostly related to our announced cost reduction program \n \u2022 Recognition of $36 million (CDN $48 million) from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ( CEWS\u201d) and received a $7 million payment from waiving the non-production clause related to the sale agreement of our Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon kraft pulp mill in 2012 \n \u2022 We repurchased $59 million of our common stock and paid $51 million in dividends. Our capital return program, which includes our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program, was suspended in the second quarter of 2020. On February 11, 2021, we announced that we will resume our stock repurchase program \n\n\n (a) Includes closure and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets related to our announced cost reduction program of $96 million and $136 million, respectively as well as closure and restructuring charges of $3 million under Corporate in 2020. In 2019, we recognized closure and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets of $22 million and $32 million, respectively associated with our decision to permanently close two paper machines. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d for more information. In 2018, we did not recognize any closure and restructuring charges or impairment of long-lived assets. \n (b) See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 6 \"Earnings (Loss) per Common Share\" for more information on the calculation of net earnings per common share. \nIMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nWith the unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world due to the pandemic, this virus has had a profound impact on human health, the global economy and society in general. We are actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it is impacting our employees, operations, customers, suppliers, liquidity and capital resources.\nOur operations are considered to be essential services in the jurisdictions where we operate. Certain of our paper products are used in the testing for COVID-19 as well as for personal protection medical gowns. However, demand for our paper has declined significantly since the beginning of April, largely due to work-from-home rules and the overall economic slowdown. The length and severity of the reduction in paper demand is uncertain; at the current time, we expect the adverse impact to continue through the first quarter of 2021. Beyond the first quarter of 2021, paper demand will depend largely on when, and the extent to which, work-from-home subsides and on the timing of the return to normal global economic activities.\nEffects from COVID-19 began for us at the end of the first quarter of 2020 but were not material to the three-month's results ended March 31, 2020. Shipments of paper were lower by approximately 19% in 2020 when compared to 2019. As a result of the decrease in demand, on August 7, 2020, we announced the permanent closure of the uncoated freesheet manufacturing at our Kingsport, Tennessee and Port Huron, Michigan mills, the remaining paper machine at our Ashdown, Arkansas mill and the converting center in Ridgefields, Tennessee. These actions reduced our annual uncoated freesheet paper capacity by approximately 721,000 short tons, and resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 750 employees. The Kingsport and Ashdown paper machines, which have been idled since April 2020, did not recommence operations. Our Ridgefields converting center ceased operations at the end of the third quarter of 2020, while our Port Huron mill is expected to shut down by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\nOur pulp shipments were higher by approximately 7% in 2020 when compared to 2019. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China.\nBelow we further describe specific impacts and the measures we have taken since March 2020.\nHealth and Safety of our Employees\nThe safety of our employees continues to be our primary focus. As COVID-19 has evolved, we have taken numerous steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, including: social distancing, providing personnel protection and thermal scanning, health monitoring, contact tracing and enhanced cleaning measures. In addition, we implemented travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely.\nOperations and Supply Chain\nWe continue to operate in compliance with the orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities in each of our locations, and we are working with our customers to meet their specific shipment needs. We continue to place a priority on business continuity and contingency planning, including potential planning for extended closures of any key facilities, whether because of government action or workforce disruption, or because of disruptions related to our key suppliers that might arise related to COVID-19. At this point, we have experienced only minor disruptions. We are actively monitoring our supply chain, and we may experience disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impacts or timing of those events, nor can we reasonably estimate our ability to mitigate such impacts.\nCost Reduction Program\nOn August 7, 2020 we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. The cost saving initiatives includes capacity reduction and asset closures (noted above), mill-level cost savings and rightsizing of support functions. See Cost Reduction Program below for more information on this program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have taken actions and may take other actions, intended to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the current uncertainty in the global markets. On May 5, 2020, we entered into a five-year $300 million term loan. We suspended our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program in 2020 and on February 11, 2021, we announced that we would resume our stock repurchase program. In addition, we completed a review of all planned capital expenditures for 2020 and reduced or delayed spending without compromising on safety or regulatory compliance. Our capital expenditures for 2020 were $175 million, a decrease of approximately $75 million compared to our planned spending.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe U.S. and Canadian governments have launched several support programs to provide assistance to companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to review the details of the various programs to determine whether we might qualify.\nThe Government of Canada created the CEWS to provide financial support for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent large layoffs. CEWS allows eligible entities to receive a subsidy retroactive to March 15, 2020. We qualified and applied for all periods identified under CEWS, from March 15 through December 31, 2020 and recognized $36 million (CDN $48 million) of income related to this subsidy in 2020.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2021, paper demand remains uncertain and dependent upon the COVID-19 recovery, in particular quarantine measures impacting the return to office and school. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China. Overall raw material costs are expected to moderately increase and freight costs are also expected to be higher.\nCOST REDUCTION PROGRAM\nOn August 7, 2020, we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program, targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. The costs saving initiatives include capacity reduction and asset closures, mill-level cost savings and rightsizing support functions. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve cross-functional collaboration, leveraging more efficient business processes.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $34 million of severance and termination costs, $31 million of inventory obsolescence, $12 million of environmental costs, $4 million of pension curtailment and settlement charges and $18 million of licenses fees, write-offs and other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nKingsport, Tennessee mill\nWe plan to enter the linerboard market with the conversion of our Kingsport paper machine. Once in full operation, the mill will produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing adjacent market. The conversion is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\nWe estimate the conversion cost to be between $300 and $350 million. Once fully operational, the mill is expected to be a low-cost, first quartile recycled linerboard mill in North America. The converted mill is expected to directly employ approximately 160 employees.\nAshdown, Arkansas mill\nWe will complete the conversion of our Ashdown mill to 100% softwood and fluff pulp, which will require $15 to $20 million of capital investments and is expected to be completed in early 2021. The mill will produce additional market hardwood pulp until it converts the fiberline to softwood pulp. The conversion of the fiberline to 100% softwood is also necessary for an eventual expansion into containerboard. Following the fiberline conversion, Ashdown will have annual production capacity of 775,000 tons of fluff and softwood pulp. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d for more information.\nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents a discussion and analysis of our 2020, 2019 and 2018 sales, operating (loss) income and other information relevant to the understanding of our results from continuing operations.\nEAM's results of operations, previously reported under our former Personal Care segment, are now presented under our Pulp and Paper business with no significant impact on our results. Prior period results have been restated to the new presentation.\n\n\nSales in 2020 decreased by $717 million, or 16% when compared to sales in 2019. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a decrease in our paper sales volumes and a decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in pulp sales volumes.\nSales in 2019 decreased by $196 million, or 4% when compared to sales in 2018. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a decrease in our paper sales volumes and a decrease in net average selling price for pulp. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net average selling price for paper as well as an increase in our pulp sales volumes.\nANALYSIS of CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\n\n (a) Includes raw materials (such as fiber and chemicals) and energy costs. \n (b) Includes maintenance, freight costs, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses and other costs. \n (c) Depreciation charges were lower by $7 million in 2020, excluding foreign currency impact. In 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets related to our cost reduction program. In 2019, we recorded $32 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets related to our decision to permanently close two paper machines. \n (d) 2020 restructuring charges relate to:2019 restructuring charges relate to: \n\n (e) 2020 other operating expenses/income includes:2019 other operating expenses/income includes: \n\nOperating loss in our Pulp and Paper business amounted to ($143) million in 2020, a decrease in income of $369 million, when compared to operating income of $226 million in 2019. Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Lower net average selling prices for pulp and paper ($208 million) \n \u2022 Lower volume/ mix ($125 million) mostly related to lower volume of paper, partially offset by higher volume of pulp \n \u2022 Higher depreciation/impairment charges ($97 million). We recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets, related to our cost reduction program in 2020 compared to $32 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets, related to our decision to permanently close two paper machines in 2019. Depreciation charges were lower by $7 million when compared to 2019 \n \u2022 Higher restructuring charges ($74 million) in 2020 as a result of the cost reduction program ($96 million) compared to the decision to permanently close two paper machines in 2019 ($22 million) \nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 Lower input costs ($77 million) mostly related to lower cost of fiber, due in part to better weather and favorable market conditions compared to 2019 \n \u2022 Lower operating expenses ($37 million) mostly due to lower maintenance and other costs due to our cash conservation initiatives (including our cost reduction program) in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and amounts recognized from the CEWS when compared to 2019, partially offset by lower production \n \u2022 Higher other income ($11 million) \n \u2022 Positive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our Canadian denominated expenses, net of our hedging program ($10 million) \nOTHER FACTORS\nCorporate\nWe incurred $34 million of corporate charges in 2020, a decrease of $13 million compared to corporate charges of $47 million in 2019. This decrease was mostly due to lower SG&A expenses and partially offset by an increase in restructuring expenses, both as a result of the cost reduction program.\nInterest Expense, net\nWe incurred $58 million of net interest expense in 2020, an increase of $6 million compared to net interest expense of $52 million in 2019. The net interest expense was impacted by the $300 million Term Loan entered into on May 5, 2020 as well as an increase in borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $76 million in 2020 compared to an income tax expense of $17 million in 2019, which yielded an effective tax rate of 35% and 16% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn January 7, 2021, we agreed to sell our Personal Care business to American Industrial Partners (AIP) for $920 million. As such, for the December 31, 2020 reporting period, we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in that business and have classified our investment in that business as held for sale. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $51 million for the difference between the net book value of the business and the tax basis of that business which impacted the effective tax rate in 2020.\nWe have assessed the value of the deferred tax asset related to the book/tax basis difference, which is expected to be a capital loss for tax purposes upon the completion of the sale and determined that we are not likely to realize a full benefit from the asset. As such, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $44 million associated with this deferred tax asset. During the year, we also analyzed our existing Arkansas research and development credits and determined an additional valuation allowance of $3 million should be recorded since it is expected these credits will expire un-utilized. These amounts unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020.\nDuring 2020, we generated a U.S. tax net operating loss which, in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act will be carried back to 2015. In 2015, the US federal tax rate was 35%, versus the current rate of 21%. Therefore, we recorded an additional tax benefit of $5 million related to the tax rate benefit of the loss which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020. We also recorded $17 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2020. Since we have a tax loss in 2020, the tax credits will be carried forward and are expected to be utilized in future years.\nAs a result of the deemed mandatory repatriation tax requirement of the U.S. Tax Reform, we have taxed our undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, at reduced tax rates. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on our business operations, we had determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. As such, as of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million ($12 million as of December 31, 2019) for foreign withholding tax and various state income taxes associated with future repatriation of these earnings. This additional $1 million tax benefit impacted the effective tax rate for 2020 ($2 million tax expense for 2019).\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2019, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Arkansas legislation changes were passed in 2019 which reduced the state tax rate and changed how the apportionment factor is calculated. This resulted in a deferred state tax benefit of $4 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded in 2019 on state attributes we do not expect to utilize before they expire.\nEconomic conditions and uncertainties\nThe markets in which our pulp and paper business operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers. Most of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers as well. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand. We also compete on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering and service solutions. Further, we compete against electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As a result of such competition, we are experiencing ongoing decreasing demand for most of our existing paper products. In addition, current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement.\nThe pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the basis of access to low-cost wood fiber, product quality and competitively priced pulp products.\nThe high degree of uncertainty and volatility day-to-day and the longer-term potential impacts of the economic slowdown remain unclear. In 2021, paper demand remains uncertain and dependent upon the COVID-19 recovery, in particular quarantine measures impacting the return to office and school. We expect near-term pulp markets to gradually improve driven by better demand, maintenance outages and restocking in China. Overall raw material costs are expected to moderately increase and freight costs are also expected to be higher.\n\n (a) Includes raw materials (such as fiber and chemicals) and energy costs. \n (b) Includes maintenance, freight costs, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses and other costs. \n (c) Depreciation charges were lower by $9 million in 2019, excluding foreign currency impact. We recorded $32 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets related to our decision to permanently close two paper machines (2018 - nil). \n (d) 2019 restructuring charges relates to:2018 restructuring charges relates to: \n\n (e) 2019 other operating expenses/income includes:2018 other operating expenses/income includes: \n\nOperating income in our Pulp and Paper business amounted to $226 million in 2019, a decrease of $216 million, when compared to operating income of $442 million in 2018. Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Higher operating expenses ($128 million) mostly due to lower production as well as higher maintenance and fixed costs due to timing of major maintenance \n \u2022 Higher input costs ($46 million) mostly related to higher costs of fiber due mostly to severe weather conditions as well as unfavorable market conditions, partially offset by lower costs of chemicals and energy \n \u2022 Lower volume and mix ($46 million) mostly related to lower volume of paper, partially offset by higher volume of pulp \n \u2022 Higher depreciation/impairment charges ($23 million) mostly due to our decision to permanently close two paper machines in 2019 \n \u2022 Higher restructuring charges ($22 million) due to our decision to permanently close two paper machines in 2019 \n \u2022 Higher other income/expense ($11 million) \nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 Higher average selling prices for paper partially offset by lower average selling prices for pulp ($52 million) \n \u2022 Positive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our Canadian denominated expenses, net of our hedging program ($8 million) \nOur Espanola pulp and specialty paper mill underwent an extensive audit and inspection of major components during its outage in June 2019. Following the inspection and given the cyclically low pulp prices, we made the decision to fast-track some maintenance work that was originally planned for 2020 in order to address some reliability risks. This extended shutdown impacted mostly our second half of 2019 by adding approximately $36 million of maintenance costs and lowering our total production by approximately 60,000 tonnes.\nOTHER FACTORS\nCorporate\nWe incurred $47 million of corporate charges in both 2019 and 2018. Corporates charges decreased mostly due to a decrease in environmental provision and was offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\nInterest expense, net\nWe incurred $52 million of net interest expense in 2019, a decrease of $10 million compared to net interest expense of $62 million in 2018. The net interest expense was impacted by the repayment of the $300 million Term Loan in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $17 million in 2019 compared to an income tax expense of $68 million in 2018, which yielded an effective tax rate of 16% and 19% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2019, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Arkansas legislation changes were passed in 2019 which reduced the state tax rate and changed how the apportionment factor is calculated. This resulted in a deferred state tax benefit of $4 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded on state attributes we do not expect to utilize before they expire.\nAs a result of the deemed mandatory repatriation tax requirement of the U.S. Tax Reform, we have taxed our undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, at reduced tax rates. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on business operations, we have determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. Therefore, as of December 31, 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $12 million ($10 million as December 31, 2018) for foreign withholding tax and various state income taxes associated with future repatriation of these earnings. This $2 million tax expense impacted the effective tax rate for 2019 ($10 million expense for 2018).\nWe recorded $18 million of tax credits in 2018, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impact the effective tax rate. We also recognized $3 million of tax benefits relating to 2018 law changes in Sweden and various U.S. states which favorably impacted our effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Reform significantly changed U.S. tax law for businesses by, among other things, lowering the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we completed our analysis, including currently available legislative updates, and recorded an additional tax benefit of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Of this benefit, $7 million related to adjustments to the deemed mandatory repatriation tax and $6 million related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATION\nOn January 7, 2021, we signed an agreement to sell our Personal Care business. Its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported earnings on discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $18 million (2019 - loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $1 million; 2018 - earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $2 million). For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 3, Discontinued Operations\u201d.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nUnder the Omnibus Plan, we may award to key employees and non-employee directors, at the discretion of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance-conditioned restricted stock units, performance share units, deferred share units ( DSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards. The non-employee directors only receive DSUs. We generally grant awards annually and use, when available, treasury stock to fulfill awards settled in common stock and options exercised.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation expense recognized in our results from continuing and discontinued operations was $7 million (2019 - $22 million) for all of the outstanding awards. Compensation costs not yet recognized amounted to $15 million (2019 - $16 million) and will be recognized over the remaining service period of approximately 14 months. The aggregate value of liability awards settled in 2020 was $6 million (2019 - $12 million). The total fair value of equity awards settled in 2020 was $6 million (2019 - $11 million), representing the fair value at the time of settlement. The fair value at the grant date for these settled equity awards was $7 million (2019 - $6 million). Compensation costs for performance awards are based on management's best estimate of the final performance measurement.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal cash requirements are for ongoing operating costs, pension contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt and income tax payments. We expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily with internally generated funds from our operations and, to the extent necessary, through borrowings under our $700 million credit facility, of which $646 million is currently undrawn and available, or through our $150 million receivables securitization facility, of which $111 million is currently undrawn and available. Under adverse market conditions, there can be no assurance that these agreements would be available or sufficient. See Capital Resources\u201d below.\nOur ability to make payments on the requirements mentioned above will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit and receivable securitization facilities and debt indentures impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities.\nA portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the foreign subsidiaries reflect full provision for local income taxes. The U.S. Tax Reform includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we recorded a provisional repatriation tax amount of $46 million in 2017 and adjusted by $7 million in 2018. After completing our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Reform's impact on the business operations, we have determined that we are no longer indefinitely reinvested in these undistributed foreign earnings as well as foreign earnings after December 31, 2017. We remain indefinitely reinvested in the outside basis differences of our foreign subsidiaries, except for our Personal Care business which we are selling. We do not anticipate any additional cash tax liability associated with repatriating the proceeds of the sale other than what is already provided.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flow requirements are primarily for salaries and benefits, the purchase of raw materials, including fiber and energy, and other expenses such as income tax and property taxes.\nCash flows from operating activities, including discontinued operations, totaled $411 million in 2020, a $31 million decrease compared to cash flows from operating activities of $442 million in 2019. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in profitability partially offset by an improvement in cash flow from working capital requirements. We received income tax refunds, net of payments, of $22 million in 2020 compared to income tax payments, net of refunds of $59 million in 2019. We paid $4 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contributions in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense in 2020 compared to 2019 when we paid $1 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contributions in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense when excluding our non-cash pension settlement loss of $30 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities, including discontinued operations, in 2020 amounted to $202 million, a $52 million decrease compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $254 million in 2019.\nThe use of cash in 2020 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $175 million and the acquisition of the Appvion Point of Sale Business in the second quarter of 2020 ($30 million).\nThe use of cash in 2019 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $255 million.\nOur annual capital expenditures for 2021 should increase due mostly to our Kingsport mill conversion and are expected to be between $310 million and $330 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided from financing activities, including discontinued operations, totaled $35 million in 2020 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $237 million in 2019.\nThe primary source of cash flows provided from financing activities was from proceeds of the term loan in 2020 ($300 million). This was partially offset by the decrease in borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivables securitization) ($135 million), the repurchase of our common stock ($59 million), dividend payments ($51 million) and a decrease in bank indebtedness ($10 million).\nThe use of cash in 2019 was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock ($219 million) and dividend payments ($110 million). This was partially offset by the net increase of borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivables securitization) ($85 million).\nCapital Resources\nNet indebtedness, consisting of bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $788 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $886 million as of December 31, 2019.\nTerm Loan\nOn May 5, 2020, we entered into a $300 million Term Loan Agreement that matures on May 5, 2025. We used borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement to repay other debt, to pay related fees and expenses. A mandatory repayment of $6 million was made in 2020. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, under Note 19 Long-Term Debt\u201d.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have an unsecured $700 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain domestic and foreign banks that matures on August 22, 2023.\nBorrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings by certain foreign subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company, our significant domestic subsidiaries and certain of our significant foreign subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR, EURIBOR, Canadian bankers' acceptance or prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin linked to our credit rating. In addition, we pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and events of default for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1 (or 4.00 to 1 upon the occurrence of certain qualifying material acquisitions). At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these financial covenants, and had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement (December 31, 2019- $80 million). At December 31, 2020, our interest coverage ratio was 8.2 and our leverage ratio was 1.9. At December 31, 2020, we had $54 million of outstanding letters of credit (December 31, 2019 - nil), leaving $646 million unused and available under this facility (December 31, 2019 - $620 million).\nReceivables Securitization\nWe have a $150 million receivables securitization facility that matures in November 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under the receivables securitization facility, and had no outstanding letters of credit under the program (December 31, 2019 - $55 million and $53 million, respectively). The program contains certain termination events, which include, but are not limited to, matters related to receivable performance, certain defaults occurring under the Credit Agreement or our failure to repay or satisfy material obligations. At December 31, 2020, we had $111 million unused and available under this facility.\nCommon Stock\nOn May 5, 2020, we suspended the distribution of our regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program in light of current uncertainty in the global markets. Our stock repurchase program resumed on February 11, 2021. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our capital return program based upon customary considerations, including market conditions.\nDuring 2020, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share, to holders of our common stock. Total dividends aggregating $25 million were paid on April 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2020.\nDuring 2019, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.435 and three quarterly dividends of $0.455 per share, to holders of our common stock. Dividends aggregating $28 million, $28 million, $27 million and $26 million were paid on April 15, 2019, July 16, 2019, October 15, 2019 and January 15, 2020, respectively, to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2019, July 2, 2019, October 2, 2019 and January 2, 2020, respectively.\nGUARANTEES\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we offer indemnifications relating to the sale of our businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At December 31, 2020, we were unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded significant expenses in the past.\nPension Plans\nWe have indemnified and held harmless the trustees of our pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from us or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we do not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables provide our obligations and commitments at December 31, 2020:\n\n\n (1) In connection with the U.S. Tax Reform, we have remaining liabilities of $30 million in repatriation tax to pay through 2025. See Note 10 Income Taxes\u201d for additional information on the U.S. Tax Reform. \n (2) Includes commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment, roundwood, wood chips, gas and certain chemicals. Purchase orders in the normal course of business are excluded. \nIn addition, we expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $13 million to the pension plans in 2021 and a minimum total amount of $4 million in 2021 to the other post-retirement benefits plans.\nFor 2021 and the foreseeable future, we expect cash flows from operations and from our various sources of financing to be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations and commercial commitments.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES\nOur principal accounting policies are described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. Notes referenced in this section are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and choices amongst acceptable accounting methods that affect our reported results of operations and financial position. Critical accounting estimates pertain to matters that contain a significant level of management estimates about future events, encompass the most complex and subjective judgments and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental matters and asset retirement obligations, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, closure and restructuring costs, intangible assets impairment, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes and contingencies related to legal claims. These critical accounting estimates and policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe these accounting policies, and others as set forth in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, should be reviewed as they are essential to understanding our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEnvironmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe maintain provisions for estimated environmental costs when remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental provisions relate mainly to air emissions, effluent treatment, silvicultural activities and site remediation (together referred to as environmental matters\u201d). The environmental cost estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as contribution by other responsible parties. Additional information regarding environmental matters is available in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nWhile we believe that we have determined the costs for environmental matters likely to be incurred, based on known information, our ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with the properties may lead to future environmental investigations. These efforts may result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, environmental laws and regulations and interpretation by regulatory authorities could change which could result in significant changes to our estimates. For further details on Climate change regulation\u201d and other environmental matters refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nAsset retirement obligations are mainly associated with landfill operation and closure, dredging of settling ponds and bark pile management. We recognize asset retirement obligations, at fair value, in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset. The fair value is based on the expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes are considered. Probabilities are applied to each of the cash flow scenarios to arrive at an expected cash flow. The estimated cash flows are then discounted using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate in combination with business-specific and other relevant risks to discount the cash flow. The rates used vary between 4.7% and 12.0%.\nCash flow estimates incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value, whenever that information is available without undue cost and effort. If unavailable, assumptions are based on internal experts, third-party engineers' studies and historical experience in remediation work. As at December 31, 2020, we had an asset retirement obligation provision of $14 million for 12 locations (2019 - $13 million).\nAs at December 31, 2020, we had a total provision of $47 million for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations (2019 - $35 million). Certain of these amounts have been discounted due to more certainty of the timing of expenditures using the credit adjusted risk-free interest rate for the corresponding period until the settlement date. The rates used vary, based on the prevailing rate at the moment of recognition of the liability and on its settlement period. Additional costs, not known or identified, could be incurred for remediation efforts. Based on policies and procedures in place to monitor environmental exposure, management believes that such additional remediation costs would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, result of operations or cash flows.\nImpairment of Property Plant and Equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that, at the lowest level of determinable cash flows, the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Step I of the impairment test assesses if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted future cash flows in order to assess if the property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets are impaired. In the event the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the net book value of the assets, a Step II impairment test must be carried out to determine the impairment charge. In Step II, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Given that there is generally no readily available quoted value for our property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets, we determine fair value of our assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition, and by using the liquidation or salvage value in the case of idled assets. The fair value estimate in Step II is based on the undiscounted cash flows used in Step I.\nEstimates of undiscounted future cash flows used to test the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of use assets and definite-lived intangible assets includes key assumptions related to selling prices, inflation-adjusted cost projections, forecasted exchange rates (when applicable) and estimated useful life. Changes in our assumptions and estimates may affect our forecasts and may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required. In addition, actual results may vary from our forecasts, and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where our conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions.\nUseful Lives\nOn a regular basis, we review the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment and our definite-lived intangible assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets requires judgment and is based on currently available information. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business strategy, changes to our capital strategy or changes in regulation can result in useful lives differing from our estimates. Revisions to the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets constitute a change in accounting estimate and are dealt with prospectively by amending depreciation and amortization rates.\nA change in the remaining estimated useful life of a group of assets, or their estimated net salvage value, will affect the depreciation or amortization rate used to depreciate or amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation or amortization expense as reported in our results of operations. In 2020, we recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $223 million compared to $231 million in 2019. At December 31, 2020, we had property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $2,023 million (2019 - $2,223 million) and definite-lived intangible assets, net of amortization, of $19 million (2019 - $20 million).\nIn 2020, we recognized $136 million of accelerated depreciation, mostly related to our announced permanent closure of our uncoated freesheet manufacturing at Kingsport, Tennessee and Port Huron, Michigan mills, the remaining paper machine at the Ashdown, Arkansas mill and the converting center in Ridgefield, Tennessee.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we announced the permanent closure of two paper machines. These closures took place at our Ashdown, Arkansas pulp and paper mill and our Port Huron, Michigan paper mill. As a result, we recognized $32 million of accelerated depreciation in 2019.\nClosure and Restructuring Costs\nClosure and restructuring costs are recognized as liabilities in the period when they are incurred and are measured at their fair value. For such recognition to occur, management, with the appropriate level of authority, must have approved and committed to a firm plan\nand appropriate communication to those affected must have occurred. These provisions may require an estimation of costs such as severance and termination benefits, pension and related curtailments, environmental remediation and may also include expenses related to demolition and outplacement. Actions taken may also require an evaluation of any remaining assets to determine required impairments, if any, and a review of estimated remaining useful lives which may lead to accelerated depreciation expense.\nEstimates of cash flows and fair value relating to closures and restructuring require judgment. Closure and restructuring liabilities are based on management's best estimates of future events. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may differ from these estimates due to subsequent business developments. As such, additional costs and further impairment charges may be required in future periods.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $136 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $34 million of severance and termination costs, $31 million of inventory obsolescence and $34 million of other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $32 million of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of long-lived assets and $1 million of accelerated depreciation under Depreciation and amortization, on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, we recorded $3 million of severance and termination costs, $4 million of inventory obsolescence and $2 million of other costs, under Closure and restructuring costs in relation to the paper machine closures. Concurrently, with the Ashdown paper machine closure and related workforce reduction, management negotiated a voluntary early retirement program to reduce costs and put the mill in a stronger cost position in the long-term. We additionally recorded $13 million of severance and termination costs under Closure and restructuring costs.\nAdditional information can be found under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of license rights ($6 million) and water rights ($4 million). We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the asset level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are evaluated at the beginning of the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. In connection with the Company's annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment for each indefinite-lived intangible asset (license rights and water rights). The qualitative assessments performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated that the indefinite-lived intangible assets had fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts.\nPension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWe have several defined contribution plans and multiemployer plans. The pension expense under these plans is equal to our contribution. Defined contribution pension expense was $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $39 million).\nWe sponsor both contributory and non-contributory U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor a number of other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees; the plans are unfunded and include life insurance programs and medical and dental benefits. In addition, we provide supplemental unfunded defined benefit pension plans and supplemental unfunded defined contribution pension plans to certain senior management employees.\nWe account for pensions and other post-retirement benefits in accordance with Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board-Accounting Standards Committee which requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and other post-retirement benefit charges require assumptions in order to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations. These assumptions require considerable management judgment and include:\n - Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets - used to estimate the growth and expected return on assets \n - Discount rate - used to determine interest costs and the net present value of our obligations \n - Rate of compensation increase - used to calculate the impact of future increases on our obligations \n - Health care cost trends - used to calculate the impact of future health care costs on our obligations \n - Employee related factors, such as mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and disabilities - used to determine the extent of our obligations \nChanges in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are amortized over the expected average remaining service life of the active employee group covered by the plans, only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess\nof 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market value of assets, over the average remaining service period of approximately ten years of the active employee group covered by the pension plans, and 12 years of the active employee group covered by the other post-retirement benefits plans.\nAn expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.6% was considered appropriate by management for the determination of pension expense for 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, we will use 4.4% as the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the current view of long-term investment returns. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on management's best estimate of the long-term returns of the major asset classes (cash and cash equivalents, equities and bonds) weighted by the target allocation of assets at the measurement date, net of expenses. This rate includes an equity risk premium over government bond returns for equity investments and a value-added premium for the contribution to returns from active management. The sources used to determine management's best estimate of long-term returns are numerous and include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country-specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts' or governments' expectations, as applicable.\nWe set our discount rate assumption annually to reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed income debt instruments, with a duration that is expected to match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. High-quality debt instruments are corporate bonds with a rating of AA or better. The discount rates at December 31, 2020 for pension plans were estimated at 2.5% for the projected benefit obligation and 3.0% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2020 and for post-retirement benefit plans were estimated at 2.5% for the projected benefit obligation and 3.0% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2020.\nWe used a full yield curve approach to estimate the current service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for Canadian pension plans and U.S. funded pension plans. The estimate of these components is made by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We used this approach to provide a more precise measurement of current service and interest cost components by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.\nThe rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption in the actuarial model for pension (set at 2.7% for the projected benefit obligation and 2.8% for the net periodic benefit cost) and for post-retirement benefit plans (set at 2.8% for the projected benefit obligation and 2.7% for the net periodic benefit cost) and is determined based upon our long-term plans for such increases.\nFor employee related factors, mortality rate tables tailored to our industry were used and the other factors reflect our historical experience and management's best estimate regarding future expectations.\nFor measurement purposes, a 3.9% weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2020.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the key weighted average economic assumptions used in measuring the projected pension benefit obligation, the accrued other post-retirement benefit obligation and related net periodic benefit cost for 2020. The sensitivity analysis should be used with caution as it is hypothetical and changes in each key assumption may not be linear. The sensitivities in each key variable have been calculated independently of each other.\n\nOur pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually the amount required to provide for benefits earned in the year and to fund solvency deficiencies, funding shortfalls and past service obligations over periods not exceeding those permitted by the applicable regulatory authorities. Past service obligations primarily arise from improvements to plan benefits. The other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded and contributions are made annually to cover benefit payments.\nWe expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $13 million in 2021 compared to $15 million in 2020 (2019 - $17 million) to the pension plans. We expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $4 million in 2021 compared to $4 million in 2020 to the other post-retirement benefit plans (2019 - $4 million).\nBenefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 for our pension and post-retirement plans were are follows:\n\nFor additional details on our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, refer to Note 7 Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\u201d.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined according to differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. The change in the net deferred tax asset or liability is included in earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the years in which assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these years, a projection of taxable income and an assumption of the ultimate recovery or settlement period for temporary differences are required. The projection of future taxable income is based on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\nWe assess the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and, if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on these taxable income projections, a valuation allowance is recorded. In general, realization\u201d refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or an increase in future taxes refundable from the deferred tax assets. Evaluating the need for an amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment. All available evidence, both positive and negative, should be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. In our evaluation process, we give the most weight to historical income or losses. After evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, although realization is not assured, we determined that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, with the exception of certain state credits and losses for which a valuation allowance of $13 million exists at December 31, 2020, the tax basis difference in our assets held of sale (U.S. and foreign) for which a valuation allowance of $44 million exists at December 31, 2020, and certain foreign loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance of $7 million exists at December 31, 2020. Of this amount, $47 million unfavorably impacted tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2020 (2019 -$5 million).\nOur deferred tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to various accruals, accounting provisions, pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, and available tax credits. Our deferred tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences pertaining to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, leases and other items. Estimating the ultimate settlement period requires judgment. The reversal of timing differences is expected at enacted tax rates, which could change due to changes in income tax laws or the introduction of tax changes through the presentation of annual budgets by different governments. As a result, a change in the timing and the income tax rate at which the components will reverse could materially affect deferred tax expense in our future results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities. To the best of our knowledge, we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law. In accordance with Income Taxes Topic of FASB ASC 740, we evaluate new tax positions that result in a tax benefit to us and determine the amount of tax benefits that can be recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if changes in recognition or classification are necessary. Significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected within the next 12 months are disclosed quarterly. Future\nrecognition of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate in the period the benefits are recognized. At December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $23 million (2019 - $28 million). These amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were sustained, such as federal deduction that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained. As of December 31, 2020, we believe it is reasonably possible that up to $4 million of our unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized in 2021, which could impact the effective tax rate. However, the amount and timing of the recognition of these benefits is subject to some uncertainty. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporation multinationals, such as the U.S. Tax Reform, enacted in 2017. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Reform that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially impact our financial results.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities.\nTax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law, and we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further details refer to Note 10 Income Taxes\u201d.\nContingencies related to legal claims\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, under the risk Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results or condition\u201d and in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount is reasonably estimable. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of the then available facts with respect to each matter. When no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. For further details on Contingencies\u201d and legal claims refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.", "item_7_tables": "Table 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve months

paper and pulp manufacturing company. It is selling its Personal Care business and will operate as a single segment going forward. \n\n- COVID-19 negatively impacted demand for Domtar's paper products in 2020. Paper shipments were down 19% while pulp shipments were up 7%. The company implemented cost reductions, including closing several facilities.\n\n- Sales decreased 16% in 2020 vs 2019 due to lower prices and paper volumes, partially offset by higher pulp volumes. Operating loss was $177M in 2020 compared to income of $179M in 2019.\n\n- The company reported a net loss of $127M in 2020 compared to net earnings of $88M in 2019. The loss was driven by lower sales, restructuring charges, accelerated depreciation, and lower operating income.\n\n- Domtar took several actions to preserve cash flow and liquidity during COVID-19, including suspending dividends/buybacks, reducing capital expenditures, and securing new financing. \n\n- The company expects continued uncertainty in paper markets in 2021 but some improvement in pulp. Input costs are expected to increase moderately.\n\n- Domtar announced a $200M cost reduction program in 2020 to improve efficiency, margins and cash flow. This involved capacity reductions, asset closures, and rightsizing.\n\n- The company has a defined benefit pension plan and provides other post-retirement benefits. It made contributions of $15M to the pension plan and $4M to other benefits in 2020.\n\nIn summary, COVID-19 and structural declines in paper demand challenged Domtar in 2020. The company is undertaking significant restructuring while positioning for growth in pulp and packaging."}
