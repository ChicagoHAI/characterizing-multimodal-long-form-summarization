Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our fiscal year ends January 31. References to fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 refer to the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nBasis of Presentation\nThis management's discussion and analysis discusses our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021. Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021 for a comparison of the year ended January 31, 2021 to the year ended January 31, 2020.\nFinancial Highlights\nFiscal 2022\n\u2022Total revenue increased 43% to $213.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared with $148.7 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Net loss was $118.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared with $27.3 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA was negative $59.0 million in fiscal 2022, compared with positive $3.8 million in fiscal\n2021.\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million in fiscal 2022, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Free cash flow was negative $105.5 million in fiscal 2022 compared with negative $15.7 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Cash and cash equivalents was $313.8 million as of January 31, 2022, compared with $218.8 million as of January 31, 2021.\nFor a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss and free cash flow to cash (used in) provided by operating activities, and for more information as to how we define and calculate such measures, see the section below titled Non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of comprehensive software solutions that improve the operational and financial performance of healthcare organizations by activating patients in their care to optimize patient health outcomes. As evidenced in industry survey reports from KLAS, we have been recognized as a leader based on our integration capabilities with healthcare services client organizations, the broad adoption of our patient intake functionalities, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by overall client satisfaction. Through our SaaS-based technology platform, which we refer to as the Phreesia Platform or our Platform, we offer healthcare services clients a robust suite of integrated solutions that manage patient access, registration, payments and clinical support. Our Platform also provides life sciences companies, patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations with a channel for targeted and direct communication with patients.\nWe serve an array of healthcare services clients of all sizes across over 25 specialties, ranging from single-specialty practices, including internal and family medicine, urology, dermatology, and orthopedics, to large, multi-specialty\ngroups, health systems as well as regional and national payers and other organizations that provide other types of healthcare-related services. Our life sciences revenue is generated from clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries as well as patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations seeking to activate, engage and educate patients about topics critical to their health.\nWe derive revenue from (i) subscription fees from healthcare services clients for access to the Phreesia Platform and related professional services fees, (ii) payment processing fees based on levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform and (iii) fees from life sciences companies to deliver marketing content to patients using the Phreesia Platform. We have strong visibility into our business as the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring subscription fees and re-occurring payment processing fees.\nWe market and sell our products and services to healthcare services clients throughout the United States using a direct sales organization. Our demand generation team develops content and identifies prospects that our sales development team researches and qualifies to generate high-grade, actionable sales leads. Our direct sales force executes on these qualified sales leads, partnering with client services to ensure prospects are educated on the breadth of our capabilities and demonstrable value proposition, with the goal of attracting and retaining clients and expanding their use of our Platform over time. Most of our Platform solutions are contracted pursuant to annual, auto-renewing agreements. Our sales typically involve competitive processes and sales cycles have, on average, varied in duration from three months to six months, depending on the size of the potential client. In addition, through Phreesia University (Phreesia's in-house training program), events, client conferences and webinars, we help our healthcare services clients optimize their businesses and, as a result, support client retention.\nWe also sell products and services to pharmaceutical brands and advertising agencies through our direct sales and\nmarketing teams.\nSince our inception, we have not marketed our products internationally. Accordingly, substantially all of our revenue from historical periods has come from the United States, and our current strategy is to continue to focus substantially all of our sales efforts within the United States.\nOur revenue growth has been primarily organic and reflects our significant addition of new healthcare services clients and increased revenue from existing clients. New healthcare services clients are defined as clients that go live in the applicable period and existing healthcare services clients are defined as clients that go live in any period before the applicable period.\nInvestments in Growth\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, we accelerated hiring and overall investments across all areas of Phreesia to prepare for our anticipated growth in clients and use of our platform. In fiscal 2023 and thereafter, we expect growth in our team and compensation to moderate.\nRecent developments\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic. There continues to be uncertainty as to the duration and extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, and results of operations, as well as macroeconomic conditions, at this time.\nAcquisitions\nOn December 3, 2021, we acquired Insignia Health, LLC (\"Insignia\"), for cash consideration of $37.2 million. Insignia provides coaching and education solutions based on Insignia's exclusive worldwide license to the Patient Activation Measure (\"PAM\"\u00ae). We acquired Insignia to enable us to understand and engage patients in more personalized ways based on their level of activation.\nOn January 8, 2021, we acquired QueueDr Inc (\"QueueDr\"), a SaaS technology company. Over time, we believe the underlying QueueDr technology will enhance our appointments solutions and the overall value of the Phreesia\nplatform to healthcare services clients. The total consideration for the acquisition consists of $5.8 million in cash, $2.1 million of liabilities incurred and $2.2 million in performance-related contingent payments.\nSee Note 16 - Acquisitions in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Insignia and QueueDr.\nSilicon Valley Bank Facility\nOn March 28, 2022, we entered into the First Loan Modification Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Second SVB Facility\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) (as amended, the \"Third SVB Facility\") to increase the borrowing capacity from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. The Third SVB Facility also reduced the interest rate to the greater of 3.25% or the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 0.5%, amended the annual commitment fees to approximately $0.3 million per year and amended the quarterly fee to 0.15% per annum of the average unused revolving line under the facility.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review the following key metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, make strategic business decisions and assess working capital needs. Table 7: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key Metrics: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare services clients (average over period) </td> <td>2,074 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363 </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average revenue per healthcare services client </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,478 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,979 </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhreesia remains focused on building secure and reliable products that derive a strong return on investment for our clients and implementing them with speed and ease. This strategy continues to enable us to grow our network of healthcare services clients. With the expansion of our operations in the payer market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we have renamed our key metric \"provider clients (average over period)\" to \"healthcare services clients (average over period)\". We have also renamed our key metric \"average revenue per provider client\" to \"average revenue per healthcare services client.\" While we believe the contribution of payers (including payer clients added in connection with the acquisition of Insignia) has not yet been material to our business, we intend to grow our footprint with payers and organizations who provide other types of healthcare-related services, and we believe it is an appropriate time to broaden the definition of these key metrics.\n\u2022Healthcare services clients. We define healthcare services clients as the average number of healthcare services client organizations that generate revenue each month during the applicable period. In cases where we act as a subcontractor providing white-label services to our partner's clients, we treat the contractual relationship as a single healthcare services client. We believe growth in the number of healthcare services clients is a key indicator of the performance of our business and depends, in part, on our ability to successfully develop and market our Platform to healthcare services organizations that are not yet clients. While growth in the number of healthcare services clients is an important indicator of expected revenue growth, it also informs our management of the areas of our business that will require further investment to support expected future healthcare services client growth. For example, as the number of healthcare services clients increases, we may need to add to our customer support team and invest to maintain effectiveness and performance of our Platform and software for our healthcare services clients and their patients.\n\u2022Average revenue per healthcare services client. We define average revenue per healthcare services client as the total subscription and related services and payment processing revenue generated from healthcare services clients in a given period divided by the average number of healthcare services clients that generate revenue each month during that same period. We are focused on continually delivering value to our healthcare services clients and believe that our ability to increase average revenue per healthcare services client is an indicator of the long-term value of the Phreesia platform.\nAdditional Information\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Patient payment volume (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,769 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>772 </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment facilitator volume percentage </td> <td>79 </td> <td>% </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Patient payment volume. We believe that patient payment volume is an indicator of both the underlying health of our healthcare services clients' businesses and the continuing shift of healthcare costs to patients. We measure patient payment volume as the total dollar volume of transactions between our healthcare services clients and their patients utilizing our payment platform, including via credit and debit cards that we process as a payment facilitator as well as cash and check payments and credit and debit transactions for which Phreesia acts as a gateway to other payment processors.\n\u2022Payment facilitator volume percentage. We define payment facilitator volume percentage as the volume of credit and debit card patient payment volume that we process as a payment facilitator as a percentage of total patient payment volume. Payment facilitator volume is a major driver of our payment processing revenue. We anticipate that our payment facilitator volume percentage will decline slightly over time as we increase our penetration of larger health systems that are less likely to use Phreesia as a payment facilitator.\nResults of operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods:\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and related services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,514 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing fees </td> <td>65,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>49,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life sciences </td> <td>52,518 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>213,233 </td> <td> </td> <td>148,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>42,669 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing expense </td> <td>38,719 </td> <td> </td> <td>28,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>106,421 </td> <td> </td> <td>42,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>52,265 </td> <td> </td> <td>22,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>68,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>40,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation </td> <td>14,985 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization </td> <td>6,317 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses </td> <td>330,050 </td> <td> </td> <td>174,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td>% </td> <td>117 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss </td> <td>(116,817) </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,671) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net </td> <td>(78) </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (expense) income, net </td> <td>(1,084) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,573) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (expense) income, net </td> <td>(1,162) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,572) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before provision for income taxes </td> <td>(117,979) </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,243) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>(182) </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,161) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of statements of operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from providing an integrated SaaS-based software and payment platform for the healthcare industry. We derive revenue from subscription fees and related services generated from our healthcare services clients for access to the Phreesia Platform, payment processing fees based on the levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform, and from digital marketing revenue from life sciences companies to reach, educate and communicate with patients when they are most receptive and actively seeking care.\nOur total revenue consists of the following:\n\u2022Subscription and related services. We primarily generate subscription fees from our healthcare services clients based on the number of healthcare services clients that subscribe to and utilize the Phreesia Platform. Our healthcare services clients are typically billed monthly in arrears, though in some instances, healthcare services clients may opt to be billed quarterly or annually in advance. Subscription fees are typically auto-debited from healthcare services clients' accounts every month. As we target and add larger enterprise healthcare services clients, these clients may choose to contract differently than our typical per healthcare services client subscription model. To the extent we charge in an alternative manner with larger enterprise healthcare services clients, we expect that such a pricing model will recur and, combined with our per healthcare services client subscription fees, will increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nIn addition, we receive certain fees from healthcare services clients for professional services associated with our implementation services as well as travel and expense reimbursements, shipping and handling fees, sales of hardware (PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks), on-site support and training.\n\u2022Payment processing fees. We generate revenue from payment processing fees based on the number of transactions and the levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform. Payment processing fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the total transaction dollar value processed and/or a fee per transaction. Credit and debit patient payment volume processed through our payment facilitator model represented 79% and 81% of our patient payment volume in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remainder of our patient payment volume is composed of credit and debit transactions for which Phreesia acts as a gateway to another payment processor, and cash and check transactions. Utilization trends have been dynamic through the pandemic, diverging from our pre-pandemic seasonality. We expect the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal year 2023.\n\u2022Life sciences. We generate revenue from the sale of digital marketing solutions to life sciences companies. As we expand our healthcare services client base, we increase the number of new patients we can reach to deliver targeted marketing content on behalf of our life sciences clients.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses for implementation and technical support, and infrastructure costs to operate our Platform such as hosting fees and fees paid to various third-party providers for access to their technology, as well as costs to verify insurance eligibility and benefits.\nPayment processing expense\nPayment processing expense consists primarily of interchange fees set by payment card networks and that are ultimately paid to the card-issuing financial institution, assessment fees paid to payment card networks, and fees paid to third-party payment processors and gateways. Payment processing expense may increase as a percentage of payment processing revenue if card networks raise pricing for interchange and assessment fees or if we reduce pricing to our clients.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, commissions, bonuses and benefits costs for our sales and marketing personnel. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for advertising, promotional and other marketing activities, as well as certain fees paid to various third-party partners for sales and lead generation. Advertising is expensed as incurred.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense consists of costs to develop our products and services that do not meet the criteria for capitalization as internal-use software. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses for our development personnel. Research and development expense also includes third-party partner fees and third-party consulting fees, offset by any internal-use software development cost capitalized during the same period.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our executive, finance, legal, security, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also includes software costs to support our finance, legal and human resources operations, insurance costs as well as fees to third-party providers for accounting, legal and consulting services, costs for various non income-based taxes and allocated overhead. We expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and continue to operate as a public company, although we expect such expense to begin to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation represents depreciation expense for PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks, data center and other computer hardware, purchased computer software, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization\nAmortization primarily represents amortization of our capitalized internal-use software related to the Phreesia Platform as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOur other expense and income line items consist of the following:\n\u2022Other (expense) income, net. Other (expense) income, net consists of foreign currency-related losses and gains and other miscellaneous (expense) income.\n\u2022Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest income has not been material to our operations to date.\n\u2022Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on our financing obligations as well as amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs.\nProvision for income taxes\nBased upon our cumulative pre-tax losses in recent years and available evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2022 will not be realized in the near term. Consequently, we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets totaling approximately $97.3 million and $54.6 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. In future periods, if we conclude we have future taxable income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance.\nComparison of fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021\nRevenue (in thousands) Table 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and related services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,514 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,472 </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing fees </td> <td>65,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>49,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,301 </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life sciences </td> <td>52,518 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,783 </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,233 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,556 </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Subscription and related services. Our subscription and related services revenue from health services organizations increased $26.5 million to $95.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $69.0 million for fiscal 2021, primarily due to new health services clients added in fiscal 2022 as well as expansion of and cross-selling to existing health services clients.\n\u2022Payment processing fees. Our revenue from patient payments processed through the Phreesia Platform increased $15.3 million to $65.2 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $49.9 million for fiscal 2021, due to the addition of more healthcare services clients, expansion of existing healthcare services clients, as well as the reduced impact of COVID-19, which had decreased patient visits in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Life sciences. Our revenue from life science clients for digital marketing increased $22.8 million to $52.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $29.7 million for fiscal 2021 due to an increase in new digital marketing solutions programs and deeper patient outreach among the existing programs.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) Table 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,669 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,208 </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased $19.2 million to $42.7 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $23.5 million for fiscal 2021.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and\namortization, and before stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and other expense (income), net.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\n\u2022Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) the potentially dilutive impact of non-cash stock-based compensation; (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; or (4) interest expense (income), net; and\n\u2022Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,161) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,292) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (income), net </td> <td>1,084 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,573 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>182 </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>21,302 </td> <td> </td> <td>15,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>36,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,489 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59,023) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,797 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe calculate free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capitalized internal-use software development costs and purchases of property and equipment.\nAdditionally, free cash flow is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic investments, partnerships and acquisitions and strengthening our financial position.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow from net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74,710) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,890 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized internal-use software </td> <td>(12,385) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,334) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment </td> <td>(18,420) </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,241) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105,515) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,685) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOn October 23, 2020, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, in which we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at an issuance price of $32.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $174,800, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and before deducting third-party offering costs of $290.\nOn April 12, 2021, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In connection with this offering, we issued and sold 5,175,000 shares of common stock at an issuance price of $50.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $245,813, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $313.8 million and $218.8 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market accounts and cash on deposit.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our available financial resources from our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk factors.\u201d\nIn the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSilicon Valley Bank facility\nSecond Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn May 5, 2020, we entered into the Second SVB Facility. The Second SVB Facility provided for a revolving line of credit of up to $50.0 million (with options to increase up to $65.0 million). We transferred the $20.0 million outstanding balance on a previous SVB Facility, the First SVB Facility term loan, plus related prepayment fees, into the revolving credit borrowings outstanding under the Second SVB Facility. As of January 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Second SVB Facility was 4.5%. Borrowings under the Second SVB Facility were payable on May 5, 2025. We repaid the outstanding balance on the Second SVB Facility in January 2021. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no outstanding balance on the Second SVB Facility and $50.0 million of available borrowings under the facility. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Second SVB Facility as of January 31, 2022.\nThird SVB Facility\nOn March 28, 2022, we entered into the Third SVB Facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. The Third SVB Facility also reduced the interest rate to the greater of 3.25% or the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 0.5%, amended the annual commitment fees to approximately $0.3 million per year and amended the quarterly fee to 0.15% per annum of the average unused revolving line under the facility.\nIn the event that we terminate the Third SVB Facility prior to the Maturity Date and do not replace the facility with another SVB facility, we are required to pay a termination fee equal to $0.2 million plus a percent of total borrowing capacity, both of which would be reduced based on the amount of time elapsed before the termination.\nAny of our obligations under the Third SVB Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than intellectual property. The Third SVB Facility includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Adjusted Quick Ratio, as defined in the Third SVB Facility.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74,710) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,890 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(65,228) </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,085) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>234,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>150,661 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,031 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nThe primary source of cash from operating activities is cash received from our customers. The primary uses of cash\nfor operating activities are for payroll, payments to suppliers and employees, payments for operating leases, as well as cash paid for interest on our finance leases and other borrowings and cash paid for various sales, property and income taxes.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million, as our cash paid to employees and suppliers exceeded our cash received from customers.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million, as our cash received from customers exceeded our cash paid to employees and suppliers in connection with our normal operations.\nThe change in cash used in operating activities was driven primarily by higher employee compensation costs, primarily due to higher employee headcount as well as an increase in compensation costs for existing employees, partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers driven by higher revenues.\nInvesting activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $65.2 million, principally resulting from $34.4 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of Insignia, $18.4 million of purchases of property and equipment, principally driven by the purchase of data center equipment, as well as $12.4 million of cash paid for capitalized internal-use software.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $25.1 million, principally resulting from capital expenditures, the bulk of which consists of hardware used by clients and the purchase of data center equipment of $11.2 million, capitalized internal-use software costs of $7.3 million and $6.5 million used for the acquisition of QueueDr, net of cash acquired.\nFinancing activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $235.0 million, primarily consisting of $245.8 million in proceeds from the April 2021 offering of our common stock, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and $6.9 million in proceeds from our equity compensation plans, partially offset by $9.0 million used for treasury stock to satisfy tax withholdings on stock compensation awards, $5.3 million used for principal payments on finance leases and financing arrangements and $3.3 million used for payments of acquisition-related liabilities.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $150.7 million, consisting of $174.8 million in proceeds from the October 2020 offering of our common stock, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options as well as $2.0 million in proceeds from an insurance financing arrangement, partially offset by $20.7 million used to repay the outstanding principal balance of the Second SVB Facility, $5.0 million used for treasury stock to satisfy tax withholdings on stock compensation awards, $4.3 million used for principal payments on finance leases and financing arrangements, $0.4 million used for debt and equity issuance and offering costs and $0.2 million for loan facility fee payments. The lender fees incurred in connection with the Second SVB Facility were transferred into the principal balance of the Second SVB Facility. We have included the transfer of the balance of the First SVB\nFacility and the fees that were transferred in connection with the Second SVB Facility within the supplemental non-cash investing and financing information on our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements relate to leases, financing arrangements and contractual purchase commitments and human capital. Refer to Note 4 - Composition of certain financial statement accounts in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on accrued payroll related liabilities. Refer to Note 6 - Finance leases and other debt, Note 10 - Leases and Note 11 - Commitments and contingencies in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on cash requirements for leases, financing arrangements and contractual purchase commitments.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our most significant estimates and judgments involve revenue recognition, the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations, capitalized internal-use software, income taxes, and valuation of our stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue recognition\nWe account for revenue from contracts with clients by applying the requirements of Topic 606, which includes the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a client.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in a contract.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe believe the areas in which we apply the most critical judgements when determining revenue recognition relate to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the assessment of the standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) for each performance obligation identified, the determination of the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price of our contracts with customers and the determination of whether we are the principal or the agent for certain performance obligations.\nDetermination of Performance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Our contracts with customers may include multiple promises to transfer services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and the value delivered to the customer.\nOur subscription and related services revenue includes certain fees from clients for professional services associated with implementation services.\nIn determining whether professional services for implementation are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services and the complexity of interfaces created between systems.\nWe determined that the majority of implementation services were not distinct from the related subscription service because they are proprietary such that they cannot be performed by another entity, because we generally do not sell professional services on a stand-alone basis, and because they are integral to the customer's ability to derive the intended benefit of the subscription service, indicating that the implementation services and related subscription are inputs to a combined output.\nDetermination of Standalone Selling Prices\nWe allocate the transaction price of our customer contracts to the performance obligations within those contracts based on the relative SSP of the performance obligations.\nThe SSP is the price that we would sell a product separately to a customer. The best evidence of this is an observable price from stand-alone sales of that product to similarly situated customers. However, as we do not typically transfer our performance obligations on a standalone basis, but rather we transfer bundles of performance obligations, we use an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate the price a customer would be willing to pay for our performance obligations using historical price information as priced in previous bundled contracts, our cost structure and our expectations for profit margins.\nIn determining SSPs, we stratify the population of customer transactions by product, type, size of customer and geographic area. We typically establish a range of SSPs for each of our performance obligations.\nThe prices we charge for digital messaging solutions provided to life sciences companies have historically been highly variable. We consider pricing to be highly variable if we have a history of selling the services at a wide range of prices to similar customers in similar geographic areas within the same time periods. As the pricing of our digital messaging solutions has historically been highly variable, we use the residual method to estimate the SSP of performance obligations for digital messaging solutions. We estimate the residual SSP of our digital messaging solutions as the total transaction price of the customer contract less the SSPs of the remaining performance obligations pursuant to the contract.\nVariable Consideration\nWe estimate the transaction price at contract inception, including any variable consideration, and we update the estimate each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. When determining the transaction price, we assume the products will be transferred to the customer based on the terms of the existing contract and our assumption does not take into consideration the possibility of a contract being canceled, renewed, or modified.\nWe occasionally provide credits to customers representing adjustments to the transaction price. Known and estimable credits and adjustments represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and generally result in reductions to revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We estimate the amount of variable consideration based on its expected probability-weighted value or its most likely amount. We include variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue when the uncertainty with respect to the variable consideration is resolved. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of January 31, 2022.\nPrincipal vs Agent Considerations\nAs part of our revenue recognition process, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent for the performance obligations in our contracts with customers. When we determine that we are the principal for a performance obligation, we recognize revenue for that performance obligation on a gross basis. When we determine that we are an agent for a performance obligation, we recognize revenue for that performance obligation net of the related costs. In determining whether we are the principal or the agent, we evaluate whether we have control of the services before we transfer the services to the customer by considering whether we are primarily obligated for transferring the services to the customer, whether we have inventory risk for the services before the services are transferred to the customer, and whether we have latitude in establishing prices. We recognize payment processing fees collected from customers as revenue on a gross basis because, as the merchant of record, we control the services before delivery to the customer, we are primarily responsible for the delivery of the services to our customers, we have latitude in establishing pricing with respect to the customer and other terms of service, we have\nsole discretion in selecting the third party to perform the settlement, and we assume the credit risk for the transaction processed. We also have the unilateral ability to accept or reject a transaction based on our established criteria.\nBusiness combinations\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. With the assistance of third-party appraisers, we assess the fair value of the assets acquired in business combinations. The fair value of the acquired licenses and technology was estimated using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of customer relationships was estimated using a multi period excess earnings method. To calculate fair value, we used cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each client grouping. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nWhere applicable, the consideration transferred for business combinations includes the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration. In connection with the QueueDr acquisition, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities within accrued expenses for amounts payable to the selling shareholders based on collections from QueueDr customers. The fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation which uses estimated cash flows and likelihoods of contract cancellation to estimate the expected payout based on collections and active status of the underlying customer contracts. The fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was determined based on inputs which are not readily available in public markets. Therefore, we categorized the liabilities as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In connection with the acquisition of QueueDr, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities with an acquisition-date fair value of $2,240. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2022, we paid a total of $2,574 to settle the contingent consideration liabilities, which represented the maximum amount payable for the contingent consideration liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCapitalized internal-use software\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred for the development of computer software for internal use pursuant to ASC Topic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal use software. These costs relate to the development of our Phreesia Platform. We capitalize the costs during the development of the project, when it is determined that it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities, post-implementation activities, training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our solutions, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nIncome taxes\nAn asset and liability approach is used for financial accounting and reporting of current and deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income or loss. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We follow ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in the interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nWe have accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $332.5 million, and $199.1 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of January 31, 2022, our foreign branch had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.9 million, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and will expire beginning in 2030.\nIn assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset we consider all relevant positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors, including the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.\nDue to uncertainty regarding the ability to realize the benefit of U.S. deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards, we have established valuation allowances to reduce deferred the U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. On the basis of this evaluation, we have recorded valuation allowances of $97.3 million and $54.6 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. As of January 31, 2022, we have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $332.5 million. We have completed a Section 382 study and, as a result of the analysis, it is more likely than not that we have experienced an \"ownership change\". We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. Accordingly, if we earn net taxable income, it is more likely than not that our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability.\nWe review and evaluate tax positions in major jurisdictions and determine whether we record unrecognized tax benefits as reductions of deferred tax assets or as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these unrecognized tax benefits when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There was no outstanding balance for unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2022.\nStock-based compensation for market-based performance stock units (\"PSUs\")\nWe recognize the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards issued as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. We granted market-based PSUs during fiscal 2022.\nEach award vests in zero to two shares of common stock based on our total stockholder return (TSR), relative to a peer group of companies on the Russell 3000 stock index. We estimate the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo Simulation model which projects TSR for Phreesia and each member of the peer group over a performance period of approximately three years. The most critical and judgmental assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the fair value of the PSUs are set forth below:\n\u2022Correlation coefficient: The correlation coefficient measures the correlation of our stock to the stock of the companies in the peer group. This coefficient is used to project the performance of our stock against our peers to estimate projected performance under the plan.\n\u2022Expected volatility: The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of peer companies within our industry which were commensurate with the simulation term assumption.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 3 to our Consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

As evidenced in industry survey reports from KLAS, we have been recognized as a leader based on our integration capabilities with healthcare services client organizations, the broad adoption of our patient intake functionalities, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by overall client satisfaction. Through our SaaS-based technology platform, which we refer to as the Phreesia Platform or our Platform, we offer healthcare services clients a robust suite of integrated solutions that manage patient access, registration, payments and clinical support. Our Platform also provides life sciences companies, patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations with a channel for targeted and direct communication with patients.\nWe serve an array of healthcare services clients of all sizes across over 25 specialties, ranging from single-specialty practices, including internal and family medicine, urology, dermatology, and orthopedics, to large, multi-specialty\ngroups, health systems as well as regional and national payers and other organizations that provide other types of healthcare-related services. Our life sciences revenue is generated from clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries as well as patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations seeking to activate, engage and educate patients about topics critical to their health.\nWe derive revenue from (i) subscription fees from healthcare services clients for access to the Phreesia Platform and related professional services fees, (ii) payment processing fees based on levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform and (iii) fees from life sciences companies to deliver marketing content to patients using the Phreesia Platform. We have strong visibility into our business as the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring subscription fees and re-occurring payment processing fees.\nWe market and sell our products and services to healthcare services clients throughout the United States using a direct sales organization. Our demand generation team develops content and identifies prospects that our sales development team researches and qualifies to generate high-grade, actionable sales leads. Our direct sales force executes on these qualified sales leads, partnering with client services to ensure prospects are educated on the breadth of our capabilities and demonstrable value proposition, with the goal of attracting and retaining clients and expanding their use of our Platform over time. Most of our Platform solutions are contracted pursuant to annual, auto-renewing agreements. Our sales typically involve competitive processes and sales cycles have, on average, varied in duration from three months to six months, depending on the size of the potential client. In addition, through Phreesia University (Phreesia's in-house training program), events, client conferences and webinars, we help our healthcare services clients optimize their businesses and, as a result, support client retention.\nWe also sell products and services to pharmaceutical brands and advertising agencies through our direct sales and\nmarketing teams.\nSince our inception, we have not marketed our products internationally. Accordingly, substantially all of our revenue from historical periods has come from the United States, and our current strategy is to continue to focus substantially all of our sales efforts within the United States.\nOur revenue growth has been primarily organic and reflects our significant addition of new healthcare services clients and increased revenue from existing clients. New healthcare services clients are defined as clients that go live in the applicable period and existing healthcare services clients are defined as clients that go live in any period before the applicable period.\nInvestments in Growth\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, we accelerated hiring and overall investments across all areas of Phreesia to prepare for our anticipated growth in clients and use of our platform. In fiscal 2023 and thereafter, we expect growth in our team and compensation to moderate.\nRecent developments\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic. There continues to be uncertainty as to the duration and extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, and results of operations, as well as macroeconomic conditions, at this time.\nAcquisitions\nOn December 3, 2021, we acquired Insignia Health, LLC (\"Insignia\"), for cash consideration of $37.2 million. Insignia provides coaching and education solutions based on Insignia's exclusive worldwide license to the Patient Activation Measure (\"PAM\"\u00ae). We acquired Insignia to enable us to understand and engage patients in more personalized ways based on their level of activation.\nOn January 8, 2021, we acquired QueueDr Inc (\"QueueDr\"), a SaaS technology company. Over time, we believe the underlying QueueDr technology will enhance our appointments solutions and the overall value of the Phreesia\nplatform to healthcare services clients. The total consideration for the acquisition consists of $5.8 million in cash, $2.1 million of liabilities incurred and $2.2 million in performance-related contingent payments.\nSee Note 16 - Acquisitions in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Insignia and QueueDr.\nSilicon Valley Bank Facility\nOn March 28, 2022, we entered into the First Loan Modification Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Second SVB Facility\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) (as amended, the \"Third SVB Facility\") to increase the borrowing capacity from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. The Third SVB Facility also reduced the interest rate to the greater of 3.25% or the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 0.5%, amended the annual commitment fees to approximately $0.3 million per year and amended the quarterly fee to 0.15% per annum of the average unused revolving line under the facility.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review the following key metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, make strategic business decisions and assess working capital needs. Table 7: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key Metrics: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare services clients (average over period) </td> <td>2,074 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363 </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average revenue per healthcare services client </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,478 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,979 </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhreesia remains focused on building secure and reliable products that derive a strong return on investment for our clients and implementing them with speed and ease. This strategy continues to enable us to grow our network of healthcare services clients. With the expansion of our operations in the payer market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we have renamed our key metric \"provider clients (average over period)\" to \"healthcare services clients (average over period)\". We have also renamed our key metric \"average revenue per provider client\" to \"average revenue per healthcare services client.\" While we believe the contribution of payers (including payer clients added in connection with the acquisition of Insignia) has not yet been material to our business, we intend to grow our footprint with payers and organizations who provide other types of healthcare-related services, and we believe it is an appropriate time to broaden the definition of these key metrics.\n\u2022Healthcare services clients. We define healthcare services clients as the average number of healthcare services client organizations that generate revenue each month during the applicable period. In cases where we act as a subcontractor providing white-label services to our partner's clients, we treat the contractual relationship as a single healthcare services client. We believe growth in the number of healthcare services clients is a key indicator of the performance of our business and depends, in part, on our ability to successfully develop and market our Platform to healthcare services organizations that are not yet clients. While growth in the number of healthcare services clients is an important indicator of expected revenue growth, it also informs our management of the areas of our business that will require further investment to support expected future healthcare services client growth. For example, as the number of healthcare services clients increases, we may need to add to our customer support team and invest to maintain effectiveness and performance of our Platform and software for our healthcare services clients and their patients.\n\u2022Average revenue per healthcare services client. We define average revenue per healthcare services client as the total subscription and related services and payment processing revenue generated from healthcare services clients in a given period divided by the average number of healthcare services clients that generate revenue each month during that same period. We are focused on continually delivering value to our healthcare services clients and believe that our ability to increase average revenue per healthcare services client is an indicator of the long-term value of the Phreesia platform.\nAdditional Information\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Patient payment volume (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,769 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>772 </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment facilitator volume percentage </td> <td>79 </td> <td>% </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Patient payment volume. We believe that patient payment volume is an indicator of both the underlying health of our healthcare services clients' businesses and the continuing shift of healthcare costs to patients. We measure patient payment volume as the total dollar volume of transactions between our healthcare services clients and their patients utilizing our payment platform, including via credit and debit cards that we process as a payment facilitator as well as cash and check payments and credit and debit transactions for which Phreesia acts as a gateway to other payment processors.\n\u2022Payment facilitator volume percentage. We define payment facilitator volume percentage as the volume of credit and debit card patient payment volume that we process as a payment facilitator as a percentage of total patient payment volume. Payment facilitator volume is a major driver of our payment processing revenue. We anticipate that our payment facilitator volume percentage will decline slightly over time as we increase our penetration of larger health systems that are less likely to use Phreesia as a payment facilitator.\nResults of operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods:\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and related services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,514 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing fees </td> <td>65,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>49,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life sciences </td> <td>52,518 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>213,233 </td> <td> </td> <td>148,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>42,669 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing expense </td> <td>38,719 </td> <td> </td> <td>28,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>106,421 </td> <td> </td> <td>42,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>52,265 </td> <td> </td> <td>22,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>68,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>40,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation </td> <td>14,985 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization </td> <td>6,317 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses </td> <td>330,050 </td> <td> </td> <td>174,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td>% </td> <td>117 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss </td> <td>(116,817) </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,671) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net </td> <td>(78) </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (expense) income, net </td> <td>(1,084) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,573) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (expense) income, net </td> <td>(1,162) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,572) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before provision for income taxes </td> <td>(117,979) </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,243) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>(182) </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,161) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of statements of operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from providing an integrated SaaS-based software and payment platform for the healthcare industry. We derive revenue from subscription fees and related services generated from our healthcare services clients for access to the Phreesia Platform, payment processing fees based on the levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform, and from digital marketing revenue from life sciences companies to reach, educate and communicate with patients when they are most receptive and actively seeking care.\nOur total revenue consists of the following:\n\u2022Subscription and related services. We primarily generate subscription fees from our healthcare services clients based on the number of healthcare services clients that subscribe to and utilize the Phreesia Platform. Our healthcare services clients are typically billed monthly in arrears, though in some instances, healthcare services clients may opt to be billed quarterly or annually in advance. Subscription fees are typically auto-debited from healthcare services clients' accounts every month. As we target and add larger enterprise healthcare services clients, these clients may choose to contract differently than our typical per healthcare services client subscription model. To the extent we charge in an alternative manner with larger enterprise healthcare services clients, we expect that such a pricing model will recur and, combined with our per healthcare services client subscription fees, will increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nIn addition, we receive certain fees from healthcare services clients for professional services associated with our implementation services as well as travel and expense reimbursements, shipping and handling fees, sales of hardware (PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks), on-site support and training.\n\u2022Payment processing fees. We generate revenue from payment processing fees based on the number of transactions and the levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform. Payment processing fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the total transaction dollar value processed and/or a fee per transaction. Credit and debit patient payment volume processed through our payment facilitator model represented 79% and 81% of our patient payment volume in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remainder of our patient payment volume is composed of credit and debit transactions for which Phreesia acts as a gateway to another payment processor, and cash and check transactions. Utilization trends have been dynamic through the pandemic, diverging from our pre-pandemic seasonality. We expect the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal year 2023.\n\u2022Life sciences. We generate revenue from the sale of digital marketing solutions to life sciences companies. As we expand our healthcare services client base, we increase the number of new patients we can reach to deliver targeted marketing content on behalf of our life sciences clients.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses for implementation and technical support, and infrastructure costs to operate our Platform such as hosting fees and fees paid to various third-party providers for access to their technology, as well as costs to verify insurance eligibility and benefits.\nPayment processing expense\nPayment processing expense consists primarily of interchange fees set by payment card networks and that are ultimately paid to the card-issuing financial institution, assessment fees paid to payment card networks, and fees paid to third-party payment processors and gateways. Payment processing expense may increase as a percentage of payment processing revenue if card networks raise pricing for interchange and assessment fees or if we reduce pricing to our clients.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, commissions, bonuses and benefits costs for our sales and marketing personnel. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for advertising, promotional and other marketing activities, as well as certain fees paid to various third-party partners for sales and lead generation. Advertising is expensed as incurred.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense consists of costs to develop our products and services that do not meet the criteria for capitalization as internal-use software. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses for our development personnel. Research and development expense also includes third-party partner fees and third-party consulting fees, offset by any internal-use software development cost capitalized during the same period.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our executive, finance, legal, security, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also includes software costs to support our finance, legal and human resources operations, insurance costs as well as fees to third-party providers for accounting, legal and consulting services, costs for various non income-based taxes and allocated overhead. We expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and continue to operate as a public company, although we expect such expense to begin to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation represents depreciation expense for PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks, data center and other computer hardware, purchased computer software, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization\nAmortization primarily represents amortization of our capitalized internal-use software related to the Phreesia Platform as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOur other expense and income line items consist of the following:\n\u2022Other (expense) income, net. Other (expense) income, net consists of foreign currency-related losses and gains and other miscellaneous (expense) income.\n\u2022Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest income has not been material to our operations to date.\n\u2022Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on our financing obligations as well as amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs.\nProvision for income taxes\nBased upon our cumulative pre-tax losses in recent years and available evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2022 will not be realized in the near term. Consequently, we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets totaling approximately $97.3 million and $54.6 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. In future periods, if we conclude we have future taxable income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance.\nComparison of fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021\nRevenue (in thousands) Table 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and related services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,514 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,472 </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing fees </td> <td>65,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>49,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,301 </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life sciences </td> <td>52,518 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,783 </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,233 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,556 </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Subscription and related services. Our subscription and related services revenue from health services organizations increased $26.5 million to $95.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $69.0 million for fiscal 2021, primarily due to new health services clients added in fiscal 2022 as well as expansion of and cross-selling to existing health services clients.\n\u2022Payment processing fees. Our revenue from patient payments processed through the Phreesia Platform increased $15.3 million to $65.2 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $49.9 million for fiscal 2021, due to the addition of more healthcare services clients, expansion of existing healthcare services clients, as well as the reduced impact of COVID-19, which had decreased patient visits in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Life sciences. Our revenue from life science clients for digital marketing increased $22.8 million to $52.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $29.7 million for fiscal 2021 due to an increase in new digital marketing solutions programs and deeper patient outreach among the existing programs.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) Table 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal years ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,669 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,208 </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased $19.2 million to $42.7 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $23.5 million for fiscal 2021.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and\namortization, and before stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and other expense (income), net.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\n\u2022Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) the potentially dilutive impact of non-cash stock-based compensation; (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; or (4) interest expense (income), net; and\n\u2022Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the fiscal years ended January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,161) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,292) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (income), net </td> <td>1,084 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,573 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>182 </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>21,302 </td> <td> </td> <td>15,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>36,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,489 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59,023) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,797 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe calculate free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capitalized internal-use software development costs and purchases of property and equipment.\nAdditionally, free cash flow is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.

In connection with this offering, we issued and sold 5,175,000 shares of common stock at an issuance price of $50.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $245,813, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $313.8 million and $218.8 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market accounts and cash on deposit.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our available financial resources from our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk factors.\u201d\nIn the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSilicon Valley Bank facility\nSecond Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn May 5, 2020, we entered into the Second SVB Facility. The Second SVB Facility provided for a revolving line of credit of up to $50.0 million (with options to increase up to $65.0 million). We transferred the $20.0 million outstanding balance on a previous SVB Facility, the First SVB Facility term loan, plus related prepayment fees, into the revolving credit borrowings outstanding under the Second SVB Facility. As of January 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Second SVB Facility was 4.5%. Borrowings under the Second SVB Facility were payable on May 5, 2025. We repaid the outstanding balance on the Second SVB Facility in January 2021. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no outstanding balance on the Second SVB Facility and $50.0 million of available borrowings under the facility. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Second SVB Facility as of January 31, 2022.\nThird SVB Facility\nOn March 28, 2022, we entered into the Third SVB Facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. The Third SVB Facility also reduced the interest rate to the greater of 3.25% or the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 0.5%, amended the annual commitment fees to approximately $0.3 million per year and amended the quarterly fee to 0.15% per annum of the average unused revolving line under the facility.\nIn the event that we terminate the Third SVB Facility prior to the Maturity Date and do not replace the facility with another SVB facility, we are required to pay a termination fee equal to $0.2 million plus a percent of total borrowing capacity, both of which would be reduced based on the amount of time elapsed before the termination.\nAny of our obligations under the Third SVB Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than intellectual property. The Third SVB Facility includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Adjusted Quick Ratio, as defined in the Third SVB Facility.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74,710) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,890 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(65,228) </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,085) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>234,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>150,661 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,031 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nThe primary source of cash from operating activities is cash received from our customers. The primary uses of cash\nfor operating activities are for payroll, payments to suppliers and employees, payments for operating leases, as well as cash paid for interest on our finance leases and other borrowings and cash paid for various sales, property and income taxes.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million, as our cash paid to employees and suppliers exceeded our cash received from customers.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million, as our cash received from customers exceeded our cash paid to employees and suppliers in connection with our normal operations.\nThe change in cash used in operating activities was driven primarily by higher employee compensation costs, primarily due to higher employee headcount as well as an increase in compensation costs for existing employees, partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers driven by higher revenues.\nInvesting activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $65.2 million, principally resulting from $34.4 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of Insignia, $18.4 million of purchases of property and equipment, principally driven by the purchase of data center equipment, as well as $12.4 million of cash paid for capitalized internal-use software.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $25.1 million, principally resulting from capital expenditures, the bulk of which consists of hardware used by clients and the purchase of data center equipment of $11.2 million, capitalized internal-use software costs of $7.3 million and $6.5 million used for the acquisition of QueueDr, net of cash acquired.\nFinancing activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $235.0 million, primarily consisting of $245.8 million in proceeds from the April 2021 offering of our common stock, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and $6.9 million in proceeds from our equity compensation plans, partially offset by $9.0 million used for treasury stock to satisfy tax withholdings on stock compensation awards, $5.3 million used for principal payments on finance leases and financing arrangements and $3.3 million used for payments of acquisition-related liabilities.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $150.7 million, consisting of $174.8 million in proceeds from the October 2020 offering of our common stock, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options as well as $2.0 million in proceeds from an insurance financing arrangement, partially offset by $20.7 million used to repay the outstanding principal balance of the Second SVB Facility, $5.0 million used for treasury stock to satisfy tax withholdings on stock compensation awards, $4.3 million used for principal payments on finance leases and financing arrangements, $0.4 million used for debt and equity issuance and offering costs and $0.2 million for loan facility fee payments. The lender fees incurred in connection with the Second SVB Facility were transferred into the principal balance of the Second SVB Facility. We have included the transfer of the balance of the First SVB\nFacility and the fees that were transferred in connection with the Second SVB Facility within the supplemental non-cash investing and financing information on our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements relate to leases, financing arrangements and contractual purchase commitments and human capital. Refer to Note 4 - Composition of certain financial statement accounts in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on accrued payroll related liabilities. Refer to Note 6 - Finance leases and other debt, Note 10 - Leases and Note 11 - Commitments and contingencies in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on cash requirements for leases, financing arrangements and contractual purchase commitments.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our most significant estimates and judgments involve revenue recognition, the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations, capitalized internal-use software, income taxes, and valuation of our stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue recognition\nWe account for revenue from contracts with clients by applying the requirements of Topic 606, which includes the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a client.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in a contract.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe believe the areas in which we apply the most critical judgements when determining revenue recognition relate to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the assessment of the standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) for each performance obligation identified, the determination of the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price of our contracts with customers and the determination of whether we are the principal or the agent for certain performance obligations.\nDetermination of Performance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Our contracts with customers may include multiple promises to transfer services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and the value delivered to the customer.\nOur subscription and related services revenue includes certain fees from clients for professional services associated with implementation services.\nIn determining whether professional services for implementation are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services and the complexity of interfaces created between systems.\nWe determined that the majority of implementation services were not distinct from the related subscription service because they are proprietary such that they cannot be performed by another entity, because we generally do not sell professional services on a stand-alone basis, and because they are integral to the customer's ability to derive the intended benefit of the subscription service, indicating that the implementation services and related subscription are inputs to a combined output.\nDetermination of Standalone Selling Prices\nWe allocate the transaction price of our customer contracts to the performance obligations within those contracts based on the relative SSP of the performance obligations.\nThe SSP is the price that we would sell a product separately to a customer. The best evidence of this is an observable price from stand-alone sales of that product to similarly situated customers. However, as we do not typically transfer our performance obligations on a standalone basis, but rather we transfer bundles of performance obligations, we use an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate the price a customer would be willing to pay for our performance obligations using historical price information as priced in previous bundled contracts, our cost structure and our expectations for profit margins.\nIn determining SSPs, we stratify the population of customer transactions by product, type, size of customer and geographic area. We typically establish a range of SSPs for each of our performance obligations.\nThe prices we charge for digital messaging solutions provided to life sciences companies have historically been highly variable. We consider pricing to be highly variable if we have a history of selling the services at a wide range of prices to similar customers in similar geographic areas within the same time periods. As the pricing of our digital messaging solutions has historically been highly variable, we use the residual method to estimate the SSP of performance obligations for digital messaging solutions. We estimate the residual SSP of our digital messaging solutions as the total transaction price of the customer contract less the SSPs of the remaining performance obligations pursuant to the contract.\nVariable Consideration\nWe estimate the transaction price at contract inception, including any variable consideration, and we update the estimate each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. When determining the transaction price, we assume the products will be transferred to the customer based on the terms of the existing contract and our assumption does not take into consideration the possibility of a contract being canceled, renewed, or modified.\nWe occasionally provide credits to customers representing adjustments to the transaction price. Known and estimable credits and adjustments represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and generally result in reductions to revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We estimate the amount of variable consideration based on its expected probability-weighted value or its most likely amount. We include variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue when the uncertainty with respect to the variable consideration is resolved. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of January 31, 2022.\nPrincipal vs Agent Considerations\nAs part of our revenue recognition process, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent for the performance obligations in our contracts with customers. When we determine that we are the principal for a performance obligation, we recognize revenue for that performance obligation on a gross basis. When we determine that we are an agent for a performance obligation, we recognize revenue for that performance obligation net of the related costs. In determining whether we are the principal or the agent, we evaluate whether we have control of the services before we transfer the services to the customer by considering whether we are primarily obligated for transferring the services to the customer, whether we have inventory risk for the services before the services are transferred to the customer, and whether we have latitude in establishing prices. We recognize payment processing fees collected from customers as revenue on a gross basis because, as the merchant of record, we control the services before delivery to the customer, we are primarily responsible for the delivery of the services to our customers, we have latitude in establishing pricing with respect to the customer and other terms of service, we have\nsole discretion in selecting the third party to perform the settlement, and we assume the credit risk for the transaction processed. We also have the unilateral ability to accept or reject a transaction based on our established criteria.\nBusiness combinations\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. With the assistance of third-party appraisers, we assess the fair value of the assets acquired in business combinations. The fair value of the acquired licenses and technology was estimated using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of customer relationships was estimated using a multi period excess earnings method. To calculate fair value, we used cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each client grouping. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nWhere applicable, the consideration transferred for business combinations includes the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration. In connection with the QueueDr acquisition, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities within accrued expenses for amounts payable to the selling shareholders based on collections from QueueDr customers. The fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation which uses estimated cash flows and likelihoods of contract cancellation to estimate the expected payout based on collections and active status of the underlying customer contracts. The fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was determined based on inputs which are not readily available in public markets. Therefore, we categorized the liabilities as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In connection with the acquisition of QueueDr, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities with an acquisition-date fair value of $2,240. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2022, we paid a total of $2,574 to settle the contingent consideration liabilities, which represented the maximum amount payable for the contingent consideration liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCapitalized internal-use software\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred for the development of computer software for internal use pursuant to ASC Topic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal use software. These costs relate to the development of our Phreesia Platform. We capitalize the costs during the development of the project, when it is determined that it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities, post-implementation activities, training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our solutions, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nIncome taxes\nAn asset and liability approach is used for financial accounting and reporting of current and deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income or loss. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We follow ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in the interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nWe have accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $332.5 million, and $199.1 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of January 31, 2022, our foreign branch had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.9 million, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and will expire beginning in 2030.\nIn assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset we consider all relevant positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors, including the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.\nDue to uncertainty regarding the ability to realize the benefit of U.S. deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards, we have established valuation allowances to reduce deferred the U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. On the basis of this evaluation, we have recorded valuation allowances of $97.3 million and $54.6 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. As of January 31, 2022, we have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $332.5 million. We have completed a Section 382 study and, as a result of the analysis, it is more likely than not that we have experienced an \"ownership change\". We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. Accordingly, if we earn net taxable income, it is more likely than not that our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability.\nWe review and evaluate tax positions in major jurisdictions and determine whether we record unrecognized tax benefits as reductions of deferred tax assets or as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these unrecognized tax benefits when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There was no outstanding balance for unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2022.\nStock-based compensation for market-based performance stock units (\"PSUs\")\nWe recognize the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards issued as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. We granted market-based PSUs during fiscal 2022.\nEach award vests in zero to two shares of common stock based on our total stockholder return (TSR), relative to a peer group of companies on the Russell 3000 stock index. We estimate the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo Simulation model which projects TSR for Phreesia and each member of the peer group over a performance period of approximately three years. The most critical and judgmental assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the fair value of the PSUs are set forth below:\n\u2022Correlation coefficient: The correlation coefficient measures the correlation of our stock to the stock of the companies in the peer group. This coefficient is used to project the performance of our stock against our peers to estimate projected performance under the plan.\n\u2022Expected volatility: The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of peer companies within our industry which were commensurate with the simulation term assumption.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 3 to our Consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

References to fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 refer to the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nBasis of Presentation\nThis management's discussion and analysis discusses our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021. Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021 for a comparison of the year ended January 31, 2021 to the year ended January 31, 2020.\nFinancial Highlights\nFiscal 2022\n\u2022Total revenue increased 43% to $213.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared with $148.7 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Net loss was $118.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared with $27.3 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA was negative $59.0 million in fiscal 2022, compared with positive $3.8 million in fiscal\n2021.\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million in fiscal 2022, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Free cash flow was negative $105.5 million in fiscal 2022 compared with negative $15.7 million in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Cash and cash equivalents was $313.8 million as of January 31, 2022, compared with $218.8 million as of January 31, 2021.\nFor a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss and free cash flow to cash (used in) provided by operating activities, and for more information as to how we define and calculate such measures, see the section below titled Non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of comprehensive software solutions that improve the operational and financial performance of healthcare organizations by activating patients in their care to optimize patient health outcomes. As evidenced in industry survey reports from KLAS, we have been recognized as a leader based on our integration capabilities with healthcare services client organizations, the broad adoption of our patient intake functionalities, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by overall client satisfaction. Through our SaaS-based technology platform, which we refer to as the Phreesia Platform or our Platform, we offer healthcare services clients a robust suite of integrated solutions that manage patient access, registration, payments and clinical support. Our Platform also provides life sciences companies, patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations with a channel for targeted and direct communication with patients.\nWe serve an array of healthcare services clients of all sizes across over 25 specialties, ranging from single-specialty practices, including internal and family medicine, urology, dermatology, and orthopedics, to large, multi-specialty\ngroups, health systems as well as regional and national payers and other organizations that provide other types of healthcare-related services. Our life sciences revenue is generated from clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries as well as patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations seeking to activate, engage and educate patients about topics critical to their health.\nWe derive revenue from (i) subscription fees from healthcare services clients for access to the Phreesia Platform and related professional services fees, (ii) payment processing fees based on levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform and (iii) fees from life sciences companies to deliver marketing content to patients using the Phreesia Platform. We have strong visibility into our business as the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring subscription fees and re-occurring payment processing fees.\nWe market and sell our products and services to healthcare services clients throughout the United States using a direct sales organization. Our demand generation team develops content and identifies prospects that our sales development team researches and qualifies to generate high-grade, actionable sales leads. Our direct sales force executes on these qualified sales leads, partnering with client services to ensure prospects are educated on the breadth of our capabilities and demonstrable value proposition, with the goal of attracting and retaining clients and expanding their use of our Platform over time. Most of our Platform solutions are contracted pursuant to annual, auto-renewing agreements. Our sales typically involve competitive processes and sales cycles have, on average, varied in duration from three months to six months, depending on the size of the potential client. In addition, through Phreesia University (Phreesia's in-house training program), events, client conferences and webinars, we help our healthcare services clients optimize their businesses and, as a result, support client retention.\nWe also sell products and services to pharmaceutical brands and advertising agencies through our direct sales and\nmarketing teams.\nSince our inception, we have not marketed our products internationally. Accordingly, substantially all of our revenue from historical periods has come from the United States, and our current strategy is to continue to focus substantially all of our sales efforts within the United States.\nOur revenue growth has been primarily organic and reflects our significant addition of new healthcare services clients and increased revenue from existing clients. New healthcare services clients are defined as clients that go live in the applicable period and existing healthcare services clients are defined as clients that go live in any period before the applicable period.\nInvestments in Growth\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, we accelerated hiring and overall investments across all areas of Phreesia to prepare for our anticipated growth in clients and use of our platform. In fiscal 2023 and thereafter, we expect growth in our team and compensation to moderate.\nRecent developments\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic. There continues to be uncertainty as to the duration and extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, and results of operations, as well as macroeconomic conditions, at this time.\nAcquisitions\nOn December 3, 2021, we acquired Insignia Health, LLC (\"Insignia\"), for cash consideration of $37.2 million. Insignia provides coaching and education solutions based on Insignia's exclusive worldwide license to the Patient Activation Measure (\"PAM\"\u00ae). We acquired Insignia to enable us to understand and engage patients in more personalized ways based on their level of activation.\nOn January 8, 2021, we acquired QueueDr Inc (\"QueueDr\"), a SaaS technology company. Over time, we believe the underlying QueueDr technology will enhance our appointments solutions and the overall value of the Phreesia\nplatform to healthcare services clients. The total consideration for the acquisition consists of $5.8 million in cash, $2.1 million of liabilities incurred and $2.2 million in performance-related contingent payments.\nSee Note 16 - Acquisitions in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Insignia and QueueDr.\nSilicon Valley Bank Facility\nOn March 28, 2022, we entered into the First Loan Modification Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Second SVB Facility\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) (as amended, the \"Third SVB Facility\") to increase the borrowing capacity from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. The Third SVB Facility also reduced the interest rate to the greater of 3.25% or the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 0.5%, amended the annual commitment fees to approximately $0.3 million per year and amended the quarterly fee to 0.15% per annum of the average unused revolving line under the facility.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review the following key metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, make strategic business decisions and assess working capital needs. \nPhreesia remains focused on building secure and reliable products that derive a strong return on investment for our clients and implementing them with speed and ease. This strategy continues to enable us to grow our network of healthcare services clients. With the expansion of our operations in the payer market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we have renamed our key metric \"provider clients (average over period)\" to \"healthcare services clients (average over period)\". We have also renamed our key metric \"average revenue per provider client\" to \"average revenue per healthcare services client.\" While we believe the contribution of payers (including payer clients added in connection with the acquisition of Insignia) has not yet been material to our business, we intend to grow our footprint with payers and organizations who provide other types of healthcare-related services, and we believe it is an appropriate time to broaden the definition of these key metrics.\n\u2022Healthcare services clients. We define healthcare services clients as the average number of healthcare services client organizations that generate revenue each month during the applicable period. In cases where we act as a subcontractor providing white-label services to our partner's clients, we treat the contractual relationship as a single healthcare services client. We believe growth in the number of healthcare services clients is a key indicator of the performance of our business and depends, in part, on our ability to successfully develop and market our Platform to healthcare services organizations that are not yet clients. While growth in the number of healthcare services clients is an important indicator of expected revenue growth, it also informs our management of the areas of our business that will require further investment to support expected future healthcare services client growth. For example, as the number of healthcare services clients increases, we may need to add to our customer support team and invest to maintain effectiveness and performance of our Platform and software for our healthcare services clients and their patients.\n\u2022Average revenue per healthcare services client. We define average revenue per healthcare services client as the total subscription and related services and payment processing revenue generated from healthcare services clients in a given period divided by the average number of healthcare services clients that generate revenue each month during that same period. We are focused on continually delivering value to our healthcare services clients and believe that our ability to increase average revenue per healthcare services client is an indicator of the long-term value of the Phreesia platform.\nAdditional Information\n\n\u2022Patient payment volume. We believe that patient payment volume is an indicator of both the underlying health of our healthcare services clients' businesses and the continuing shift of healthcare costs to patients. We measure patient payment volume as the total dollar volume of transactions between our healthcare services clients and their patients utilizing our payment platform, including via credit and debit cards that we process as a payment facilitator as well as cash and check payments and credit and debit transactions for which Phreesia acts as a gateway to other payment processors.\n\u2022Payment facilitator volume percentage. We define payment facilitator volume percentage as the volume of credit and debit card patient payment volume that we process as a payment facilitator as a percentage of total patient payment volume. Payment facilitator volume is a major driver of our payment processing revenue. We anticipate that our payment facilitator volume percentage will decline slightly over time as we increase our penetration of larger health systems that are less likely to use Phreesia as a payment facilitator.\nResults of operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods:\n\nComponents of statements of operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from providing an integrated SaaS-based software and payment platform for the healthcare industry. We derive revenue from subscription fees and related services generated from our healthcare services clients for access to the Phreesia Platform, payment processing fees based on the levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform, and from digital marketing revenue from life sciences companies to reach, educate and communicate with patients when they are most receptive and actively seeking care.\nOur total revenue consists of the following:\n\u2022Subscription and related services. We primarily generate subscription fees from our healthcare services clients based on the number of healthcare services clients that subscribe to and utilize the Phreesia Platform. Our healthcare services clients are typically billed monthly in arrears, though in some instances, healthcare services clients may opt to be billed quarterly or annually in advance. Subscription fees are typically auto-debited from healthcare services clients' accounts every month. As we target and add larger enterprise healthcare services clients, these clients may choose to contract differently than our typical per healthcare services client subscription model. To the extent we charge in an alternative manner with larger enterprise healthcare services clients, we expect that such a pricing model will recur and, combined with our per healthcare services client subscription fees, will increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nIn addition, we receive certain fees from healthcare services clients for professional services associated with our implementation services as well as travel and expense reimbursements, shipping and handling fees, sales of hardware (PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks), on-site support and training.\n\u2022Payment processing fees. We generate revenue from payment processing fees based on the number of transactions and the levels of patient payment volume processed through the Phreesia Platform. Payment processing fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the total transaction dollar value processed and/or a fee per transaction. Credit and debit patient payment volume processed through our payment facilitator model represented 79% and 81% of our patient payment volume in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remainder of our patient payment volume is composed of credit and debit transactions for which Phreesia acts as a gateway to another payment processor, and cash and check transactions. Utilization trends have been dynamic through the pandemic, diverging from our pre-pandemic seasonality. We expect the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal year 2023.\n\u2022Life sciences. We generate revenue from the sale of digital marketing solutions to life sciences companies. As we expand our healthcare services client base, we increase the number of new patients we can reach to deliver targeted marketing content on behalf of our life sciences clients.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses for implementation and technical support, and infrastructure costs to operate our Platform such as hosting fees and fees paid to various third-party providers for access to their technology, as well as costs to verify insurance eligibility and benefits.\nPayment processing expense\nPayment processing expense consists primarily of interchange fees set by payment card networks and that are ultimately paid to the card-issuing financial institution, assessment fees paid to payment card networks, and fees paid to third-party payment processors and gateways. Payment processing expense may increase as a percentage of payment processing revenue if card networks raise pricing for interchange and assessment fees or if we reduce pricing to our clients.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, commissions, bonuses and benefits costs for our sales and marketing personnel. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for advertising, promotional and other marketing activities, as well as certain fees paid to various third-party partners for sales and lead generation. Advertising is expensed as incurred.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense consists of costs to develop our products and services that do not meet the criteria for capitalization as internal-use software. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses for our development personnel. Research and development expense also includes third-party partner fees and third-party consulting fees, offset by any internal-use software development cost capitalized during the same period.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our executive, finance, legal, security, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also includes software costs to support our finance, legal and human resources operations, insurance costs as well as fees to third-party providers for accounting, legal and consulting services, costs for various non income-based taxes and allocated overhead. We expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and continue to operate as a public company, although we expect such expense to begin to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation represents depreciation expense for PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks, data center and other computer hardware, purchased computer software, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization\nAmortization primarily represents amortization of our capitalized internal-use software related to the Phreesia Platform as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOur other expense and income line items consist of the following:\n\u2022Other (expense) income, net. Other (expense) income, net consists of foreign currency-related losses and gains and other miscellaneous (expense) income.\n\u2022Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest income has not been material to our operations to date.\n\u2022Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on our financing obligations as well as amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs.\nProvision for income taxes\nBased upon our cumulative pre-tax losses in recent years and available evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2022 will not be realized in the near term. Consequently, we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets totaling approximately $97.3 million and $54.6 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. In future periods, if we conclude we have future taxable income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance.\nComparison of fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021\nRevenue (in thousands) \n\u2022Subscription and related services. Our subscription and related services revenue from health services organizations increased $26.5 million to $95.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $69.0 million for fiscal 2021, primarily due to new health services clients added in fiscal 2022 as well as expansion of and cross-selling to existing health services clients.\n\u2022Payment processing fees. Our revenue from patient payments processed through the Phreesia Platform increased $15.3 million to $65.2 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $49.9 million for fiscal 2021, due to the addition of more healthcare services clients, expansion of existing healthcare services clients, as well as the reduced impact of COVID-19, which had decreased patient visits in fiscal 2021.\n\u2022Life sciences. Our revenue from life science clients for digital marketing increased $22.8 million to $52.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $29.7 million for fiscal 2021 due to an increase in new digital marketing solutions programs and deeper patient outreach among the existing programs.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) \nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased $19.2 million to $42.7 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $23.5 million for fiscal 2021. The increase resulted primarily from a $13.4 million increase in employee compensation costs driven by higher compensation for existing employees and increased headcount, as well as increases in expenses related to the expansion of our data centers, all driven by client growth.\nStock compensation incurred related to cost of revenue was $2.1 million and $0.6 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nPayment processing expense \nPayment processing expense increased $9.8 million to $38.7 million in fiscal 2022, as compared to $28.9 million for fiscal 2021. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in patient payments processed through the Phreesia Platform driven by an increase in patient visits over the prior year.\nSales and marketing \nSales and marketing expense increased $63.4 million to $106.4 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $43.0 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to a $54.1 million increase in total compensation and benefits costs driven by higher compensation for existing employees and increased headcount, a $6.4 million increase in third-party marketing and advertising costs, as well as higher software expenses.\nStock compensation incurred related to sales and marketing expense was $12.5 million and $3.5 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nResearch and development \nResearch and development expense increased $29.6 million to $52.3 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $22.6 million for fiscal 2021. The increase resulted primarily from a $19.8 million increase in total compensation costs driven by higher compensation for existing employees and increased headcount, a $6.3 million increase in outside services costs, as well as higher software costs.\nStock compensation incurred related to research and development expense was $6.0 million and $2.0 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative \nGeneral and administrative expense increased $28.2 million to $68.7 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $40.5 million for fiscal 2021. The increase resulted primarily from a $17.8 million increase in total compensation and benefits costs driven by higher compensation for existing employees and increased headcount to support our growth as a public company, a $4.2 million increase in outside services costs, as well as a $2.4 million increase in software costs and higher costs for non-income based taxes, recruiting and equipment.\nStock compensation incurred related to general and administrative expense was $15.7 million and $7.4 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nDepreciation \nDepreciation expense increased $5.2 million to $15.0 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $9.8 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher data center depreciation.\nAmortization \nAmortization expense increased $0.2 million to $6.3 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $6.1 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOther (expense) income, net \nOther (expense) income, net changed by $0.1 million to expense of $0.1 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to income of less than $0.1 million for fiscal 2021.\nInterest (expense) income, net \nInterest expense, net decreased $0.5 million to $1.1 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to $1.6 million for fiscal 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances due to repayment of debt with the proceeds of our equity offerings, as well as higher average cash balances.\nProvision for income taxes \nProvision for income taxes increased by $0.1 million to $0.2 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to less than $0.1 million for fiscal 2021. Provision for income taxes relates primarily to utilization of Canadian net operating loss carryforwards and state income taxes.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and\namortization, and before stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and other expense (income), net.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\n\u2022Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) the potentially dilutive impact of non-cash stock-based compensation; (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; or (4) interest expense (income), net; and\n\u2022Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods indicated:\n\nWe calculate free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capitalized internal-use software development costs and purchases of property and equipment.\nAdditionally, free cash flow is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic investments, partnerships and acquisitions and strengthening our financial position.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow from net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated:\n\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOn October 23, 2020, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, in which we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at an issuance price of $32.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $174,800, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and before deducting third-party offering costs of $290.\nOn April 12, 2021, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In connection with this offering, we issued and sold 5,175,000 shares of common stock at an issuance price of $50.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $245,813, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $313.8 million and $218.8 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market accounts and cash on deposit.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our available financial resources from our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk factors.\u201d\nIn the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSilicon Valley Bank facility\nSecond Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn May 5, 2020, we entered into the Second SVB Facility. The Second SVB Facility provided for a revolving line of credit of up to $50.0 million (with options to increase up to $65.0 million). We transferred the $20.0 million outstanding balance on a previous SVB Facility, the First SVB Facility term loan, plus related prepayment fees, into the revolving credit borrowings outstanding under the Second SVB Facility. As of January 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Second SVB Facility was 4.5%. Borrowings under the Second SVB Facility were payable on May 5, 2025. We repaid the outstanding balance on the Second SVB Facility in January 2021. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no outstanding balance on the Second SVB Facility and $50.0 million of available borrowings under the facility. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Second SVB Facility as of January 31, 2022.\nThird SVB Facility\nOn March 28, 2022, we entered into the Third SVB Facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. The Third SVB Facility also reduced the interest rate to the greater of 3.25% or the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 0.5%, amended the annual commitment fees to approximately $0.3 million per year and amended the quarterly fee to 0.15% per annum of the average unused revolving line under the facility.\nIn the event that we terminate the Third SVB Facility prior to the Maturity Date and do not replace the facility with another SVB facility, we are required to pay a termination fee equal to $0.2 million plus a percent of total borrowing capacity, both of which would be reduced based on the amount of time elapsed before the termination.\nAny of our obligations under the Third SVB Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than intellectual property. The Third SVB Facility includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Adjusted Quick Ratio, as defined in the Third SVB Facility.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\n\nOperating activities\nThe primary source of cash from operating activities is cash received from our customers. The primary uses of cash\nfor operating activities are for payroll, payments to suppliers and employees, payments for operating leases, as well as cash paid for interest on our finance leases and other borrowings and cash paid for various sales, property and income taxes.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million, as our cash paid to employees and suppliers exceeded our cash received from customers.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million, as our cash received from customers exceeded our cash paid to employees and suppliers in connection with our normal operations.\nThe change in cash used in operating activities was driven primarily by higher employee compensation costs, primarily due to higher employee headcount as well as an increase in compensation costs for existing employees, partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers driven by higher revenues.\nInvesting activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $65.2 million, principally resulting from $34.4 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of Insignia, $18.4 million of purchases of property and equipment, principally driven by the purchase of data center equipment, as well as $12.4 million of cash paid for capitalized internal-use software.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $25.1 million, principally resulting from capital expenditures, the bulk of which consists of hardware used by clients and the purchase of data center equipment of $11.2 million, capitalized internal-use software costs of $7.3 million and $6.5 million used for the acquisition of QueueDr, net of cash acquired.\nFinancing activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $235.0 million, primarily consisting of $245.8 million in proceeds from the April 2021 offering of our common stock, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and $6.9 million in proceeds from our equity compensation plans, partially offset by $9.0 million used for treasury stock to satisfy tax withholdings on stock compensation awards, $5.3 million used for principal payments on finance leases and financing arrangements and $3.3 million used for payments of acquisition-related liabilities.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $150.7 million, consisting of $174.8 million in proceeds from the October 2020 offering of our common stock, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options as well as $2.0 million in proceeds from an insurance financing arrangement, partially offset by $20.7 million used to repay the outstanding principal balance of the Second SVB Facility, $5.0 million used for treasury stock to satisfy tax withholdings on stock compensation awards, $4.3 million used for principal payments on finance leases and financing arrangements, $0.4 million used for debt and equity issuance and offering costs and $0.2 million for loan facility fee payments. The lender fees incurred in connection with the Second SVB Facility were transferred into the principal balance of the Second SVB Facility. We have included the transfer of the balance of the First SVB\nFacility and the fees that were transferred in connection with the Second SVB Facility within the supplemental non-cash investing and financing information on our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements relate to leases, financing arrangements and contractual purchase commitments and human capital. Refer to Note 4 - Composition of certain financial statement accounts in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on accrued payroll related liabilities. Refer to Note 6 - Finance leases and other debt, Note 10 - Leases and Note 11 - Commitments and contingencies in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on cash requirements for leases, financing arrangements and contractual purchase commitments.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our most significant estimates and judgments involve revenue recognition, the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations, capitalized internal-use software, income taxes, and valuation of our stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue recognition\nWe account for revenue from contracts with clients by applying the requirements of Topic 606, which includes the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a client.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in a contract.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe believe the areas in which we apply the most critical judgements when determining revenue recognition relate to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the assessment of the standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) for each performance obligation identified, the determination of the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price of our contracts with customers and the determination of whether we are the principal or the agent for certain performance obligations.\nDetermination of Performance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Our contracts with customers may include multiple promises to transfer services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and the value delivered to the customer.\nOur subscription and related services revenue includes certain fees from clients for professional services associated with implementation services.\nIn determining whether professional services for implementation are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services and the complexity of interfaces created between systems.\nWe determined that the majority of implementation services were not distinct from the related subscription service because they are proprietary such that they cannot be performed by another entity, because we generally do not sell professional services on a stand-alone basis, and because they are integral to the customer's ability to derive the intended benefit of the subscription service, indicating that the implementation services and related subscription are inputs to a combined output.\nDetermination of Standalone Selling Prices\nWe allocate the transaction price of our customer contracts to the performance obligations within those contracts based on the relative SSP of the performance obligations.\nThe SSP is the price that we would sell a product separately to a customer. The best evidence of this is an observable price from stand-alone sales of that product to similarly situated customers. However, as we do not typically transfer our performance obligations on a standalone basis, but rather we transfer bundles of performance obligations, we use an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate the price a customer would be willing to pay for our performance obligations using historical price information as priced in previous bundled contracts, our cost structure and our expectations for profit margins.\nIn determining SSPs, we stratify the population of customer transactions by product, type, size of customer and geographic area. We typically establish a range of SSPs for each of our performance obligations.\nThe prices we charge for digital messaging solutions provided to life sciences companies have historically been highly variable. We consider pricing to be highly variable if we have a history of selling the services at a wide range of prices to similar customers in similar geographic areas within the same time periods. As the pricing of our digital messaging solutions has historically been highly variable, we use the residual method to estimate the SSP of performance obligations for digital messaging solutions. We estimate the residual SSP of our digital messaging solutions as the total transaction price of the customer contract less the SSPs of the remaining performance obligations pursuant to the contract.\nVariable Consideration\nWe estimate the transaction price at contract inception, including any variable consideration, and we update the estimate each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. When determining the transaction price, we assume the products will be transferred to the customer based on the terms of the existing contract and our assumption does not take into consideration the possibility of a contract being canceled, renewed, or modified.\nWe occasionally provide credits to customers representing adjustments to the transaction price. Known and estimable credits and adjustments represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and generally result in reductions to revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We estimate the amount of variable consideration based on its expected probability-weighted value or its most likely amount. We include variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue when the uncertainty with respect to the variable consideration is resolved. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of January 31, 2022.\nPrincipal vs Agent Considerations\nAs part of our revenue recognition process, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent for the performance obligations in our contracts with customers. When we determine that we are the principal for a performance obligation, we recognize revenue for that performance obligation on a gross basis. When we determine that we are an agent for a performance obligation, we recognize revenue for that performance obligation net of the related costs. In determining whether we are the principal or the agent, we evaluate whether we have control of the services before we transfer the services to the customer by considering whether we are primarily obligated for transferring the services to the customer, whether we have inventory risk for the services before the services are transferred to the customer, and whether we have latitude in establishing prices. We recognize payment processing fees collected from customers as revenue on a gross basis because, as the merchant of record, we control the services before delivery to the customer, we are primarily responsible for the delivery of the services to our customers, we have latitude in establishing pricing with respect to the customer and other terms of service, we have\nsole discretion in selecting the third party to perform the settlement, and we assume the credit risk for the transaction processed. We also have the unilateral ability to accept or reject a transaction based on our established criteria.\nBusiness combinations\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. With the assistance of third-party appraisers, we assess the fair value of the assets acquired in business combinations. The fair value of the acquired licenses and technology was estimated using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of customer relationships was estimated using a multi period excess earnings method. To calculate fair value, we used cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each client grouping. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nWhere applicable, the consideration transferred for business combinations includes the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration. In connection with the QueueDr acquisition, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities within accrued expenses for amounts payable to the selling shareholders based on collections from QueueDr customers. The fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation which uses estimated cash flows and likelihoods of contract cancellation to estimate the expected payout based on collections and active status of the underlying customer contracts. The fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was determined based on inputs which are not readily available in public markets. Therefore, we categorized the liabilities as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In connection with the acquisition of QueueDr, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities with an acquisition-date fair value of $2,240. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2022, we paid a total of $2,574 to settle the contingent consideration liabilities, which represented the maximum amount payable for the contingent consideration liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCapitalized internal-use software\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred for the development of computer software for internal use pursuant to ASC Topic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal use software. These costs relate to the development of our Phreesia Platform. We capitalize the costs during the development of the project, when it is determined that it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities, post-implementation activities, training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our solutions, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nIncome taxes\nAn asset and liability approach is used for financial accounting and reporting of current and deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income or loss. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We follow ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in the interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nWe have accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $332.5 million, and $199.1 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of January 31, 2022, our foreign branch had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.9 million, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and will expire beginning in 2030.\nIn assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset we consider all relevant positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors, including the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.\nDue to uncertainty regarding the ability to realize the benefit of U.S. deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards, we have established valuation allowances to reduce deferred the U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. On the basis of this evaluation, we have recorded valuation allowances of $97.3 million and $54.6 million as of January 31, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. As of January 31, 2022, we have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $332.5 million. We have completed a Section 382 study and, as a result of the analysis, it is more likely than not that we have experienced an \"ownership change\". We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. Accordingly, if we earn net taxable income, it is more likely than not that our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability.\nWe review and evaluate tax positions in major jurisdictions and determine whether we record unrecognized tax benefits as reductions of deferred tax assets or as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these unrecognized tax benefits when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There was no outstanding balance for unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2022.\nStock-based compensation for market-based performance stock units (\"PSUs\")\nWe recognize the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards issued as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. We granted market-based PSUs during fiscal 2022.\nEach award vests in zero to two shares of common stock based on our total stockholder return (TSR), relative to a peer group of companies on the Russell 3000 stock index. We estimate the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo Simulation model which projects TSR for Phreesia and each member of the peer group over a performance period of approximately three years. The most critical and judgmental assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the fair value of the PSUs are set forth below:\n\u2022Correlation coefficient: The correlation coefficient measures the correlation of our stock to the stock of the companies in the peer group. This coefficient is used to project the performance of our stock against our peers to estimate projected performance under the plan.\n\u2022Expected volatility: The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of peer companies within our industry which were commensurate with the simulation term assumption.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 3 to our Consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

to $27.3 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased operating expenses.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA was negative $59.0 million in fiscal 2022 versus positive $3.8 million in fiscal 2021.\n\n- Cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million in fiscal 2022 compared to cash provided of $2.9 million in fiscal 2021, driven by higher employee compensation costs. \n\n- As of January 31, 2022, the company had $313.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n- Key operating metrics like healthcare services clients and average revenue per client showed solid growth year-over-year.\n\n- The company continued investing significantly in growth across sales, marketing, R&D and G&A functions. \n\n- Acquisitions of Insignia Health and QueueDr expanded capabilities in patient engagement and appointments.\n\n- The credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank was expanded to provide additional liquidity.\n\nIn summary, Phreesia showed strong revenue growth but net losses widened as the company invested heavily for growth. The company maintains a solid cash position to fund operations and strategic initiatives."}
