This section provides a general description of our business, as well as other matters that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition and in anticipating future trends.\nResults of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our segments are MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides a discussion of our financial condition, as well as an analysis of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes summaries of (i) our primary sources of liquidity and (ii) our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements that existed at June 30, 2019.\nSeasonality of Our Business. This section discusses the seasonal performance of our MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment segments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies. This section includes a discussion of accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a sports and entertainment business comprised of dynamic and powerful assets and brands. The Company is comprised of two business segments: MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, which is built on a foundation of iconic venues and compelling content, including live sports and entertainment events that we create, produce and present. The Company conducts\na significant portion of its operations at venues that it either owns or operates under long-term leases. The Company owns Madison Square Garden ( The Garden\u201d) and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre in Chicago. In addition, the Company leases Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\nDescription of Our Segments\nMSG Entertainment\nOur MSG Entertainment segment, which represented approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019, is one of the country's leaders in live entertainment. MSG Entertainment produces, presents and hosts live entertainment events, including (i) concerts and (ii) other live events such as family shows, performing arts events and special events, in our diverse collection of venues. Those venues include The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum, and The Chicago Theatre. The scope of our collection of venues enables us to showcase acts that cover a wide spectrum of genres and popular appeal.\nAlthough we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows in which case we have economic risk relating to the event.\nMSG Entertainment also creates, produces and/or presents live productions that are performed in the Company's venues. This includes the Christmas Spectacular, which is the top grossing live holiday family show in North America, featuring the Rockettes. The Christmas Spectacular has been performed at Radio City Music Hall for 86 years and more than one million tickets were sold for performances during the 2018 holiday season.\nIn July 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. This was followed in January 2017 by the Company's purchase of a controlling interest in TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands. These companies are part of the MSG Entertainment segment. In November 2017, the Company acquired a 100% controlling interest in Obscura, a creative studio, recognized for its work in designing and developing next-generation immersive experiences. Revenues generated by Obscura's third-party production business (and related costs) are reflected in the MSG Entertainment segment. The Company has decided to wind down this third-party productions business to focus on MSG Sphere development. Any costs incurred by Obscura that are associated with MSG Sphere development that are not capitalized are reported in Corporate and Other\u201d.\nRevenue Sources\nOur primary sources of revenue in our MSG Entertainment segment are ticket sales to our audiences for live events that we produce or promote/co-promote and license fees for our venues paid by third-party promoters in connection with events that we do not produce or promote/co-promote. We also generate revenue from other sources, including facility and ticketing fees, concessions, sponsorships and signage, a portion of suite license fees at The Garden, merchandising and tours at certain of our venues. The amount of revenue and expense we record in our MSG Entertainment segment for a given event depends to a significant extent on whether we are promoting or co-promoting the event or are licensing our venue to a third party. In addition, a significant component of the MSG Entertainment segment revenues are generated by the TAO Group through entertainment dining and nightlife offerings, which primarily consist of food and beverage sales and venue management fees.\nTicket Sales and Suite Licenses\nFor our productions and for entertainment events in our venues that we promote, we recognize revenues from the sale of tickets to our audiences. We sell tickets to the public through our box office, via our web sites and ticketing agencies and through group sales. The amount of revenue we earn from ticket sales depends on the number of shows and the mix of events that we promote, the capacity of the venue used, the extent to which we can sell to fully utilize the capacity and our ticket prices. During the fiscal year 2017, we implemented significant changes to how we sell Christmas Spectacular tickets. By eliminating block sales to third party brokers, we brought a significant number of tickets back in-house, which created the opportunity for more customers to buy tickets to the production directly from us.\nThe Garden has 21 Event Level suites, 58 Lexus Madison Level suites, and 18 Signature Level suites. Suite licenses at The Garden are generally sold to corporate customers pursuant to multi-year licenses. Under standard suite licenses, the licensees pay an annual license fee, which varies depending on the location of the suite. The license fee includes, for each seat in the suite, tickets for events at The Garden for which tickets are sold to the general public, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, suite holders separately pay for food and beverage service in their suites at The Garden. Revenues from the sale of suite licenses are shared between our MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments.\nVenue License Fees\nFor entertainment events held at our venues that we do not produce, promote or co-promote, we typically earn revenue from venue license fees charged to the third-party promoter of the event. The amount of license fees we charge varies by venue, as well as by the size of the production and the number of days utilized, among other factors. Our fees typically include both the cost of renting space in our venues and costs for providing event staff, such as front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including stagehands, electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers and security as well as production services such as staging, lighting and sound.\nFacility and Ticketing Fees\nFor all public and ticketed entertainment events held in our venues, we also earn additional revenues on substantially all tickets sold, whether we promote/co-promote the event or license the venue to a third party. These revenues are earned in the form of certain fees and assessments, including the facility fee we charge, and vary by venue.\nConcessions\nWe sell food and beverages during substantially all entertainment events held at our venues. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of our concession revenues, we also generate revenue from catering for our suites at The Garden.\nMerchandise\nWe earn revenues from the sale of merchandise relating to our proprietary productions and other live entertainment events that take place at our venues. The majority of our merchandise revenues are generated through on-site sales during performances of our productions and other live events. We also generate revenues from the sales of our Christmas Spectacular merchandise, such as ornaments and apparel, through traditional retail channels. Typically, revenues from our merchandise sales at our non-proprietary events relate to sales of merchandise provided by the artist, the producer or promoter of the event and are generally subject to a revenue sharing arrangement.\nVenue Signage and Sponsorship\nWe earn revenues through the sale of signage space and sponsorship rights in connection with our venues, productions and other live entertainment events. Signage revenues generally involve the sale of advertising space at The Garden during entertainment events and otherwise in our venues.\nSponsorship rights may require us to use the name, logos and other trademarks of sponsors in our advertising and in promotions for our venues, productions and other live entertainment events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our productions, events and venues in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in our venues or in the community.\nEntertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings\nWe earn revenues from entertainment dining and nightlife offerings through our operations of the TAO Group's restaurants and nightlife and hospitality venues. These revenues primarily consist of food and beverage sales and banquet hosting services at TAO Group leased restaurants and nightclubs. In addition, we earn fees from our real estate partners for operating certain of our restaurants and nightclubs.\nExpenses\nOur MSG Entertainment segment's principal expenses are payments made to performers of our productions, staging costs and day-of-event costs associated with events, and advertising costs. We charge a portion of our actual expenses associated with the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of our venues, along with a portion of our corporate expenses, to our MSG Entertainment segment. However, the operating results of our MSG Entertainment segment benefit from the fact that no rent is charged to the segment for use of the Company's owned venues. We do not allocate to our segments depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden or the Forum.\nPerformer Payments\nOur productions are performed by talented actors, dancers, singers, musicians and entertainers. In order to attract and retain this talent, we are required to pay our performers an amount that is commensurate with both their abilities and the demand for their services from other entertainment companies. Our productions typically feature ensemble casts (such as the Rockettes), where most of our performers are paid based on a standard scale,\u201d pursuant to CBAs we negotiate with the performers' unions. Certain performers, however, have individually negotiated contracts.\nStaging Costs\nStaging costs for our proprietary events as well as other events that we promote include the costs of sets, lighting, display technologies, special effects, sound and all of the other technical aspects involved in presenting a live entertainment event. These costs vary substantially depending on the nature of the particular show, but tend to be highest for large-scale theatrical productions, such as the Christmas Spectacular. For concerts we promote, the performer usually provides a fully-produced show. Along with performer salaries, the staging costs associated with a given production are an important factor in the determination of ticket prices.\nDay-of-Event Costs\nFor days on which MSG Entertainment stages its productions, promotes an event or provides one of our venues to a third-party promoter under a license fee arrangement, the event is charged the variable costs associated with such event, including box office staff, stagehands, ticket takers, ushers, security, and other similar expenses. In situations where we provide our venues to a third-party promoter under a license fee arrangement, day-of-event costs are typically included in the license fees charged to the promoter.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nWe incur significant costs promoting our productions and other events through various advertising campaigns, including advertising on outdoor platforms and in newspapers, on television and radio, and on social and digital platforms. In light of the intense competition for entertainment events, such expenditures are a necessity to drive interest in our productions and encourage members of the public to purchase tickets to our shows.\nEntertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings Costs\nThrough our ownership in the operations of the TAO Group restaurants and nightlife and hospitality venues, we incur costs for providing food and beverage as well as banquet hosting services to our customers. Our dining and nightlife offering costs primarily include the following:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>labor costs, consisting of restaurant management salaries, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related items, including taxes and fringe benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>food and beverage costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating costs, consisting of maintenance, utilities, bank and credit card charges, and any other restaurant-level expenses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, insurance premiums and taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Factors Affecting Operating Results\nThe operating results of our MSG Entertainment segment are largely dependent on our ability to attract concerts and other live events to our venues, as well as the continuing popularity of the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall. Our MSG Entertainment segment recognized an operating loss during the year ended June 30, 2017, which includes a $33,629 write-off of deferred production costs related to the New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes ( New York Spectacular\u201d).\nOur MSG Entertainment segment's future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of these conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower demand for our entertainment and nightlife offerings, suite licenses and tickets to our live productions, concerts, family shows and other events, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, as well as lower levels of sponsorship and venue signage. These conditions may also affect the number of concerts, family shows and other events that take place in the future. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to explore additional opportunities to expand our presence in the entertainment industry. Any new investment may not initially contribute to operating income, but is intended to become operationally profitable over time. Our results will also be affected by investments in, and the success of, new productions.\nMSG Sports\nOur MSG Sports segment, which represented approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019, owns and operates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (the Knicks\u201d), a founding member of the NBA, and the New York Rangers (the Rangers\u201d), one of the original six\u201d franchises of the NHL. MSG Sports also owns and operates the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (the AHL\u201d), which is the primary player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Company owns and operates an NBA G League\nteam, named the Westchester Knicks, which plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY. The Knicks and Rangers play their home games at The Garden. In January 2019, the Company sold the New York Liberty (the Liberty\u201d) of the Women's National Basketball Association (the WNBA\u201d). For all periods through the sale date, MSG Sports includes the Liberty. Our professional sports franchises are collectively referred to herein as our sports teams.\u201d The MSG Sports segment also includes CLG, a premier North American esports organization, and Knicks Gaming, MSG's franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League. CLG and Knicks Gaming are collectively referred to herein as our esports teams,\u201d and, together with our sports teams, our teams.\u201d In addition, our sports business also promotes, produces and/or presents a broad array of live sporting events including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, and college wrestling.\nRevenue Sources\nWe earn revenue in our MSG Sports segment from several primary sources: ticket sales and a portion of suite rental fees at The Garden, our share of distributions from NHL and NBA league-wide national and international television contracts and other league-wide revenue sources, venue signage and other sponsorships, concessions and merchandising. Our MSG Sports segment also earns substantial fees from MSG Networks for the local media rights to telecast the games of our professional sports teams. We also earn venue license fees, primarily from the rental of The Garden to third-party promoters or conferences holding sporting events at our arena. The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our sports teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our sports teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenue derives from rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our sports teams and our ability to attract other compelling sports content.\nTicket Sales, Suite Licenses, Venue Licenses, Facility and Ticketing Fees\nTicket sales have historically constituted the largest single source of revenue for our MSG Sports segment. We sell tickets to our sports teams' home games through season tickets, which are typically held by long-term season subscribers, through group sales, and through single-game tickets, which are purchased by fans either individually or in multi-game packages. The prices of our tickets vary, depending on the sports team and the location of the seats. We generally review and set the price of our tickets before the start of each team's season. During the fiscal year 2017 we made changes to our ticketing polices, resulting in fewer full season tickets sold and more sales of individual and group tickets, as well as partial season plans.\nRevenues from the sale of suite licenses are shared between the MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments. See - MSG Entertainment - Revenue Sources\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition to our sports teams' home games, we also present or host other live sporting events at our venues. When the Company acts as the promoter or co-promoter of such events, the Company typically earns revenues from ticket sales and incurs expenses associated with the event. When these events are promoted by third-party promoters, the Company typically earns venue license fees from the promoter for use of our venues. When licensing our venues, the amount recorded as revenue also includes the event's variable costs such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staffs, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security and building services, which we pass along to the promoter. The number and mix of live sporting events, including whether we are the promoter or co-promoter of an event or license our venues to a third-party promoter, could have a significant impact on the level of revenues and expenses that we record in our MSG Sports segment.\nOur MSG Sports segment also earns revenues in the form of certain fees added to ticket prices for events held at our venues, regardless of whether we act as promoter or co-promoter for such events. This currently includes a facility fee the Company charges on tickets it sells to all events at our venues, except for our sports teams' season tickets and certain other limited exceptions.\nMedia Rights\nWe earn revenue from the licensing of media rights for our sports teams' home and away games and also through the receipt of our share of fees paid for league-wide media rights, which are awarded under contracts negotiated and administered by each league.\nThe Company and MSG Networks are parties to media rights agreements covering the local telecast rights for the Knicks and Rangers. The financial success of our MSG Sports segment is significantly dependent on the rights fees we receive from MSG Networks in connection with the telecast of our Knicks and Rangers games.\nNational and international telecast arrangements differ by league. Fees paid by telecasters under these arrangements are pooled by each league and then generally shared equally among all teams.\nVenue Signage and Sponsorships and Ad Sales Commission\nWe earn revenues through the sale of signage space at The Garden and sponsorship rights in connection with our teams and certain other sporting events. Our strategy is to develop marketing partnerships with world-class brands by creating customized platforms that achieve our partners' business objectives. Signage sales generally involve the sale of advertising space within The Garden during our sports teams' home games and include the sale of signage on the ice and on the boards of the hockey rink during Rangers games, courtside during Knicks games, and/or on the various scoreboards and display panels at The Garden. We offer both television camera-visible and non-camera-visible signage space.\nSponsorship rights generally require us to use the name, logos and other trademarks of a sponsor in our advertising and in promotions for our teams and during our sports events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our teams and venues in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in The Garden or in the community.\nThe Company and MSG Networks are parties to an advertising sales representation agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we have the exclusive right and obligation to sell advertising availabilities of MSG Networks. We are entitled to and earn commission revenue on such sales. The expense associated with advertising personnel, which was transferred from MSG Networks in connection with this advertising sales representation agreement, is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nConcessions\nWe sell food and beverages during all sporting events held at our venues. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of our concession revenues, we also provide higher-end dining at our full service restaurant and clubs as well as catering for suites at The Garden.\nMerchandise\nWe earn revenues from the sale of our teams' merchandise both through the in-venue (and in some cases, online) sale of items bearing the logos or other marks of our teams and through our share of sports league distributions of royalties and other revenues from the sports leagues' licensing of team and sports league trademarks, which revenues are generally shared equally among the teams in the sports leagues. By agreement among the teams, each of the sports leagues in which we operate acts as an agent for the sports teams to license their logos and other marks, as well as the marks of the leagues, subject to certain rights retained by the teams to license these marks within their arenas and the geographic areas in which they operate.\nExpenses\nThe most significant expenses in our MSG Sports segment are player and other team personnel salaries and charges for transactions relating to players for career-ending and season-ending injuries, trades, and waivers and contract termination costs of players and other team personnel, including team executives. We also incur costs for travel, player insurance, league operating assessments (including a 6% NBA assessment on regular season ticket sales), NHL and NBA revenue sharing and NBA luxury tax. We charge a portion of our actual expenses associated with the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of our venues, along with a portion of our corporate expenses, to our MSG Sports segment. However, the operating results of our MSG Sports segment benefit from the fact that no rent is charged to the segment for use of the Company's owned venues. We do not allocate to our segments depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden or the Forum.\nPlayer Salaries, Escrow System/Revenue Sharing and NBA Luxury Tax\nThe amount we pay an individual player is typically determined by negotiation between the player (typically represented by an agent) and us, and is generally influenced by the player's past performance, the amounts paid to players with comparable past performance by other sports teams and restrictions in the CBAs, including the salary floors and caps and NBA luxury tax. The leagues' CBAs typically contain restrictions on when players may move between league clubs following expiration of their contracts and what rights their current and former clubs have.\nNBA CBA. The NBA CBA expires after the 2023-24 season (although the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association ( NBPA\u201d) each have the right to terminate the CBA following the 2022-23 season). The NBA CBA contains a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team's aggregate player salaries with a requirement that the team pay any deficiency to the players on its roster) and a soft\u201d salary cap (i.e., a cap on each team's aggregate player salaries but with certain exceptions that enable teams to pay players more, sometimes substantially more, than the cap).\nNBA Luxury Tax. Amounts in this paragraph are in thousands, except for luxury tax rates. The NBA CBA provides for a luxury tax that is applicable to all teams with aggregate player salaries exceeding a threshold that is set prior to each season based upon projected league-wide revenues (as defined under the CBA). The luxury tax rates for teams with aggregate player salaries above such threshold start at $1.50 for each $1.00 of team salary above the threshold up to $5,000 and scale up to $3.25 for each $1.00 of team salary that is from $15,000 to $20,000 over the threshold, and an additional tax rate increment of $0.50 applies for each additional $5,000 (or part thereof) of team salary in excess of $20,000 over the threshold. In addition, for teams that are taxpayers in at least three of four previous seasons, the above tax rates are increased by $1.00 for each increment. Fifty percent of the aggregate luxury tax payments is a funding source for the revenue sharing plan and the remaining 50% of such payments is distributed in equal shares to non-taxpaying teams. For the 2018-19, 2017-18, and 2016-17 seasons, the Knicks were not a luxury tax payer and we recorded approximately $3,100, $2,200, and $500, respectively, of luxury tax proceeds from tax-paying teams. Tax obligations for years beyond the 2018-19 season will be subject to contractual player payroll obligations and corresponding NBA luxury tax thresholds. The Company recognizes the estimated amount associated with luxury tax expense or the amount it expects to receive as a non-tax paying team, if applicable, on a straight-line basis over the NBA regular season as a component of direct operating expenses.\nNBA Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NBA CBA also provides that players collectively receive a designated percentage of league-wide revenues (net of certain direct expenses) as compensation (approximately 51%), and the teams retain the remainder. The percentage of league-wide revenues paid as compensation and retained by the teams does not apply evenly across all teams and, accordingly, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Knicks' revenues than other NBA teams. Throughout each season, NBA teams withhold 10% of each player's salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league's aggregate player compensation exceeds the designated percentage of league-wide revenues, some or all of such escrowed amounts are distributed equally to all NBA teams. In the event that the league's aggregate player compensation is below the designated percentage of league-wide revenues, the teams will remit the shortfall to the NBPA for distribution to the players.\nThe NBA also has a revenue sharing plan that generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds to teams with below-average net revenues (as defined in the plan), subject to reduction or elimination based on individual team market size and profitability. The plan is funded by a combination of disproportionate contributions from teams with above-average net revenues, subject to certain profit-based limits (each as defined in the plan); 50% of aggregate league-wide luxury tax proceeds (see above); and collective league sources, if necessary. Additional amounts may also be distributed on a discretionary basis, funded by assessments on playoff ticket revenues and through collective league sources.\nWe record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from the escrow. Our net provision for these items for the year ended June 30, 2019 was approximately $36,000. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 season may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NBA teams for the season and other factors.\nNHL CBA. The NHL CBA expires September 15, 2022 (although the NHL and NHL Players' Association each have the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2019-20 season). The NHL CBA provides for a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team's aggregate player salaries) and a hard\u201d salary cap (i.e., teams may not exceed a stated maximum that was negotiated for the 2013-14 season and has been adjusted each season thereafter based upon league-wide revenues).\nNHL Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NHL CBA provides that each season the players receive as player compensation 50% of that season's league-wide revenues. Because the aggregate amount to be paid to the players is based upon league-wide revenues and not on a team-by-team basis, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Rangers' revenues than other NHL teams pay of their own revenues. In order to implement the salary cap system, NHL teams withhold a portion of each player's salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league's aggregate player compensation for a season exceeds the designated percentage (50%) of that season's league-wide revenues, the excess is retained by the league. Any such excess funds are distributed to all teams in equal shares.\nThe NHL CBA also provides for a revenue sharing plan. The plan generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds approximating 6.055% of league-wide revenues to certain qualifying lower-revenue teams and is funded as follows: (a) 50% from contributions by the top ten revenue earning teams (based on pre-season and regular season revenues) in accordance with a formula; (b) then from payments by teams participating in the playoffs, with each team contributing 35% of its gate receipts for each home playoff game; and (c) the remainder from centrally-generated NHL sources. We record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from the escrow. Our net provisions for these items for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $23,300 and $21,100, respectively. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 and 2017-18 seasons may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NHL teams for the season and other factors.\nOther Team Operating Expenses\nOur teams also pay expenses associated with day-to-day operations, including for travel, equipment maintenance and player insurance. Direct variable day-of-event costs incurred at The Garden, such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security, and event production are charged to our MSG Sports segment.\nOperating costs of the Company's training center in Greenburgh, NY are also charged to our MSG Sports segment. The operation of the Hartford Wolf Pack is also a net Rangers player development expense for our MSG Sports segment.\nAs members of the NBA and NHL, the Knicks and Rangers, respectively, are also subject to league assessments. The governing bodies of each league determine the amount of each season's league assessments that are required from each member team. The NBA imposed on each team a 6% assessment on regular season ticket revenue.\nOur MSG Sports segment also incurs costs associated with VIP amenities provided to certain ticket holders.\nOther Expenses\nMSG Sports also incurs selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nThe operating results of our MSG Sports segment are largely dependent on the continued popularity and/or on-ice or on-court competitiveness of our Rangers and Knicks teams, which have a direct effect on ticket sales for the teams' home games and are each team's largest single source of revenue, as well as our ability to attract high-caliber sporting events. As with other sports teams, the competitive positions of our sports teams depend primarily on our ability to develop, obtain and retain talented players, for which we compete with other professional sports teams. A significant factor in our ability to attract and retain talented players is player compensation. Our MSG Sports segment results reflect the impact of high costs for player salaries (including NBA luxury tax, if any) and salaries of non-player team personnel. In addition, we have incurred significant charges for costs associated with transactions relating to players on our sports teams for season-ending and career-ending injuries and for trades, waivers and contract terminations of players and other team personnel, including team executives. Waiver and termination costs reflect our efforts to improve the competitiveness of our sports teams. These transactions can result in significant charges as the Company recognizes the estimated ultimate costs of these events in the period in which they occur, although amounts due to these individuals are generally paid over their remaining contract terms. For example, the expense for these items was $53,134, $27,514 and $42,337 for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenses add to the volatility of the results of our MSG Sports segment. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to improve the overall quality of our sports teams and our efforts may result in continued significant expenses and charges. Such expenses and charges may result in future operating losses for our MSG Sports segment although it is not possible to predict their timing or amount. Our MSG Sports segment's performance has been, and may in the future be, impacted by work stoppages. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - General Risks - Organized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn addition to our MSG Sports segment's future performance being dependent upon the continued popularity and/or on-ice or on-court competitiveness of our Rangers and Knicks teams, it is also dependent on general economic conditions, in particular those in the New York City metropolitan area, and the effect of these conditions on our customers. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations as it may lead to lower demand for suite licenses and tickets to the games of our sports teams, which would also negatively affect merchandise and concession sales, as well as decrease levels of sponsorship and venue signage revenues. These conditions may also affect the number of other live sporting events that this segment is able to present.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nAdoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers\nThe Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606. As a result, the Company's revenues were lower by $22,996 and direct operating expenses were lower by $26,239 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in net decreases in MSG Entertainment's revenues and direct operating expenses of $24,347 and $24,545, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the application of principal versus agent revenue recognition on event-related food, beverage and merchandise activities. For the MSG Sports' operating results, the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in a net increase in revenues of $1,351 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily associated with professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues. In addition, the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in a decrease in direct operating expenses of $1,694 for the year ended June 30, 2019, due to the application of principal versus agent revenue recognition on event-related food, beverage and merchandise activities.\nPrior year period results have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC Topic 606 and, therefore, the Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 are not directly comparable to results for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nUnder ASC Topic 606, the suite license revenues for the Company's MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments are now recognized proportionately as events at The Garden take place, as opposed to being recognized on a straight-line basis over the fiscal year under the prior standard. In addition, most of local media rights revenue is now recognized over the course of the regular season, as opposed to being recognized on a straight-line basis over the fiscal year under the prior standard.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Note 3. Revenue Recognition for further discussion of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nRenewal of a Ticketing Agreement\nThe Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the recognition of revenue for events that took place during prior year due to the renewal of the agreement with the Company's ticketing platform provider during fiscal year 2019. The following table presents the impact on the Company's consolidated revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 from events in the prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. Table 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Entertainment segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Sports segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MSG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Expenses and Venue Operating Costs\nThe Company allocates certain corporate costs and its performance venues operating expenses to both reportable segments. Allocated performance venue operating expenses include the non-event related costs of operating the Company's performance venues, and include such costs as rent for the Company's leased venues, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and labor related to the overall management of the venues. Depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden and the Forum is not allocated to the reportable segments.\nPurchase Accounting Adjustments\nIn connection with the BCE, TAO Group, CLG and Obscura acquisitions in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 ( Recent Business Acquisitions\u201d), the Company recorded certain fair value adjustments related to acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations. For the Company's Recent Business Acquisitions, the Company recognized fair value adjustments primarily for (i) recognition of intangible assets such as trade names, venue management contracts, favorable leases, and festival rights, (ii) step-up of property and equipment, (iii) step-up of inventory, (iv) unfavorable lease obligation, and (v) goodwill. The aforementioned fair value adjustments, except for goodwill, will be expensed as incremental non-cash expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations based on their estimated useful lives ( Purchase Accounting Adjustments\u201d). The Company does not allocate any Purchase Accounting Adjustments to the reporting segments and reports any Purchase Accounting Adjustments as reconciliation items in reporting segment operating results. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Segment Information\u201d for more information on the presentation of Purchase Accounting Adjustments.\nInvestments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nIn July 2018, the Company acquired a 30% interest in SACO, a global provider of high-performance LED video lighting and media solutions for a total consideration of approximately $47,244. The Company is utilizing SACO as a preferred display technology provider for MSG Spheres and is benefiting from agreed upon commercial terms.\nIn addition, the Company also has other investments in various sports and entertainment companies and related technologies, accounted for either under the equity method or at fair value. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our investments in nonconsolidated affiliates.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended June 30, 2019 versus the Year Ended June 30, 2018\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,631,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,559,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>997,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>528,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (loss) in equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,878\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,220\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,671\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(727\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to The Madison Square Garden Company's stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(130,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM -

The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) higher professional fees, inclusive of costs associated with the potential Sports Distribution, and (iii) the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs not related to its third-party production business.\nIn connection with its MSG Sphere initiative, the Company expects to continue increasing its investment in personnel, content and technology. Based on the timing of these efforts, the Company expects increased expenses in Corporate and Other in fiscal year 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $3,293, or 3%, to $119,193 as compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized.\nOperating loss - Corporate and Other\nOperating loss in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $29,276, or 17%, to $199,592 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of depreciation and amortization under Corporate and Other.\nEarnings (loss) in equity method investments\nEarnings in equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2019 were $7,062 as compared to a loss of $7,770 in the prior year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to (i) the improvement in the net earnings attributable to the Company's investees as compared to the prior year, (ii) the gain on the sale of an Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC ( AMSGE\u201d) investment during the current year prior to the Company's sale of its interest in AMSGE, and (iii) a gain on the sale of the Company's interest in AMSGE during the current year. The increase was partially offset by an impairment charge recorded for the Company's investment in Tribeca Enterprises LLC ( Tribeca Enterprises\u201d) and the amortization of basis difference attributable to intangible assets for the new investments in the current year. The Company sold its interest in Tribeca Enterprises, including the outstanding loan and PIK, effective August 5, 2019. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of an impairment charge recorded for the Company's investment in Tribeca Enterprises.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $3,628, or 59%, to $9,795 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher interest income earned by the Company as a result of higher interest rate. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense incurred under the TAO Senior Credit Agreement and 2017 TAO Credit Agreement. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the TAO Senior Credit Agreement entered in May 2019.\nMiscellaneous expenses, net\nMiscellaneous expenses, net in the current year principally consist of (i) a loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, (ii) non-service components of net period pension and post retirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07, and (iii) dividend income from the Company's investment in TSQ. Miscellaneous expenses, net in the prior year principally consist of non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d) significantly changed U.S. tax law and included a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $1,348 and income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $116,872.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $1,348 differs from income tax benefits derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to pretax loss primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance of $9,421, tax expense of $8,651 relating to nondeductible officers' compensation and tax expense of $3,054 relating to noncontrolling interests. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the statutory federal rate to the effective tax rate.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company used a blended statutory federal income rate of 28% based upon the number of days that it would be taxed at the former rate of 35% and the number of days it would be taxed at the new rate of 21%, effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 of $116,872 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the blended statutory federal rate of 28% to pretax income primarily as a result of a deferred income tax benefit of $113,494 related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities under provisions contained in the new tax legislation, of which (i) $51,015 was due to the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the lower federal income tax rate of 21%, and (ii) $62,479 was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to the new rules, which provide that future federal net operating losses have an unlimited carry-forward period. These rules on future federal net operating losses allow the Company to recognize a portion of its unrecognized deferred tax assets for future deductible items. Other decreases to the statutory rate include $13,211 of income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which offsets the income tax expense attributable to most of the operating income, and $1,974 of income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $1,800 of tax expense related to state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit), (ii) $1,998 of tax expense primarily related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) $2,006 of tax expense related to consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iv) $846 of tax expense related to a change in state tax rates and (v) $223 of other.\nAdjusted operating income\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is their operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits, and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, which is referred to as adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure. In addition to excluding the impact of items discussed above, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions is also excluded in evaluating the Company's consolidated adjusted operating income (loss). The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss).\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income: Table 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase accounting adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization included purchase accounting adjustments of $17,531 and $18,134 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Other purchase accounting adjustments for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 primarily included the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $28,206, or 14%, to $169,758 as compared to the prior year.

These amounts represent the share of net loss of TAO Group, BCE, and CLG that are not attributable to the Company. In addition, the net loss attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests includes a proportional share of expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments.\nBusiness Segment Results\nMSG Entertainment\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Entertainment segment.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>819,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>780,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to adjusted operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n-----\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nThe results of operations of the MSG Entertainment segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include Obscura's results of operations associated with its third-party production business from the date of acquisition, which was November 20, 2017. The current year results include activities from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. The Company made a decision to wind down Obscura's third-party production business to focus on MSG Sphere development.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $39,204, or 5%, to $819,930 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in event-related revenues from concerts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular\n</td> <td>14,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in revenues associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings\n</td> <td>10,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues\n</td> <td>9,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in revenues from Obscura\n</td> <td>5,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in event-related revenues from other live events\n</td> <td>(16,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in BCE event-related revenues\n</td> <td>(3,255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net decreases\n</td> <td>(1,080\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in event-related revenues from concerts was primarily due to additional events and higher per event revenue during the current year, and to a lesser extent, the impact from the recognition during the current year of $1,278 of revenue associated with events that took place in prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. The increase was partially offset by the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year.\nThe increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to (i) higher ticket-related revenue mainly as a result of higher average ticket prices, (ii) an increase in paid attendance in the current year as compared to the prior year, and (iii) the recognition during the current year of $880 of revenue associated with performances that took place in prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. The Company had 210 performances of the production in fiscal year 2019, as compared to 200 performances in fiscal year 2018 due to an extension of the show's run announced in December 2018. For fiscal year 2019, more than one million tickets were sold, representing a mid-single digit percentage increase as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings was primarily due to the impact of the opening of a new venue, partially offset by (i) the impact of the current year containing 52 weeks of operations as compared to 53 weeks during the prior year, due to the timing of the retail calendar, (ii) closing of one venue, and other decreases. TAO Group's operating results are recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2019 are for the period from April 2, 2018 to March 31, 2019, as compared to TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2018, which are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018.\nThe increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues was due to increased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory and rate increases in suite licenses.\nRevenues from Obscura are included as a result of its acquisition by the Company on November 20, 2017. The current year results include revenues from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. Revenues from Obscura are principally related to its third-party production business.\nThe decrease in event-related revenues from other live events was primarily due to (i) the impact of a large-scale special event series held at The Garden and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden during the prior year, (ii) lower per-event revenue during the current year as compared to the prior year and, to a lesser extent, (iii) the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year. The decrease was slightly offset by additional events held at the Company's venues during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related revenues was primarily due to lower ticket-related revenues from the Boston Calling Music Festival.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $24,218, or 5%, to $507,091 as compared to the prior year.

Direct operating expenses from Obscura are principally related to third-party production business.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to (i) higher labor costs, (ii) higher costs associated with more performances in the current year, (iii) costs related to show enhancements, and (iv) higher marketing expenses during the current year as compared to the prior year. The Company had 210 performances of the production in fiscal year 2019, as compared to 200 performances in fiscal year 2018 due to an extension of the show's run announced in December 2018.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite licenses was primarily due to increased sales of existing sponsorship inventory.\nThe decrease in event-related direct operating expenses from other live events was primarily due to (i) the impact of a large-scale special event series held at The Garden and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden during the prior year, (ii) the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year, and (iii) to a lesser extent, lower per event expenses during the current year as compared to prior year. The decrease was slightly offset by additional events held at the Company's venues during the current year as compared to prior year.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related direct operating expenses was due to lower costs related to the Boston Calling Music Festival in the current year as compared to prior year.\nThe decrease in event-related direct operating expenses from concerts was primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year. The decrease was largely offset by additional events held at the Company's venues and higher per event expenses during the current year as compared to prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $16,576, or 9%, to $208,577 as compared to the prior year mainly due to (i) higher employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) an increase in professional fees, (iii) venue pre-opening costs associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings, and (iv) the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs related to its third-party production business for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. The increase was partially offset by the impact of certain costs being reported as direct operating expenses during the current year as compared to being reported as selling, general and administrative expenses during the prior year.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $1,245, or 1%, to $86,092 as compared to the prior year due to increases in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses largely offset by higher revenues as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $4 to $118,348 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was lower than a decrease in operating income primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nMSG Sports\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Sports segment.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>812,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,580\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to adjusted operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $34,093, or 4%, to $812,746 as compared to the prior year.

The net increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in net provisions for certain team personnel transactions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in event-related expenses associated with other live sporting events\n</td> <td>10,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other team operating expenses not discussed elsewhere in this table\n</td> <td>3,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in team personnel compensation\n</td> <td>(11,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net decreases\n</td> <td>(220\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet provisions for certain team personnel transactions and for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax were as follows:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net provisions for certain team personnel transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTeam personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2019 reflect provisions, net of recoveries recorded in the current year associated with prior year team personnel provisions, recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $46,950, (ii) player trades of $5,642, and (iii) season-ending player injuries of $542. Team personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflect provisions recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $21,559, (ii) season-ending player injuries of $4,273, which is net of insurance recoveries of $468 and (iii) player trades of $1,682.\nThe increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax reflects higher provisions for league revenue sharing expense of $1,647, partially offset by higher estimated NBA luxury tax credit of $914. Higher league revenue sharing expense primarily reflected higher estimated NHL and NBA revenue sharing expense for the 2018-19 season, partially offset by higher estimated net player escrow recoveries and, to a lesser extent, net adjustments to prior seasons' revenue sharing expense. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 season may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors. The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2018-19 and 2017-18 seasons and, therefore, received equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams.\nThe increase in event-related expenses associated with other live sporting events was due to higher per event expenses, slightly offset by fewer events during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in other team operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in league assessments and other net increases, partially offset by lower player insurance costs and lower day-of-event costs, primarily driven by the Liberty playing fewer games at The Garden during the current year as compared to the prior year. During the current year, the majority of the Liberty's home games were played at the Westchester County Center, located in White Plains, NY. Additionally, the Liberty was sold in January 2019.\nThe decrease in team personnel compensation was primarily due to roster changes at the Company's sports teams.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $11,409, or 6%, to $196,548 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits and an increase in marketing costs.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $6,580, or 5%, to $122,521 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher direct operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $5,408, or 4%, to $146,672, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was lower than the decrease in operating income primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nComparison of the Year Ended June 30, 2018 versus the Year Ended June 30, 2017\nFactors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\nTAO Group's Operating Results\nThe Company completed the TAO Group acquisition on January 31, 2017. TAO Group's financial statements are not available within the time constraints the Company requires to ensure the financial accuracy of the operating results. Therefore, the Company records TAO Group's operating results in its consolidated statements of operations under the MSG Entertainment segment on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related operating results for the year ended June 30, 2018 are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018. TAO Group's related operating results for the year ended June 30, 2017 are for the period from February 1, 2017 to March 26, 2017.\nCLG's Operating Results\nThe results of operations of the Company and the MSG Sports segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include CLG's results of operations from the date of acquisition, which was July 28, 2017. The Company's results for the year ended June 30, 2017 do not include any of CLG's operating results.\nObscura's Operating Results\nThe results of operations of the Company and the MSG Entertainment segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include Obscura's results of operations from the date of acquisition, which was November 20, 2017. The Company's results for the year ended June 30, 2017 do not include any of Obscura's operating results.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,559,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,318,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>860,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss in equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,976\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,480\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,878\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,324\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,822\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to The Madison Square Garden Company's stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM -

In addition, the direct operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 principally reflect the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Selling, general and administrative expenses - Corporate and Other\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $12,400, or 16%, to $91,840 as compared to prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits, as well as the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs not related to its third-party production business. The increase was partially offset by a management fee earned for providing management and strategic services to TAO Group (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion), which is eliminated in the Company's consolidated results of operations presented above, as well as certain favorable adjustments related to contingent payments for the Company's business acquisitions.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $15,098, or 14%, to $122,486 as compared to the prior year primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments and the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment associated with the business acquisitions (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\u201d for further discussion), partially offset by certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized.\nOperating loss - Corporate and Other\nOperating loss in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,298, or 4%, to $170,316 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of depreciation and amortization under Corporate and Other.\nLoss in equity method investments\nLoss in equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2018 improved $22,206, or 74%, to $7,770 as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $20,613 recorded during the prior year to write off the carrying value of the equity method investment in Fuse Media.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $1,480, or 19%, to $6,167 as compared to the prior year primarily due to interest expense incurred under the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for discussion. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income earned by the Company as a result of higher interest rates and a change in investment mix. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized interest income of $938, which was received in connection with the repayment of a loan receivable from one of the Company's nonconsolidated affiliates that was on a nonaccrual status.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net for the year ended June 30, 2018 principally consist of non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07. Miscellaneous income in the prior year consists principally of (i) non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07 and (ii) the recovery of certain claims in connection with a third-party bankruptcy proceeding. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, TCJA was enacted, which significantly changed the existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company was required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment even though certain key aspects of the new law became effective January 1, 2018. The Company used a blended statutory federal income tax rate of 28% based upon the number of days that it will be taxed at the former rate of 35% and the number of days it will be taxed at the new rate of 21% to calculate its most recent effective tax rate.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $116,872 and income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $4,404.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 of $116,872 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the blended statutory federal rate of 28% to pretax income primarily as a result of a deferred income tax benefit of $113,494 related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities under provisions contained in the new tax legislation, of which (i) $51,015 was due to the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the lower federal income tax rate of 21%, and (ii) $62,479 was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to the new rules, which provide that future federal net operating losses have an unlimited carry-forward period. These rules on future federal net operating losses allow the Company to recognize a portion of its unrecognized deferred tax assets for future deductible items. Other decreases to the statutory rate include $13,211 of income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which offsets the income tax expense attributable to most of the operating income, and $1,974 of income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $1,800 of tax expense related to state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit), (ii) $1,998 of tax expense primarily related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) $2,006 of tax expense related to consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iv) $846 of tax expense related to a change in state tax rates and (v) $223 of other.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $4,404 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 35% to pretax income primarily as a result of (i) an increase of $30,697 in recorded federal and state valuation allowances, (ii) tax expense of $3,449 related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) the tax impact of consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests of $1,414, (iv) deferred expense of $1,329 based on tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles that are not available as a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets, and (v) expense of $672 recorded due to a state rate change computed as a result of filed state tax returns. This tax expense is offset by (i) $6,716 of state tax benefit (net of federal effect), (ii) $6,477 of tax benefit related to other comprehensive income gains recorded in continuing operations and (iii) $354 of other.\nAdjusted operating income\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase accounting adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization included purchase accounting adjustments of $18,134 and $3,152 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Other purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily included the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.

These increases were offset by certain favorable adjustments related to contingent payments for the Company's business acquisitions.\nNet income (loss) attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $628 and a net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of $6,518 as compared to $4,370 of net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and $304 of net income attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended June 30, 2017.

These decreases were partially offset by other net increases, inclusive of league distributions related to CLG, which was acquired on July 28, 2017.\nThe decrease in event-related revenues from other live sporting events was due to a change in the mix of events held during the fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year and one event that generated lower revenue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues and ad sales commissions was primarily due to sales of new sponsorship and signage inventory, increased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory and the impact of a marketing partner, upon renewal of its agreement, shifting its marketing partnership spend from a combination of entertainment and sports entirely to sports.\nThe increase in local media rights fees from MSG Networks was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' pre/regular season ticket-related revenues was primarily due to higher average Rangers per-game revenue, partially offset by lower average Liberty and Knicks per-game revenue.\nThe increase in suite rental fee revenue was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $16,063, or 3%, to $456,932 as compared to the prior year.

Lower NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense primarily reflects an increase in estimated net player escrow recoveries, partially offset by higher estimated NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense for the 2017-18 season and, to a lesser extent, net adjustments to prior season's revenue sharing expense. The increase in estimated NBA luxury tax receipt is based on the Knicks' roster, which as of June 30, 2018 did not result in luxury tax for the 2017-18 season. The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2016-17 season and, therefore, received an equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams. The actual amounts for the 2017-18 season may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors.\nTeam personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflect provisions recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $21,559, (ii) season-ending player injuries of $4,273, which is net of insurance recoveries of $468 and (iii) player trades of $1,682. Team personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2017 reflect provisions recorded for waivers/contract terminations and player trades of $13,979 and $8,000, respectively.\nThe increase in other team operating expenses was primarily due to higher day-of-event costs and league expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $22,820, or 11%, to $185,139 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower employee compensation and related benefits, and to a lesser extent, lower marketing costs, partially offset by an increase in corporate general and administrative costs. The reduction in employee compensation and related benefits as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by severance-related costs in the prior year, which were attributable to a separation agreement with a team executive.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $1,838, or 20%, to $7,481 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an intangible asset becoming fully amortized.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,390, or 6%, to $129,101 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $6,502, or 4%, to $152,080, as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expense, and direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our businesses and maximum borrowing capacity under our $390,000 revolving credit facilities. Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related items, capital spending (including our planned construction of large-scale venues in Las Vegas and London), investments and related loans that we may fund from time to time, repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, repayment of debt, and the payment of earn-out obligations and mandatory purchases from prior acquisitions. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, challenging U.S. and global economic conditions could adversely impact its ability to do so at that time.\nWe regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. Without regard to the impact of the potential Sports Distribution, which would have a positive impact on the Company's liquidity, if and when it is completed, we believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately $1,086,000 in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $108,000 of short-term investments as of June 30, 2019, along with available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities combined with operating cash flows, over the next 12 months, to fund our operations, to pursue the development of the new venues discussed below and other new business opportunities and to repurchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (see Note 2 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's short-term investments).\nTAO Group's principal uses of cash include working capital related-items, investments in new venues, tax-related cash distributions, interest expense payments and repayment of debt. TAO Group plans to continue to grow its business through the opening of new venues. TAO Group regularly monitors and assesses its ability to meet its funding and investment requirements. Over the next 12 months, the Company believes that TAO Group has sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, cash generated from operations and its revolving credit facility to fund its operations, service debt obligations and pursue new business opportunities.\nMSG Spheres\nThe Company has made significant progress on MSG Sphere at The Venetian, its state-of-the-art entertainment venue currently under construction in Las Vegas.\nWe view both innovative design and cost management as key imperatives to the construction process. While it is always difficult to provide a definitive construction cost estimate for large-scale construction projects, it is particularly challenging for one as unique as MSG Sphere. In May, our Board of Directors approved a preliminary cost estimate of $1,200,000 based upon schematic designs for purposes of developing the Company's budget and financial projections. We expect the estimation process for MSG Sphere construction costs will be dynamic as the project moves forward. The actual construction costs for MSG Sphere in Las Vegas incurred through June 30, 2019 were approximately $109,000.\nIn June, the Company announced that it engaged AECOM - a leading builder known for creating bold, innovative projects - as its general contractor for the Las Vegas project. We made the strategic decision to enter into a cost plus\u201d construction contract with AECOM. While this type of contract adds to the complexity of the cost estimation process, we believe our cost plus\u201d construction contract with AECOM will help our efforts to maximize the quality of the work, while permitting us to play a more vigilant role in managing the project's costs, including full transparency into the selection of, negotiations with, and labor and materials utilized by subcontractors.\nIn order to further drive cost control, under the terms of the construction contract, AECOM will receive lower fees if the hard\u201d construction costs come in greater than an incentive benchmark\u201d agreed upon by the Company and AECOM. The process of setting the incentive benchmark began in July when AECOM provided the Company with its proposal, representing its estimate of the hard construction costs of the project. AECOM's initial benchmark proposal, together with the costs of additional core technology and estimated soft costs, results in a project cost estimate that is approximately $1,700,000. We believe this cost estimate is too high and are now in the contractual process of reviewing, testing and challenging the elements of AECOM's estimates and assumptions. We are also value engineering aspects of the project to further reduce costs. We intend to do this in a granular fashion using, among other resources, our outside project manager. We believe we will be successful in achieving significant cost reductions through this process, while noting that there are no assurances that we will reach an agreement on the incentive benchmark.\nThe above cost estimates for the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas have been reduced to reflect the $75,000 that the Las Vegas Sands Corp. has agreed to pay the Company to defray the construction costs of a pedestrian bridge that will link the venue to the Sands Expo Convention Center. The estimates and costs also do not contain significant capitalized and non-capitalized costs for items\nsuch as content creation, internal labor costs, and furniture and equipment. As with any major construction project, the construction of MSG Spheres is subject to potential unexpected delays, costs or other complications. Our goal is to open MSG Sphere in Las Vegas in calendar year 2021.\nSee Exhibit 10.65 to this Form 10-K for a copy of the Construction Agreement, dated May 13, 2019, by and between MSG Las Vegas, LLC and Hunt Construction Group Inc. (AECOM).\nIn February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to the Company's second MSG Sphere and first large-scale international venue. Cost estimates for MSG Sphere in London are still in development as the Company continues to refine its design, which it currently expects will be substantially similar to MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, including having approximately the same seating capacity. The Company submitted a planning application to the local planning authority in March 2019 and expects a planning determination by the end of calendar year 2019 (which may become the subject of further discussions with the planning authority). Our plan is to begin construction on the MSG Sphere venue in London only once we have received all necessary approvals and have further advanced our design for the venue.\nWe anticipate that MSG Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial incremental revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis. For additional information regarding the Company's capital expenditures related to the MSG Spheres, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn connection with these efforts, the Company will need to pursue additional capital beyond that which is available from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital.\nThe potential Sports Distribution, if consummated, will provide the Company with additional liquidity, some or all of which could be used to finance part of the cost of constructing the MSG Spheres. The current plan for the Sports Distribution contemplates that the Company would retain up to about one-third of the common stock of Sports Spinco. Some or all of that interest could be sold for cash by the Company.\nWe will continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where we believe next-generation venues such as the MSG Sphere can be successful.\nFinancing Agreements, Revolving Credit Facilities Provided to Nonconsolidated Affiliates and Stock Repurchases\nFinancing Agreements\nOn September 30, 2016, New York Knicks, LLC ( Knicks LLC\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $200,000 with a term of five years (the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed may be distributed to the Company except during an event of default. There was no borrowing under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, Knicks LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenant.\nOn September 30, 2016, Knicks LLC entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a lender for an initial maximum credit amount of $15,000 and a 364-day term (the Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility\u201d). Knicks LLC renewed this facility with the lender on the same terms in successive years and the facility has been renewed for a new term effective as of September 27, 2019. There was no borrowing under the Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019. This facility does not have financial covenants.\nOn January 25, 2017, New York Rangers, LLC ( Rangers LLC\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $150,000 with a term of five years (the Rangers Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed may be distributed to the Company except during an event of default. There was no borrowing under the Rangers Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, Rangers LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenant.\nOn May 23, 2019, TAO Group Intermediate Holdings LLC ( TAOIH\u201d) and TAO Group Operating LLC ( TAOG\u201d), entered into a credit agreement (the TAO Senior Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and the lenders party thereto. The TAO Senior Credit Agreement provides TAOG with senior secured credit facilities (the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) consisting of: (i) an initial $40,000 term loan facility with a term of five years and (ii) a $25,000 revolving credit facility with a term of five years (the TAO Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities were obtained without recourse to the Company or any of its affiliates (other than TAOG, TAOIH and its subsidiaries). The outstanding amount drawn\non the TAO Revolving Credit Facility was $15,000 as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, TAOIH was in compliance with the required financial covenants.\nOn May 23, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of TAO Group Holdings LLC entered into an intercompany subordinated term loan credit agreement providing for a credit facility of $49,000 that matures in August 2024 (the TAO Subordinated Credit Facility\u201d). The balances and interest-related activities pertaining to the TAO Subordinated Credit Agreement have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. As of June 30, 2019, TAO Group Holdings LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenants.\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility, Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility, Rangers Revolving Credit Facility and the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facilities Provided to Nonconsolidated Affiliates, Financing Agreements and Stock Repurchases\nSee Note 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of the Company's revolving credit facility extended to a nonconsolidated affiliate and the Company's stock repurchases, respectively.\nBilateral Letters of Credit Lines\nThe Company has established bilateral credit lines with a bank to issue letters of credit in support of the Company's business operations. The Company pays fees for the letters of credit that are credited against interest income the Company receives in return from its investments in notes receivable with the same bank. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $12,512 of letters of credit outstanding pursuant to which fees were credited against note investments. Of which, TAO Group had two letters of credit outstanding for $750 as of March 31, 2019.\nCash Flow Discussion\nAs of June 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $1,117,901, as compared to $1,256,620 as of June 30, 2018. The following table summarizes the Company's cash flow activities for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(182,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(264,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,746\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158,525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(138,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(199,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $56,376 to $161,253 as compared to the prior year primarily due to changes in certain assets and liabilities, as well as a decrease in net income to a net loss in the current year adjusted for non-cash items. The changes in certain assets and liabilities are driven by decreases in collections due to promoters and prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by higher accrued and other liabilities, all due to timing. The decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items was impacted by earnings in equity method investments in the current year as compared to a loss in the prior year and lower depreciation and amortization in the current year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $5,903 to $217,629 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items including (i) a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effective January 1, 2018, (ii) a write-off of deferred production costs associated with the New York Spectacular in the prior year, and (iii) an impairment charge to write off the carrying value of the Company's equity investment in Fuse Media in the prior year, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year. This increase was offset by a severance-related payment in fiscal year 2018 attributable to a separation agreement with a team executive which was accrued for as of June 30, 2017 and a decrease in cash received related to deferred revenue primarily due to timing.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased by $50,538 to $232,895 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the Company's investment in a British pound-denominated time deposit and an investment in SACO, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of the Company's 50% interest in AMSGE.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $81,944 to $182,357 as compared to the prior year primarily due to (i) a net decrease in business acquisitions, (ii) repayments received from loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, and (iii) the acquisition of available-for-sale securities in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by (i) higher capital expenditures in fiscal year 2018, primarily associated with the purchase of land in London and costs incurred in developing the Company's new venues in Las Vegas and London, (ii) new investments made in nonconsolidated affiliates, and (iii) a franchise fee payment made in fiscal year 2018 associated with CLG's membership in the League of Legends\u201d North American League Championship Series.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased by $20,649 to $71,746 as compared to the prior year due to the repayment of all obligations under the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement partially offset by (i) proceeds received from borrowings under the TAO Senior Credit Agreement, (ii) lower taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation in the current year as compared to the prior year, (iii repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the prior year as compared to no repurchases in the current year, and other financing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $107,428 to $51,097 as compared to the prior year largely due to lower repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the current year as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by (i) higher taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year, (ii) distributions to noncontrolling interest holders related to the acquisition of TAO Group in fiscal year 2018 and (iii) a contingent consideration payment related to the acquisition of CLG in fiscal year 2018.\nContractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFuture cash payments required under contracts entered into by the Company in the normal course of business and outstanding letters of credit as of June 30, 2019 are summarized in the following table: Table 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off balance sheet arrangements: (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>377,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit (d)\n</td> <td>12,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>646,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations reflected on the balance sheet (e)\n</td> <td>117,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (f)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Off balance sheet arrangements disclosed in the table above do not include MSG Sphere related commitments that are not reflected on the balance sheet of $1,049,781.

See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the amount reflected on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. In addition, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the principal repayments required under the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the TAO Revolving Credit Facility.\nMSG and a subsidiary of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. entered into a 50-year ground lease in Las Vegas pursuant to which MSG has agreed to construct a large-scale venue. MSG has announced plans to construct an MSG Sphere on that site. See Item 1. Business - Our Business - Our Performance Venues - MSG Sphere.\u201d\nMSG has the right to increase its equity interest in TAO Group through a call right on the equity of the other TAO Group equityholders after the fifth anniversary of the closing date (January 31, 2022) and prior to such date in certain events. The other TAO Group equityholders have the right to put to TAO Group their equity interests in TAO Group after the fifth anniversary of the closing and, in certain circumstances to put to MSG prior to the fifth anniversary. The put and call prices are at fair market value (or in certain circumstances, subject to a discount). Consideration paid upon the exercise of any such put or call right shall be, at MSG's option, in cash, debt, or MSG Class A Common Stock, subject to certain limitations.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nThe dependence of the MSG Sports segment on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company's fiscal year. The dependence of the MSG Entertainment segment on revenues from the Christmas Spectacular generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income in the second quarter of the Company's fiscal year. In addition, while it does not have a material impact on seasonality of our business, the first and third calendar quarters are seasonally lighter quarters for TAO Group as compared to its second and fourth calendar quarters. As the Company consolidates TAO Group results of operations on a three-month lag basis, the seasonally lighter quarters for TAO will be reflected in the second and fourth quarters of the Company's fiscal year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Management believes its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the Company's arrangements with multiple performance obligations, primarily multi-year sponsorship agreements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets\nThe Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets accounted for approximately 58% of the Company's consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2019 and consisted of the following:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indefinite-lived intangible assets\n</td> <td>176,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortizable intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization\n</td> <td>220,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment, net\n</td> <td>1,380,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,170,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn assessing the recoverability of the Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, the Company must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve significant uncertainties and judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its long-lived and/or indefinite-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. The Company has two operating and reportable segments, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business.\nFor purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company has three reporting units across its two operating segments, which are MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and TAO Group. TAO Group was acquired after the annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2017 and represents a separate reporting unit within the MSG Entertainment segment for goodwill impairment testing.\nThe goodwill balance reported on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 by reporting unit was as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Sports\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Entertainment\n</td> <td>76,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TAO Group\n</td> <td>88,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company's reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.\nThe Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for all of the Company's reporting units for the fiscal year 2019 impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>macroeconomic conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>industry and market considerations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cost factors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>overall financial performance of the reporting unit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and there was no impairment of goodwill identified for any of its reporting units. Based on these impairment tests, the Company's MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and TAO Group reporting units had sufficient safety margins, defined as the excess of the amount by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value of each reporting unit (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). For MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment the most recent quantitative assessments were used in making this determination and due to the proximity of the acquisition date for TAO Group to the goodwill impairment test date, the initial purchase price was assumed to be the fair value of the TAO Group reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test. The Company believes that if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nIdentifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 by reportable segment:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sports franchises (MSG Sports segment)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trademarks (MSG Entertainment segment)\n</td> <td>62,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Photographic related rights (MSG Sports segment)\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets in the MSG Sports segment and the majority of the trademarks in the MSG Entertainment segment. These assessments considered the events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. Examples of such events and circumstances include:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cost factors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>financial performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>industry and market considerations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>macroeconomic conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and there were no impairments identified. Based on these impairment tests, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of each identifiable indefinite-lived intangible asset's estimated fair value over its respective carrying value. The Company believes that if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nFor other long-lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.\nThe estimated useful lives and net carrying values of the Company's intangible assets subject to amortization as of June 30, 2019 are as follows: Table 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nUseful Lives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>25 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venue management contracts\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>25 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable lease assets\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>16 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Season ticket holder relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-compete agreements\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>5.75 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Festival rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other intangibles\n</td> <td>3 months\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has recognized intangible assets for trade names, venue management contracts, favorable lease assets, season ticket holder relationships, non-compete agreements, festival rights and other intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The Company has determined that these intangible assets have finite lives.\nThe useful lives of the Company's long-lived assets are based on estimates of the period over which the Company expects the assets to be of economic benefit to the Company. In estimating the useful lives, the Company considers factors such as, but not limited to, risk of obsolescence, anticipated use, plans of the Company, and applicable laws and permit requirements. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that its estimated useful lives are appropriate.\nContingent Consideration\nSome of the Company's acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating targets.\nThe fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, the Company estimates the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration that the Company will pay to the former owners as a liability in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company measures its contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy, which can result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the fair value of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of TAO Group and CLG.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan\nThe Company utilizes actuarial methods to calculate pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related net periodic benefit cost which are based on actuarial assumptions. Key assumptions, the discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are important elements of the plans' expense and liability measurement and we evaluate these key assumptions annually. Other assumptions include demographic factors, such as mortality, retirement age and turnover. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to various factors, including, but not limited to, changing economic and market conditions. Differences between actual and expected occurrences could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation recorded by the Company. Material changes in the costs of the plans may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of the plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in asset levels and changes in legislation. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best estimate regarding future expectations.\nAccumulated and projected benefit obligations reflect the present value of future cash payments for benefits. We use the Willis Towers Watson U.S. Rate Link: 40-90 Discount Rate Model (which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds) to discount these benefit payments on a plan by plan basis, to select a rate at which we believe each plan's benefits could be effectively settled. Additionally, the Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows ( Spot Rate Approach\u201d). The Company believes the Spot Rate Approach provides a more accurate measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.\nLower discount rates increase the present value of benefit obligations and will usually increase the subsequent year's net periodic benefit cost. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations as of June 30, 2019 for the Company's Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan were 3.58% and 3.18%, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in each of these assumed discount rates would increase the projected benefit obligations for the Company's Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan at June 30, 2019 by $5,950 and $80, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.25%, 3.90% and 4.19%, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the Company's Pension Plans. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.25%, 3.67% and 4.06%, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the Company's Postretirement Plan. A 25 basis point decrease in these assumed discount rates would increase the total net periodic benefit cost for the Company's Pension Plans by $100 and decrease net periodic benefit cost for Postretirement Plan by $6 for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plans' asset allocation structures over a long-term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling, and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward-looking economic outlook, and economic/financial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return was selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (a) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b) projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Company's funded pension plans was 3.72% for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company's funded plans. Adverse market performance in the future could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the Company which could increase the Company's funding requirements related to these plans, as well as negatively affect the Company's operating results by increasing the net periodic benefit cost. A 25 basis point decrease in the long-term return on pension plan assets assumption would increase net periodic pension benefit cost by $300 for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nAnother important assumption for our Postretirement Plan is healthcare cost trend rates. We developed our estimate of the healthcare cost trend rates through examination of the Company's claims experience and the results of recent healthcare trend surveys.\nAssumptions for healthcare cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligation for our Postretirement Plan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic\nBenefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Benefit\nObligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year\n</td> <td>7.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.75%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\n</td> <td>2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2027\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and benefit obligation for our postretirement plan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019: Table 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) on\nTotal of Service\nand Interest Cost\nComponents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) on\nBenefit Obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One percentage point increase\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One percentage point decrease\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGAAP includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in the Company's earnings that otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur. For example, while the expected long-term rate of return on the plans' assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year. These differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses, which are then amortized over time.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

This section provides a general description of our business, as well as other matters that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition and in anticipating future trends.\nResults of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our segments are MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides a discussion of our financial condition, as well as an analysis of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes summaries of (i) our primary sources of liquidity and (ii) our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements that existed at June 30, 2019.\nSeasonality of Our Business. This section discusses the seasonal performance of our MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment segments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies. This section includes a discussion of accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a sports and entertainment business comprised of dynamic and powerful assets and brands. The Company is comprised of two business segments: MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, which is built on a foundation of iconic venues and compelling content, including live sports and entertainment events that we create, produce and present. The Company conducts\na significant portion of its operations at venues that it either owns or operates under long-term leases. The Company owns Madison Square Garden ( The Garden\u201d) and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre in Chicago. In addition, the Company leases Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\nDescription of Our Segments\nMSG Entertainment\nOur MSG Entertainment segment, which represented approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019, is one of the country's leaders in live entertainment. MSG Entertainment produces, presents and hosts live entertainment events, including (i) concerts and (ii) other live events such as family shows, performing arts events and special events, in our diverse collection of venues. Those venues include The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum, and The Chicago Theatre. The scope of our collection of venues enables us to showcase acts that cover a wide spectrum of genres and popular appeal.\nAlthough we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows in which case we have economic risk relating to the event.\nMSG Entertainment also creates, produces and/or presents live productions that are performed in the Company's venues. This includes the Christmas Spectacular, which is the top grossing live holiday family show in North America, featuring the Rockettes. The Christmas Spectacular has been performed at Radio City Music Hall for 86 years and more than one million tickets were sold for performances during the 2018 holiday season.\nIn July 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. This was followed in January 2017 by the Company's purchase of a controlling interest in TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands. These companies are part of the MSG Entertainment segment. In November 2017, the Company acquired a 100% controlling interest in Obscura, a creative studio, recognized for its work in designing and developing next-generation immersive experiences. Revenues generated by Obscura's third-party production business (and related costs) are reflected in the MSG Entertainment segment. The Company has decided to wind down this third-party productions business to focus on MSG Sphere development. Any costs incurred by Obscura that are associated with MSG Sphere development that are not capitalized are reported in Corporate and Other\u201d.\nRevenue Sources\nOur primary sources of revenue in our MSG Entertainment segment are ticket sales to our audiences for live events that we produce or promote/co-promote and license fees for our venues paid by third-party promoters in connection with events that we do not produce or promote/co-promote. We also generate revenue from other sources, including facility and ticketing fees, concessions, sponsorships and signage, a portion of suite license fees at The Garden, merchandising and tours at certain of our venues. The amount of revenue and expense we record in our MSG Entertainment segment for a given event depends to a significant extent on whether we are promoting or co-promoting the event or are licensing our venue to a third party. In addition, a significant component of the MSG Entertainment segment revenues are generated by the TAO Group through entertainment dining and nightlife offerings, which primarily consist of food and beverage sales and venue management fees.\nTicket Sales and Suite Licenses\nFor our productions and for entertainment events in our venues that we promote, we recognize revenues from the sale of tickets to our audiences. We sell tickets to the public through our box office, via our web sites and ticketing agencies and through group sales. The amount of revenue we earn from ticket sales depends on the number of shows and the mix of events that we promote, the capacity of the venue used, the extent to which we can sell to fully utilize the capacity and our ticket prices. During the fiscal year 2017, we implemented significant changes to how we sell Christmas Spectacular tickets. By eliminating block sales to third party brokers, we brought a significant number of tickets back in-house, which created the opportunity for more customers to buy tickets to the production directly from us.\nThe Garden has 21 Event Level suites, 58 Lexus Madison Level suites, and 18 Signature Level suites. Suite licenses at The Garden are generally sold to corporate customers pursuant to multi-year licenses. Under standard suite licenses, the licensees pay an annual license fee, which varies depending on the location of the suite. The license fee includes, for each seat in the suite, tickets for events at The Garden for which tickets are sold to the general public, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, suite holders separately pay for food and beverage service in their suites at The Garden. Revenues from the sale of suite licenses are shared between our MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments.\nVenue License Fees\nFor entertainment events held at our venues that we do not produce, promote or co-promote, we typically earn revenue from venue license fees charged to the third-party promoter of the event. The amount of license fees we charge varies by venue, as well as by the size of the production and the number of days utilized, among other factors. Our fees typically include both the cost of renting space in our venues and costs for providing event staff, such as front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including stagehands, electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers and security as well as production services such as staging, lighting and sound.\nFacility and Ticketing Fees\nFor all public and ticketed entertainment events held in our venues, we also earn additional revenues on substantially all tickets sold, whether we promote/co-promote the event or license the venue to a third party. These revenues are earned in the form of certain fees and assessments, including the facility fee we charge, and vary by venue.\nConcessions\nWe sell food and beverages during substantially all entertainment events held at our venues. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of our concession revenues, we also generate revenue from catering for our suites at The Garden.\nMerchandise\nWe earn revenues from the sale of merchandise relating to our proprietary productions and other live entertainment events that take place at our venues. The majority of our merchandise revenues are generated through on-site sales during performances of our productions and other live events. We also generate revenues from the sales of our Christmas Spectacular merchandise, such as ornaments and apparel, through traditional retail channels. Typically, revenues from our merchandise sales at our non-proprietary events relate to sales of merchandise provided by the artist, the producer or promoter of the event and are generally subject to a revenue sharing arrangement.\nVenue Signage and Sponsorship\nWe earn revenues through the sale of signage space and sponsorship rights in connection with our venues, productions and other live entertainment events. Signage revenues generally involve the sale of advertising space at The Garden during entertainment events and otherwise in our venues.\nSponsorship rights may require us to use the name, logos and other trademarks of sponsors in our advertising and in promotions for our venues, productions and other live entertainment events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our productions, events and venues in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in our venues or in the community.\nEntertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings\nWe earn revenues from entertainment dining and nightlife offerings through our operations of the TAO Group's restaurants and nightlife and hospitality venues. These revenues primarily consist of food and beverage sales and banquet hosting services at TAO Group leased restaurants and nightclubs. In addition, we earn fees from our real estate partners for operating certain of our restaurants and nightclubs.\nExpenses\nOur MSG Entertainment segment's principal expenses are payments made to performers of our productions, staging costs and day-of-event costs associated with events, and advertising costs. We charge a portion of our actual expenses associated with the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of our venues, along with a portion of our corporate expenses, to our MSG Entertainment segment. However, the operating results of our MSG Entertainment segment benefit from the fact that no rent is charged to the segment for use of the Company's owned venues. We do not allocate to our segments depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden or the Forum.\nPerformer Payments\nOur productions are performed by talented actors, dancers, singers, musicians and entertainers. In order to attract and retain this talent, we are required to pay our performers an amount that is commensurate with both their abilities and the demand for their services from other entertainment companies. Our productions typically feature ensemble casts (such as the Rockettes), where most of our performers are paid based on a standard scale,\u201d pursuant to CBAs we negotiate with the performers' unions. Certain performers, however, have individually negotiated contracts.\nStaging Costs\nStaging costs for our proprietary events as well as other events that we promote include the costs of sets, lighting, display technologies, special effects, sound and all of the other technical aspects involved in presenting a live entertainment event. These costs vary substantially depending on the nature of the particular show, but tend to be highest for large-scale theatrical productions, such as the Christmas Spectacular. For concerts we promote, the performer usually provides a fully-produced show. Along with performer salaries, the staging costs associated with a given production are an important factor in the determination of ticket prices.\nDay-of-Event Costs\nFor days on which MSG Entertainment stages its productions, promotes an event or provides one of our venues to a third-party promoter under a license fee arrangement, the event is charged the variable costs associated with such event, including box office staff, stagehands, ticket takers, ushers, security, and other similar expenses. In situations where we provide our venues to a third-party promoter under a license fee arrangement, day-of-event costs are typically included in the license fees charged to the promoter.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nWe incur significant costs promoting our productions and other events through various advertising campaigns, including advertising on outdoor platforms and in newspapers, on television and radio, and on social and digital platforms. In light of the intense competition for entertainment events, such expenditures are a necessity to drive interest in our productions and encourage members of the public to purchase tickets to our shows.\nEntertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings Costs\nThrough our ownership in the operations of the TAO Group restaurants and nightlife and hospitality venues, we incur costs for providing food and beverage as well as banquet hosting services to our customers. Our dining and nightlife offering costs primarily include the following:\n \u2022 labor costs, consisting of restaurant management salaries, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related items, including taxes and fringe benefits; \n \u2022 food and beverage costs; \n \u2022 operating costs, consisting of maintenance, utilities, bank and credit card charges, and any other restaurant-level expenses; and \n \u2022 occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, insurance premiums and taxes.  Factors Affecting Operating Results\nThe operating results of our MSG Entertainment segment are largely dependent on our ability to attract concerts and other live events to our venues, as well as the continuing popularity of the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall. Our MSG Entertainment segment recognized an operating loss during the year ended June 30, 2017, which includes a $33,629 write-off of deferred production costs related to the New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes ( New York Spectacular\u201d).\nOur MSG Entertainment segment's future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of these conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower demand for our entertainment and nightlife offerings, suite licenses and tickets to our live productions, concerts, family shows and other events, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, as well as lower levels of sponsorship and venue signage. These conditions may also affect the number of concerts, family shows and other events that take place in the future. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to explore additional opportunities to expand our presence in the entertainment industry. Any new investment may not initially contribute to operating income, but is intended to become operationally profitable over time. Our results will also be affected by investments in, and the success of, new productions.\nMSG Sports\nOur MSG Sports segment, which represented approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019, owns and operates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (the Knicks\u201d), a founding member of the NBA, and the New York Rangers (the Rangers\u201d), one of the original six\u201d franchises of the NHL. MSG Sports also owns and operates the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (the AHL\u201d), which is the primary player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Company owns and operates an NBA G League\nteam, named the Westchester Knicks, which plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY. The Knicks and Rangers play their home games at The Garden. In January 2019, the Company sold the New York Liberty (the Liberty\u201d) of the Women's National Basketball Association (the WNBA\u201d). For all periods through the sale date, MSG Sports includes the Liberty. Our professional sports franchises are collectively referred to herein as our sports teams.\u201d The MSG Sports segment also includes CLG, a premier North American esports organization, and Knicks Gaming, MSG's franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League. CLG and Knicks Gaming are collectively referred to herein as our esports teams,\u201d and, together with our sports teams, our teams.\u201d In addition, our sports business also promotes, produces and/or presents a broad array of live sporting events including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, and college wrestling.\nRevenue Sources\nWe earn revenue in our MSG Sports segment from several primary sources: ticket sales and a portion of suite rental fees at The Garden, our share of distributions from NHL and NBA league-wide national and international television contracts and other league-wide revenue sources, venue signage and other sponsorships, concessions and merchandising. Our MSG Sports segment also earns substantial fees from MSG Networks for the local media rights to telecast the games of our professional sports teams. We also earn venue license fees, primarily from the rental of The Garden to third-party promoters or conferences holding sporting events at our arena. The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our sports teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our sports teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenue derives from rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our sports teams and our ability to attract other compelling sports content.\nTicket Sales, Suite Licenses, Venue Licenses, Facility and Ticketing Fees\nTicket sales have historically constituted the largest single source of revenue for our MSG Sports segment. We sell tickets to our sports teams' home games through season tickets, which are typically held by long-term season subscribers, through group sales, and through single-game tickets, which are purchased by fans either individually or in multi-game packages. The prices of our tickets vary, depending on the sports team and the location of the seats. We generally review and set the price of our tickets before the start of each team's season. During the fiscal year 2017 we made changes to our ticketing polices, resulting in fewer full season tickets sold and more sales of individual and group tickets, as well as partial season plans.\nRevenues from the sale of suite licenses are shared between the MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments. See - MSG Entertainment - Revenue Sources\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition to our sports teams' home games, we also present or host other live sporting events at our venues. When the Company acts as the promoter or co-promoter of such events, the Company typically earns revenues from ticket sales and incurs expenses associated with the event. When these events are promoted by third-party promoters, the Company typically earns venue license fees from the promoter for use of our venues. When licensing our venues, the amount recorded as revenue also includes the event's variable costs such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staffs, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security and building services, which we pass along to the promoter. The number and mix of live sporting events, including whether we are the promoter or co-promoter of an event or license our venues to a third-party promoter, could have a significant impact on the level of revenues and expenses that we record in our MSG Sports segment.\nOur MSG Sports segment also earns revenues in the form of certain fees added to ticket prices for events held at our venues, regardless of whether we act as promoter or co-promoter for such events. This currently includes a facility fee the Company charges on tickets it sells to all events at our venues, except for our sports teams' season tickets and certain other limited exceptions.\nMedia Rights\nWe earn revenue from the licensing of media rights for our sports teams' home and away games and also through the receipt of our share of fees paid for league-wide media rights, which are awarded under contracts negotiated and administered by each league.\nThe Company and MSG Networks are parties to media rights agreements covering the local telecast rights for the Knicks and Rangers. The financial success of our MSG Sports segment is significantly dependent on the rights fees we receive from MSG Networks in connection with the telecast of our Knicks and Rangers games.\nNational and international telecast arrangements differ by league. Fees paid by telecasters under these arrangements are pooled by each league and then generally shared equally among all teams.\nVenue Signage and Sponsorships and Ad Sales Commission\nWe earn revenues through the sale of signage space at The Garden and sponsorship rights in connection with our teams and certain other sporting events. Our strategy is to develop marketing partnerships with world-class brands by creating customized platforms that achieve our partners' business objectives. Signage sales generally involve the sale of advertising space within The Garden during our sports teams' home games and include the sale of signage on the ice and on the boards of the hockey rink during Rangers games, courtside during Knicks games, and/or on the various scoreboards and display panels at The Garden. We offer both television camera-visible and non-camera-visible signage space.\nSponsorship rights generally require us to use the name, logos and other trademarks of a sponsor in our advertising and in promotions for our teams and during our sports events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our teams and venues in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in The Garden or in the community.\nThe Company and MSG Networks are parties to an advertising sales representation agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we have the exclusive right and obligation to sell advertising availabilities of MSG Networks. We are entitled to and earn commission revenue on such sales. The expense associated with advertising personnel, which was transferred from MSG Networks in connection with this advertising sales representation agreement, is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nConcessions\nWe sell food and beverages during all sporting events held at our venues. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of our concession revenues, we also provide higher-end dining at our full service restaurant and clubs as well as catering for suites at The Garden.\nMerchandise\nWe earn revenues from the sale of our teams' merchandise both through the in-venue (and in some cases, online) sale of items bearing the logos or other marks of our teams and through our share of sports league distributions of royalties and other revenues from the sports leagues' licensing of team and sports league trademarks, which revenues are generally shared equally among the teams in the sports leagues. By agreement among the teams, each of the sports leagues in which we operate acts as an agent for the sports teams to license their logos and other marks, as well as the marks of the leagues, subject to certain rights retained by the teams to license these marks within their arenas and the geographic areas in which they operate.\nExpenses\nThe most significant expenses in our MSG Sports segment are player and other team personnel salaries and charges for transactions relating to players for career-ending and season-ending injuries, trades, and waivers and contract termination costs of players and other team personnel, including team executives. We also incur costs for travel, player insurance, league operating assessments (including a 6% NBA assessment on regular season ticket sales), NHL and NBA revenue sharing and NBA luxury tax. We charge a portion of our actual expenses associated with the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of our venues, along with a portion of our corporate expenses, to our MSG Sports segment. However, the operating results of our MSG Sports segment benefit from the fact that no rent is charged to the segment for use of the Company's owned venues. We do not allocate to our segments depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden or the Forum.\nPlayer Salaries, Escrow System/Revenue Sharing and NBA Luxury Tax\nThe amount we pay an individual player is typically determined by negotiation between the player (typically represented by an agent) and us, and is generally influenced by the player's past performance, the amounts paid to players with comparable past performance by other sports teams and restrictions in the CBAs, including the salary floors and caps and NBA luxury tax. The leagues' CBAs typically contain restrictions on when players may move between league clubs following expiration of their contracts and what rights their current and former clubs have.\nNBA CBA. The NBA CBA expires after the 2023-24 season (although the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association ( NBPA\u201d) each have the right to terminate the CBA following the 2022-23 season). The NBA CBA contains a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team's aggregate player salaries with a requirement that the team pay any deficiency to the players on its roster) and a soft\u201d salary cap (i.e., a cap on each team's aggregate player salaries but with certain exceptions that enable teams to pay players more, sometimes substantially more, than the cap).\nNBA Luxury Tax. Amounts in this paragraph are in thousands, except for luxury tax rates. The NBA CBA provides for a luxury tax that is applicable to all teams with aggregate player salaries exceeding a threshold that is set prior to each season based upon projected league-wide revenues (as defined under the CBA). The luxury tax rates for teams with aggregate player salaries above such threshold start at $1.50 for each $1.00 of team salary above the threshold up to $5,000 and scale up to $3.25 for each $1.00 of team salary that is from $15,000 to $20,000 over the threshold, and an additional tax rate increment of $0.50 applies for each additional $5,000 (or part thereof) of team salary in excess of $20,000 over the threshold. In addition, for teams that are taxpayers in at least three of four previous seasons, the above tax rates are increased by $1.00 for each increment. Fifty percent of the aggregate luxury tax payments is a funding source for the revenue sharing plan and the remaining 50% of such payments is distributed in equal shares to non-taxpaying teams. For the 2018-19, 2017-18, and 2016-17 seasons, the Knicks were not a luxury tax payer and we recorded approximately $3,100, $2,200, and $500, respectively, of luxury tax proceeds from tax-paying teams. Tax obligations for years beyond the 2018-19 season will be subject to contractual player payroll obligations and corresponding NBA luxury tax thresholds. The Company recognizes the estimated amount associated with luxury tax expense or the amount it expects to receive as a non-tax paying team, if applicable, on a straight-line basis over the NBA regular season as a component of direct operating expenses.\nNBA Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NBA CBA also provides that players collectively receive a designated percentage of league-wide revenues (net of certain direct expenses) as compensation (approximately 51%), and the teams retain the remainder. The percentage of league-wide revenues paid as compensation and retained by the teams does not apply evenly across all teams and, accordingly, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Knicks' revenues than other NBA teams. Throughout each season, NBA teams withhold 10% of each player's salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league's aggregate player compensation exceeds the designated percentage of league-wide revenues, some or all of such escrowed amounts are distributed equally to all NBA teams. In the event that the league's aggregate player compensation is below the designated percentage of league-wide revenues, the teams will remit the shortfall to the NBPA for distribution to the players.\nThe NBA also has a revenue sharing plan that generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds to teams with below-average net revenues (as defined in the plan), subject to reduction or elimination based on individual team market size and profitability. The plan is funded by a combination of disproportionate contributions from teams with above-average net revenues, subject to certain profit-based limits (each as defined in the plan); 50% of aggregate league-wide luxury tax proceeds (see above); and collective league sources, if necessary. Additional amounts may also be distributed on a discretionary basis, funded by assessments on playoff ticket revenues and through collective league sources.\nWe record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from the escrow. Our net provision for these items for the year ended June 30, 2019 was approximately $36,000. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 season may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NBA teams for the season and other factors.\nNHL CBA. The NHL CBA expires September 15, 2022 (although the NHL and NHL Players' Association each have the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2019-20 season). The NHL CBA provides for a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team's aggregate player salaries) and a hard\u201d salary cap (i.e., teams may not exceed a stated maximum that was negotiated for the 2013-14 season and has been adjusted each season thereafter based upon league-wide revenues).\nNHL Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NHL CBA provides that each season the players receive as player compensation 50% of that season's league-wide revenues. Because the aggregate amount to be paid to the players is based upon league-wide revenues and not on a team-by-team basis, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Rangers' revenues than other NHL teams pay of their own revenues. In order to implement the salary cap system, NHL teams withhold a portion of each player's salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league's aggregate player compensation for a season exceeds the designated percentage (50%) of that season's league-wide revenues, the excess is retained by the league. Any such excess funds are distributed to all teams in equal shares.\nThe NHL CBA also provides for a revenue sharing plan. The plan generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds approximating 6.055% of league-wide revenues to certain qualifying lower-revenue teams and is funded as follows: (a) 50% from contributions by the top ten revenue earning teams (based on pre-season and regular season revenues) in accordance with a formula; (b) then from payments by teams participating in the playoffs, with each team contributing 35% of its gate receipts for each home playoff game; and (c) the remainder from centrally-generated NHL sources. We record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from the escrow. Our net provisions for these items for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $23,300 and $21,100, respectively. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 and 2017-18 seasons may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NHL teams for the season and other factors.\nOther Team Operating Expenses\nOur teams also pay expenses associated with day-to-day operations, including for travel, equipment maintenance and player insurance. Direct variable day-of-event costs incurred at The Garden, such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security, and event production are charged to our MSG Sports segment.\nOperating costs of the Company's training center in Greenburgh, NY are also charged to our MSG Sports segment. The operation of the Hartford Wolf Pack is also a net Rangers player development expense for our MSG Sports segment.\nAs members of the NBA and NHL, the Knicks and Rangers, respectively, are also subject to league assessments. The governing bodies of each league determine the amount of each season's league assessments that are required from each member team. The NBA imposed on each team a 6% assessment on regular season ticket revenue.\nOur MSG Sports segment also incurs costs associated with VIP amenities provided to certain ticket holders.\nOther Expenses\nMSG Sports also incurs selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nThe operating results of our MSG Sports segment are largely dependent on the continued popularity and/or on-ice or on-court competitiveness of our Rangers and Knicks teams, which have a direct effect on ticket sales for the teams' home games and are each team's largest single source of revenue, as well as our ability to attract high-caliber sporting events. As with other sports teams, the competitive positions of our sports teams depend primarily on our ability to develop, obtain and retain talented players, for which we compete with other professional sports teams. A significant factor in our ability to attract and retain talented players is player compensation. Our MSG Sports segment results reflect the impact of high costs for player salaries (including NBA luxury tax, if any) and salaries of non-player team personnel. In addition, we have incurred significant charges for costs associated with transactions relating to players on our sports teams for season-ending and career-ending injuries and for trades, waivers and contract terminations of players and other team personnel, including team executives. Waiver and termination costs reflect our efforts to improve the competitiveness of our sports teams. These transactions can result in significant charges as the Company recognizes the estimated ultimate costs of these events in the period in which they occur, although amounts due to these individuals are generally paid over their remaining contract terms. For example, the expense for these items was $53,134, $27,514 and $42,337 for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenses add to the volatility of the results of our MSG Sports segment. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to improve the overall quality of our sports teams and our efforts may result in continued significant expenses and charges. Such expenses and charges may result in future operating losses for our MSG Sports segment although it is not possible to predict their timing or amount. Our MSG Sports segment's performance has been, and may in the future be, impacted by work stoppages. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - General Risks - Organized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn addition to our MSG Sports segment's future performance being dependent upon the continued popularity and/or on-ice or on-court competitiveness of our Rangers and Knicks teams, it is also dependent on general economic conditions, in particular those in the New York City metropolitan area, and the effect of these conditions on our customers. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations as it may lead to lower demand for suite licenses and tickets to the games of our sports teams, which would also negatively affect merchandise and concession sales, as well as decrease levels of sponsorship and venue signage revenues. These conditions may also affect the number of other live sporting events that this segment is able to present.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nAdoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers\nThe Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606. As a result, the Company's revenues were lower by $22,996 and direct operating expenses were lower by $26,239 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in net decreases in MSG Entertainment's revenues and direct operating expenses of $24,347 and $24,545, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the application of principal versus agent revenue recognition on event-related food, beverage and merchandise activities. For the MSG Sports' operating results, the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in a net increase in revenues of $1,351 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily associated with professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues. In addition, the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in a decrease in direct operating expenses of $1,694 for the year ended June 30, 2019, due to the application of principal versus agent revenue recognition on event-related food, beverage and merchandise activities.\nPrior year period results have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC Topic 606 and, therefore, the Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 are not directly comparable to results for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nUnder ASC Topic 606, the suite license revenues for the Company's MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments are now recognized proportionately as events at The Garden take place, as opposed to being recognized on a straight-line basis over the fiscal year under the prior standard. In addition, most of local media rights revenue is now recognized over the course of the regular season, as opposed to being recognized on a straight-line basis over the fiscal year under the prior standard.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Note 3. Revenue Recognition for further discussion of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nRenewal of a Ticketing Agreement\nThe Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the recognition of revenue for events that took place during prior year due to the renewal of the agreement with the Company's ticketing platform provider during fiscal year 2019. The following table presents the impact on the Company's consolidated revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 from events in the prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. Table 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Entertainment segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Sports segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MSG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Expenses and Venue Operating Costs\nThe Company allocates certain corporate costs and its performance venues operating expenses to both reportable segments. Allocated performance venue operating expenses include the non-event related costs of operating the Company's performance venues, and include such costs as rent for the Company's leased venues, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and labor related to the overall management of the venues. Depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden and the Forum is not allocated to the reportable segments.\nPurchase Accounting Adjustments\nIn connection with the BCE, TAO Group, CLG and Obscura acquisitions in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 ( Recent Business Acquisitions\u201d), the Company recorded certain fair value adjustments related to acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations. For the Company's Recent Business Acquisitions, the Company recognized fair value adjustments primarily for (i) recognition of intangible assets such as trade names, venue management contracts, favorable leases, and festival rights, (ii) step-up of property and equipment, (iii) step-up of inventory, (iv) unfavorable lease obligation, and (v) goodwill. The aforementioned fair value adjustments, except for goodwill, will be expensed as incremental non-cash expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations based on their estimated useful lives ( Purchase Accounting Adjustments\u201d). The Company does not allocate any Purchase Accounting Adjustments to the reporting segments and reports any Purchase Accounting Adjustments as reconciliation items in reporting segment operating results. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19.

Selling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative costs, including compensation, professional fees, sales and marketing costs, including non-event related advertising expenses, business development costs, as well as costs associated with the development of MSG Sphere, including technology and content development costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $31,507, or 34%, to $123,347 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) higher professional fees, inclusive of costs associated with the potential Sports Distribution, and (iii) the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs not related to its third-party production business.\nIn connection with its MSG Sphere initiative, the Company expects to continue increasing its investment in personnel, content and technology. Based on the timing of these efforts, the Company expects increased expenses in Corporate and Other in fiscal year 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $3,293, or 3%, to $119,193 as compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized.\nOperating loss - Corporate and Other\nOperating loss in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $29,276, or 17%, to $199,592 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of depreciation and amortization under Corporate and Other.\nEarnings (loss) in equity method investments\nEarnings in equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2019 were $7,062 as compared to a loss of $7,770 in the prior year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to (i) the improvement in the net earnings attributable to the Company's investees as compared to the prior year, (ii) the gain on the sale of an Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC ( AMSGE\u201d) investment during the current year prior to the Company's sale of its interest in AMSGE, and (iii) a gain on the sale of the Company's interest in AMSGE during the current year. The increase was partially offset by an impairment charge recorded for the Company's investment in Tribeca Enterprises LLC ( Tribeca Enterprises\u201d) and the amortization of basis difference attributable to intangible assets for the new investments in the current year. The Company sold its interest in Tribeca Enterprises, including the outstanding loan and PIK, effective August 5, 2019. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of an impairment charge recorded for the Company's investment in Tribeca Enterprises.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $3,628, or 59%, to $9,795 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher interest income earned by the Company as a result of higher interest rate. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense incurred under the TAO Senior Credit Agreement and 2017 TAO Credit Agreement. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the TAO Senior Credit Agreement entered in May 2019.\nMiscellaneous expenses, net\nMiscellaneous expenses, net in the current year principally consist of (i) a loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, (ii) non-service components of net period pension and post retirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07, and (iii) dividend income from the Company's investment in TSQ. Miscellaneous expenses, net in the prior year principally consist of non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d) significantly changed U.S. tax law and included a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $1,348 and income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $116,872.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $1,348 differs from income tax benefits derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to pretax loss primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance of $9,421, tax expense of $8,651 relating to nondeductible officers' compensation and tax expense of $3,054 relating to noncontrolling interests. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the statutory federal rate to the effective tax rate.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company used a blended statutory federal income rate of 28% based upon the number of days that it would be taxed at the former rate of 35% and the number of days it would be taxed at the new rate of 21%, effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 of $116,872 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the blended statutory federal rate of 28% to pretax income primarily as a result of a deferred income tax benefit of $113,494 related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities under provisions contained in the new tax legislation, of which (i) $51,015 was due to the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the lower federal income tax rate of 21%, and (ii) $62,479 was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to the new rules, which provide that future federal net operating losses have an unlimited carry-forward period. These rules on future federal net operating losses allow the Company to recognize a portion of its unrecognized deferred tax assets for future deductible items. Other decreases to the statutory rate include $13,211 of income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which offsets the income tax expense attributable to most of the operating income, and $1,974 of income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $1,800 of tax expense related to state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit), (ii) $1,998 of tax expense primarily related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) $2,006 of tax expense related to consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iv) $846 of tax expense related to a change in state tax rates and (v) $223 of other.\nAdjusted operating income\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is their operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits, and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, which is referred to as adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure. In addition to excluding the impact of items discussed above, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions is also excluded in evaluating the Company's consolidated adjusted operating income (loss). The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss).\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income: Table 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase accounting adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\n (a) Depreciation and amortization included purchase accounting adjustments of $17,531 and $18,134 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \n (b) Other purchase accounting adjustments for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 primarily included the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.  Adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $28,206, or 14%, to $169,758 as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in adjusted operating income of the MSG Entertainment segment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in adjusted operating income of the MSG Sports segment\n</td> <td>(5,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in adjusted operating loss in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>(22,468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inter-segment eliminations\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncrease in adjusted operating loss in Corporate and Other was lower than the increase in operating loss in Corporate and Other primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization.\nNet loss attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $7,299 and a net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of $7,245 as compared to $628 of net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and $6,518 of net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended June 30, 2018. These amounts represent the share of net loss of TAO Group, BCE, and CLG that are not attributable to the Company. In addition, the net loss attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests includes a proportional share of expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments.\nBusiness Segment Results\nMSG Entertainment\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Entertainment segment.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>819,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>780,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to adjusted operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n-----\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nThe results of operations of the MSG Entertainment segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include Obscura's results of operations associated with its third-party production business from the date of acquisition, which was November 20, 2017. The current year results include activities from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. The Company made a decision to wind down Obscura's third-party production business to focus on MSG Sphere development.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $39,204, or 5%, to $819,930 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in event-related revenues from concerts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular\n</td> <td>14,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in revenues associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings\n</td> <td>10,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues\n</td> <td>9,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in revenues from Obscura\n</td> <td>5,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in event-related revenues from other live events\n</td> <td>(16,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in BCE event-related revenues\n</td> <td>(3,255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net decreases\n</td> <td>(1,080\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in event-related revenues from concerts was primarily due to additional events and higher per event revenue during the current year, and to a lesser extent, the impact from the recognition during the current year of $1,278 of revenue associated with events that took place in prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. The increase was partially offset by the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year.\nThe increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to (i) higher ticket-related revenue mainly as a result of higher average ticket prices, (ii) an increase in paid attendance in the current year as compared to the prior year, and (iii) the recognition during the current year of $880 of revenue associated with performances that took place in prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. The Company had 210 performances of the production in fiscal year 2019, as compared to 200 performances in fiscal year 2018 due to an extension of the show's run announced in December 2018. For fiscal year 2019, more than one million tickets were sold, representing a mid-single digit percentage increase as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings was primarily due to the impact of the opening of a new venue, partially offset by (i) the impact of the current year containing 52 weeks of operations as compared to 53 weeks during the prior year, due to the timing of the retail calendar, (ii) closing of one venue, and other decreases. TAO Group's operating results are recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2019 are for the period from April 2, 2018 to March 31, 2019, as compared to TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2018, which are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018.\nThe increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues was due to increased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory and rate increases in suite licenses.\nRevenues from Obscura are included as a result of its acquisition by the Company on November 20, 2017. The current year results include revenues from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. Revenues from Obscura are principally related to its third-party production business.\nThe decrease in event-related revenues from other live events was primarily due to (i) the impact of a large-scale special event series held at The Garden and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden during the prior year, (ii) lower per-event revenue during the current year as compared to the prior year and, to a lesser extent, (iii) the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year. The decrease was slightly offset by additional events held at the Company's venues during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related revenues was primarily due to lower ticket-related revenues from the Boston Calling Music Festival.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $24,218, or 5%, to $507,091 as compared to the prior year.

The current year results include direct operating expenses from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. Direct operating expenses from Obscura are principally related to third-party production business.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to (i) higher labor costs, (ii) higher costs associated with more performances in the current year, (iii) costs related to show enhancements, and (iv) higher marketing expenses during the current year as compared to the prior year. The Company had 210 performances of the production in fiscal year 2019, as compared to 200 performances in fiscal year 2018 due to an extension of the show's run announced in December 2018.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite licenses was primarily due to increased sales of existing sponsorship inventory.\nThe decrease in event-related direct operating expenses from other live events was primarily due to (i) the impact of a large-scale special event series held at The Garden and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden during the prior year, (ii) the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year, and (iii) to a lesser extent, lower per event expenses during the current year as compared to prior year. The decrease was slightly offset by additional events held at the Company's venues during the current year as compared to prior year.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related direct operating expenses was due to lower costs related to the Boston Calling Music Festival in the current year as compared to prior year.\nThe decrease in event-related direct operating expenses from concerts was primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year. The decrease was largely offset by additional events held at the Company's venues and higher per event expenses during the current year as compared to prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $16,576, or 9%, to $208,577 as compared to the prior year mainly due to (i) higher employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) an increase in professional fees, (iii) venue pre-opening costs associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings, and (iv) the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs related to its third-party production business for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. The increase was partially offset by the impact of certain costs being reported as direct operating expenses during the current year as compared to being reported as selling, general and administrative expenses during the prior year.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $1,245, or 1%, to $86,092 as compared to the prior year due to increases in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses largely offset by higher revenues as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $4 to $118,348 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was lower than a decrease in operating income primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nMSG Sports\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Sports segment.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>812,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,580\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to adjusted operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $34,093, or 4%, to $812,746 as compared to the prior year.

The Liberty played ten fewer regular season games at The Garden during the current year as compared to the prior year, as the Liberty played the majority of their home games at the Westchester County Center, located in White Plains, NY, during the current year. Additionally, the Liberty was sold in January 2019.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $28,967, or 6%, to $485,899 as compared to the prior year.

Team personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflect provisions recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $21,559, (ii) season-ending player injuries of $4,273, which is net of insurance recoveries of $468 and (iii) player trades of $1,682.\nThe increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax reflects higher provisions for league revenue sharing expense of $1,647, partially offset by higher estimated NBA luxury tax credit of $914. Higher league revenue sharing expense primarily reflected higher estimated NHL and NBA revenue sharing expense for the 2018-19 season, partially offset by higher estimated net player escrow recoveries and, to a lesser extent, net adjustments to prior seasons' revenue sharing expense. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 season may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors. The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2018-19 and 2017-18 seasons and, therefore, received equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams.\nThe increase in event-related expenses associated with other live sporting events was due to higher per event expenses, slightly offset by fewer events during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in other team operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in league assessments and other net increases, partially offset by lower player insurance costs and lower day-of-event costs, primarily driven by the Liberty playing fewer games at The Garden during the current year as compared to the prior year. During the current year, the majority of the Liberty's home games were played at the Westchester County Center, located in White Plains, NY. Additionally, the Liberty was sold in January 2019.\nThe decrease in team personnel compensation was primarily due to roster changes at the Company's sports teams.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $11,409, or 6%, to $196,548 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits and an increase in marketing costs.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $6,580, or 5%, to $122,521 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher direct operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $5,408, or 4%, to $146,672, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was lower than the decrease in operating income primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nComparison of the Year Ended June 30, 2018 versus the Year Ended June 30, 2017\nFactors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\nTAO Group's Operating Results\nThe Company completed the TAO Group acquisition on January 31, 2017. TAO Group's financial statements are not available within the time constraints the Company requires to ensure the financial accuracy of the operating results. Therefore, the Company records TAO Group's operating results in its consolidated statements of operations under the MSG Entertainment segment on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related operating results for the year ended June 30, 2018 are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018. TAO Group's related operating results for the year ended June 30, 2017 are for the period from February 1, 2017 to March 26, 2017.\nCLG's Operating Results\nThe results of operations of the Company and the MSG Sports segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include CLG's results of operations from the date of acquisition, which was July 28, 2017.

In addition, the direct operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 principally reflect the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.  Selling, general and administrative expenses - Corporate and Other\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $12,400, or 16%, to $91,840 as compared to prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits, as well as the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs not related to its third-party production business. The increase was partially offset by a management fee earned for providing management and strategic services to TAO Group (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion), which is eliminated in the Company's consolidated results of operations presented above, as well as certain favorable adjustments related to contingent payments for the Company's business acquisitions.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $15,098, or 14%, to $122,486 as compared to the prior year primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments and the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment associated with the business acquisitions (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\u201d for further discussion), partially offset by certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized.\nOperating loss - Corporate and Other\nOperating loss in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,298, or 4%, to $170,316 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of depreciation and amortization under Corporate and Other.\nLoss in equity method investments\nLoss in equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2018 improved $22,206, or 74%, to $7,770 as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $20,613 recorded during the prior year to write off the carrying value of the equity method investment in Fuse Media.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $1,480, or 19%, to $6,167 as compared to the prior year primarily due to interest expense incurred under the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for discussion. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income earned by the Company as a result of higher interest rates and a change in investment mix. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized interest income of $938, which was received in connection with the repayment of a loan receivable from one of the Company's nonconsolidated affiliates that was on a nonaccrual status.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net for the year ended June 30, 2018 principally consist of non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07. Miscellaneous income in the prior year consists principally of (i) non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07 and (ii) the recovery of certain claims in connection with a third-party bankruptcy proceeding. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, TCJA was enacted, which significantly changed the existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company was required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment even though certain key aspects of the new law became effective January 1, 2018. The Company used a blended statutory federal income tax rate of 28% based upon the number of days that it will be taxed at the former rate of 35% and the number of days it will be taxed at the new rate of 21% to calculate its most recent effective tax rate.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $116,872 and income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $4,404.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 of $116,872 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the blended statutory federal rate of 28% to pretax income primarily as a result of a deferred income tax benefit of $113,494 related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities under provisions contained in the new tax legislation, of which (i) $51,015 was due to the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the lower federal income tax rate of 21%, and (ii) $62,479 was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to the new rules, which provide that future federal net operating losses have an unlimited carry-forward period. These rules on future federal net operating losses allow the Company to recognize a portion of its unrecognized deferred tax assets for future deductible items. Other decreases to the statutory rate include $13,211 of income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which offsets the income tax expense attributable to most of the operating income, and $1,974 of income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $1,800 of tax expense related to state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit), (ii) $1,998 of tax expense primarily related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) $2,006 of tax expense related to consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iv) $846 of tax expense related to a change in state tax rates and (v) $223 of other.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $4,404 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 35% to pretax income primarily as a result of (i) an increase of $30,697 in recorded federal and state valuation allowances, (ii) tax expense of $3,449 related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) the tax impact of consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests of $1,414, (iv) deferred expense of $1,329 based on tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles that are not available as a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets, and (v) expense of $672 recorded due to a state rate change computed as a result of filed state tax returns. This tax expense is offset by (i) $6,716 of state tax benefit (net of federal effect), (ii) $6,477 of tax benefit related to other comprehensive income gains recorded in continuing operations and (iii) $354 of other.\nAdjusted operating income\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase accounting adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\n (a) Depreciation and amortization included purchase accounting adjustments of $18,134 and $3,152 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (b) Other purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily included the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition. Other purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily included an inventory adjustment of $8,705 that was expensed to direct operating expenses and associated with the TAO Group acquisition on January 31, 2017 as the related inventory was consumed.  Adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $96,291, or 95%, to $197,964 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in adjusted operating income of the MSG Entertainment segment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in adjusted operating income of the MSG Sports segment\n</td> <td>6,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in adjusted operating loss in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>(5,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inter-segment eliminations\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncrease in adjusted operating loss in Corporate and Other were primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits, excluding share-based compensation expense, and the inclusion of Obscura expenses associated with the Company's business development initiatives partially offset by a management fee earned for providing management and strategic services to TAO Group (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion), which is eliminated in the Company's consolidated results of operations presented above. These increases were offset by certain favorable adjustments related to contingent payments for the Company's business acquisitions.\nNet income (loss) attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $628 and a net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of $6,518 as compared to $4,370 of net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and $304 of net income attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended June 30, 2017. These amounts represent the share of net income (loss) of TAO Group, BCE, and CLG that are not attributable to the Company. In addition, the net income (loss) attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests includes a proportional share of expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments.

See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at The Garden was due to a change in the mix of events (including the impact of a large-scale event held during the current year) and additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at Radio City Music Hall, excluding the Christmas Spectacular and the New York Spectacular, was primarily due to additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at the Forum was due to a change in the mix of events and an additional event held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden was primarily due to a change in the mix of events partially offset by fewer events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at The Chicago Theatre was primarily due to additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to higher ticket-related revenue, mainly as a result of higher average ticket prices and the impact of additional scheduled performances, partially offset by a decrease in average per-show paid attendance in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year. The Company had 200 scheduled performances of the production during the 2018 holiday season as compared to 197 scheduled performances during the 2017 holiday season. For the 2017 holiday season, more than one million tickets were sold, representing a low single digit percentage decrease as compared to the 2016 holiday season.\nThe increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues was due to higher suite rental fee revenue mainly driven by contractual rate increases.\nThe decrease in revenues from the presentation of the New York Spectacular was driven by no scheduled performances in fiscal year 2018 as compared to 56 scheduled performances presented in the prior year. This was a result of the Company's decision to suspend the planned 2017 presentation announced in February 2017.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related revenues was primarily due to a decrease in ticket-related revenue.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $104,911, or 28%, to $482,873 as compared to the prior year.

The Company had 200 scheduled performances of the production during the 2018 holiday season as compared to 197 scheduled performances during the 2017 holiday season.\nThe decrease in direct operating expenses associated with the presentation of the New York Spectacular was driven by no scheduled performances in fiscal year 2018 as compared to 56 scheduled performances presented in the prior year. This was a result of the Company's decision to suspend the planned 2017 presentation announced in February 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $72,449, or 61%, to $192,001 as compared to the prior year mainly due to (i) inclusion of TAO Group's selling, general and administrative costs, including a management fee incurred by TAO Group payable to the Company for providing management and strategic services and, to a lesser extent, (ii) higher professional fees and (iii) an increase in corporate general and administrative costs.

These decreases were partially offset by other net increases, inclusive of league distributions related to CLG, which was acquired on July 28, 2017.\nThe decrease in event-related revenues from other live sporting events was due to a change in the mix of events held during the fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year and one event that generated lower revenue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues and ad sales commissions was primarily due to sales of new sponsorship and signage inventory, increased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory and the impact of a marketing partner, upon renewal of its agreement, shifting its marketing partnership spend from a combination of entertainment and sports entirely to sports.\nThe increase in local media rights fees from MSG Networks was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' pre/regular season ticket-related revenues was primarily due to higher average Rangers per-game revenue, partially offset by lower average Liberty and Knicks per-game revenue.\nThe increase in suite rental fee revenue was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $16,063, or 3%, to $456,932 as compared to the prior year.

Lower NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense primarily reflects an increase in estimated net player escrow recoveries, partially offset by higher estimated NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense for the 2017-18 season and, to a lesser extent, net adjustments to prior season's revenue sharing expense. The increase in estimated NBA luxury tax receipt is based on the Knicks' roster, which as of June 30, 2018 did not result in luxury tax for the 2017-18 season. The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2016-17 season and, therefore, received an equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams. The actual amounts for the 2017-18 season may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors.\nTeam personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflect provisions recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $21,559, (ii) season-ending player injuries of $4,273, which is net of insurance recoveries of $468 and (iii) player trades of $1,682. Team personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2017 reflect provisions recorded for waivers/contract terminations and player trades of $13,979 and $8,000, respectively.\nThe increase in other team operating expenses was primarily due to higher day-of-event costs and league expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $22,820, or 11%, to $185,139 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower employee compensation and related benefits, and to a lesser extent, lower marketing costs, partially offset by an increase in corporate general and administrative costs. The reduction in employee compensation and related benefits as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by severance-related costs in the prior year, which were attributable to a separation agreement with a team executive.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $1,838, or 20%, to $7,481 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an intangible asset becoming fully amortized.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,390, or 6%, to $129,101 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $6,502, or 4%, to $152,080, as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expense, and direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our businesses and maximum borrowing capacity under our $390,000 revolving credit facilities. Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related items, capital spending (including our planned construction of large-scale venues in Las Vegas and London), investments and related loans that we may fund from time to time, repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, repayment of debt, and the payment of earn-out obligations and mandatory purchases from prior acquisitions. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, challenging U.S. and global economic conditions could adversely impact its ability to do so at that time.\nWe regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. Without regard to the impact of the potential Sports Distribution, which would have a positive impact on the Company's liquidity, if and when it is completed, we believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately $1,086,000 in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $108,000 of short-term investments as of June 30, 2019, along with available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities combined with operating cash flows, over the next 12 months, to fund our operations, to pursue the development of the new venues discussed below and other new business opportunities and to repurchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (see Note 2 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's short-term investments).\nTAO Group's principal uses of cash include working capital related-items, investments in new venues, tax-related cash distributions, interest expense payments and repayment of debt. TAO Group plans to continue to grow its business through the opening of new venues. TAO Group regularly monitors and assesses its ability to meet its funding and investment requirements. Over the next 12 months, the Company believes that TAO Group has sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, cash generated from operations and its revolving credit facility to fund its operations, service debt obligations and pursue new business opportunities.\nMSG Spheres\nThe Company has made significant progress on MSG Sphere at The Venetian, its state-of-the-art entertainment venue currently under construction in Las Vegas.\nWe view both innovative design and cost management as key imperatives to the construction process. While it is always difficult to provide a definitive construction cost estimate for large-scale construction projects, it is particularly challenging for one as unique as MSG Sphere. In May, our Board of Directors approved a preliminary cost estimate of $1,200,000 based upon schematic designs for purposes of developing the Company's budget and financial projections. We expect the estimation process for MSG Sphere construction costs will be dynamic as the project moves forward. The actual construction costs for MSG Sphere in Las Vegas incurred through June 30, 2019 were approximately $109,000.\nIn June, the Company announced that it engaged AECOM - a leading builder known for creating bold, innovative projects - as its general contractor for the Las Vegas project. We made the strategic decision to enter into a cost plus\u201d construction contract with AECOM. While this type of contract adds to the complexity of the cost estimation process, we believe our cost plus\u201d construction contract with AECOM will help our efforts to maximize the quality of the work, while permitting us to play a more vigilant role in managing the project's costs, including full transparency into the selection of, negotiations with, and labor and materials utilized by subcontractors.\nIn order to further drive cost control, under the terms of the construction contract, AECOM will receive lower fees if the hard\u201d construction costs come in greater than an incentive benchmark\u201d agreed upon by the Company and AECOM. The process of setting the incentive benchmark began in July when AECOM provided the Company with its proposal, representing its estimate of the hard construction costs of the project. AECOM's initial benchmark proposal, together with the costs of additional core technology and estimated soft costs, results in a project cost estimate that is approximately $1,700,000. We believe this cost estimate is too high and are now in the contractual process of reviewing, testing and challenging the elements of AECOM's estimates and assumptions. We are also value engineering aspects of the project to further reduce costs. We intend to do this in a granular fashion using, among other resources, our outside project manager. We believe we will be successful in achieving significant cost reductions through this process, while noting that there are no assurances that we will reach an agreement on the incentive benchmark.\nThe above cost estimates for the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas have been reduced to reflect the $75,000 that the Las Vegas Sands Corp. has agreed to pay the Company to defray the construction costs of a pedestrian bridge that will link the venue to the Sands Expo Convention Center. The estimates and costs also do not contain significant capitalized and non-capitalized costs for items\nsuch as content creation, internal labor costs, and furniture and equipment. As with any major construction project, the construction of MSG Spheres is subject to potential unexpected delays, costs or other complications. Our goal is to open MSG Sphere in Las Vegas in calendar year 2021.\nSee Exhibit 10.65 to this Form 10-K for a copy of the Construction Agreement, dated May 13, 2019, by and between MSG Las Vegas, LLC and Hunt Construction Group Inc. (AECOM).\nIn February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to the Company's second MSG Sphere and first large-scale international venue. Cost estimates for MSG Sphere in London are still in development as the Company continues to refine its design, which it currently expects will be substantially similar to MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, including having approximately the same seating capacity. The Company submitted a planning application to the local planning authority in March 2019 and expects a planning determination by the end of calendar year 2019 (which may become the subject of further discussions with the planning authority). Our plan is to begin construction on the MSG Sphere venue in London only once we have received all necessary approvals and have further advanced our design for the venue.\nWe anticipate that MSG Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial incremental revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis. For additional information regarding the Company's capital expenditures related to the MSG Spheres, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn connection with these efforts, the Company will need to pursue additional capital beyond that which is available from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital.\nThe potential Sports Distribution, if consummated, will provide the Company with additional liquidity, some or all of which could be used to finance part of the cost of constructing the MSG Spheres. The current plan for the Sports Distribution contemplates that the Company would retain up to about one-third of the common stock of Sports Spinco. Some or all of that interest could be sold for cash by the Company.\nWe will continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where we believe next-generation venues such as the MSG Sphere can be successful.\nFinancing Agreements, Revolving Credit Facilities Provided to Nonconsolidated Affiliates and Stock Repurchases\nFinancing Agreements\nOn September 30, 2016, New York Knicks, LLC ( Knicks LLC\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $200,000 with a term of five years (the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.

The TAO Senior Credit Agreement provides TAOG with senior secured credit facilities (the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) consisting of: (i) an initial $40,000 term loan facility with a term of five years and (ii) a $25,000 revolving credit facility with a term of five years (the TAO Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities were obtained without recourse to the Company or any of its affiliates (other than TAOG, TAOIH and its subsidiaries). The outstanding amount drawn\non the TAO Revolving Credit Facility was $15,000 as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, TAOIH was in compliance with the required financial covenants.\nOn May 23, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of TAO Group Holdings LLC entered into an intercompany subordinated term loan credit agreement providing for a credit facility of $49,000 that matures in August 2024 (the TAO Subordinated Credit Facility\u201d). The balances and interest-related activities pertaining to the TAO Subordinated Credit Agreement have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. As of June 30, 2019, TAO Group Holdings LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenants.\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility, Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility, Rangers Revolving Credit Facility and the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facilities Provided to Nonconsolidated Affiliates, Financing Agreements and Stock Repurchases\nSee Note 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of the Company's revolving credit facility extended to a nonconsolidated affiliate and the Company's stock repurchases, respectively.\nBilateral Letters of Credit Lines\nThe Company has established bilateral credit lines with a bank to issue letters of credit in support of the Company's business operations. The Company pays fees for the letters of credit that are credited against interest income the Company receives in return from its investments in notes receivable with the same bank. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $12,512 of letters of credit outstanding pursuant to which fees were credited against note investments. Of which, TAO Group had two letters of credit outstanding for $750 as of March 31, 2019.\nCash Flow Discussion\nAs of June 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $1,117,901, as compared to $1,256,620 as of June 30, 2018. The following table summarizes the Company's cash flow activities for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(182,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(264,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,746\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158,525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(138,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(199,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $56,376 to $161,253 as compared to the prior year primarily due to changes in certain assets and liabilities, as well as a decrease in net income to a net loss in the current year adjusted for non-cash items. The changes in certain assets and liabilities are driven by decreases in collections due to promoters and prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by higher accrued and other liabilities, all due to timing. The decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items was impacted by earnings in equity method investments in the current year as compared to a loss in the prior year and lower depreciation and amortization in the current year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $5,903 to $217,629 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items including (i) a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effective January 1, 2018, (ii) a write-off of deferred production costs associated with the New York Spectacular in the prior year, and (iii) an impairment charge to write off the carrying value of the Company's equity investment in Fuse Media in the prior year, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year. This increase was offset by a severance-related payment in fiscal year 2018 attributable to a separation agreement with a team executive which was accrued for as of June 30, 2017 and a decrease in cash received related to deferred revenue primarily due to timing.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased by $50,538 to $232,895 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the Company's investment in a British pound-denominated time deposit and an investment in SACO, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of the Company's 50% interest in AMSGE.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $81,944 to $182,357 as compared to the prior year primarily due to (i) a net decrease in business acquisitions, (ii) repayments received from loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, and (iii) the acquisition of available-for-sale securities in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by (i) higher capital expenditures in fiscal year 2018, primarily associated with the purchase of land in London and costs incurred in developing the Company's new venues in Las Vegas and London, (ii) new investments made in nonconsolidated affiliates, and (iii) a franchise fee payment made in fiscal year 2018 associated with CLG's membership in the League of Legends\u201d North American League Championship Series.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased by $20,649 to $71,746 as compared to the prior year due to the repayment of all obligations under the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement partially offset by (i) proceeds received from borrowings under the TAO Senior Credit Agreement, (ii) lower taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation in the current year as compared to the prior year, (iii repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the prior year as compared to no repurchases in the current year, and other financing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $107,428 to $51,097 as compared to the prior year largely due to lower repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the current year as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by (i) higher taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year, (ii) distributions to noncontrolling interest holders related to the acquisition of TAO Group in fiscal year 2018 and (iii) a contingent consideration payment related to the acquisition of CLG in fiscal year 2018.\nContractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFuture cash payments required under contracts entered into by the Company in the normal course of business and outstanding letters of credit as of June 30, 2019 are summarized in the following table: Table 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off balance sheet arrangements: (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>377,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit (d)\n</td> <td>12,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>646,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations reflected on the balance sheet (e)\n</td> <td>117,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (f)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\n (a) Off balance sheet arrangements disclosed in the table above do not include MSG Sphere related commitments that are not reflected on the balance sheet of $1,049,781. Such arrangements are associated with the development and construction of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas. The timing of the future cash payments disclosed is uncertain and may change as the development and construction of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas progresses. \n (b) Contractual obligations not reflected on the balance sheet consist principally of the MSG Sports segment's obligations under employment agreements that the Company has with its professional sports teams' personnel that are generally guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination. \n (c) Operating lease obligations primarily represent future minimum rental payments on various long-term, noncancelable leases for the Company's venues, including the TAO Group venues, CLG facility, and various corporate offices. \n (d) Consist of letters of credit obtained by the Company as collateral for development of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas and lease agreements. \n (e) Consist primarily of amounts earned under employment agreements that the Company has with certain of its professional sports teams' personnel in the MSG Sports segment. In addition, the amount includes MSG Sphere related commitments of approximately $19,700, all due within fiscal year 2020. \n (f) Pension obligations have been excluded from the table above as the timing of the future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the future funding requirements under our pension obligations.  See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the revolving credit facilities provided by the Company to Tribeca Enterprises.\nIn connection with the TAO Group and CLG acquisitions, the Company has accrued contingent consideration liabilities as part of the purchase price. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the amount reflected on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. In addition, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the principal repayments required under the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the TAO Revolving Credit Facility.\nMSG and a subsidiary of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. entered into a 50-year ground lease in Las Vegas pursuant to which MSG has agreed to construct a large-scale venue. MSG has announced plans to construct an MSG Sphere on that site. See Item 1. Business - Our Business - Our Performance Venues - MSG Sphere.\u201d\nMSG has the right to increase its equity interest in TAO Group through a call right on the equity of the other TAO Group equityholders after the fifth anniversary of the closing date (January 31, 2022) and prior to such date in certain events. The other TAO Group equityholders have the right to put to TAO Group their equity interests in TAO Group after the fifth anniversary of the closing and, in certain circumstances to put to MSG prior to the fifth anniversary. The put and call prices are at fair market value (or in certain circumstances, subject to a discount). Consideration paid upon the exercise of any such put or call right shall be, at MSG's option, in cash, debt, or MSG Class A Common Stock, subject to certain limitations.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nThe dependence of the MSG Sports segment on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company's fiscal year. The dependence of the MSG Entertainment segment on revenues from the Christmas Spectacular generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income in the second quarter of the Company's fiscal year. In addition, while it does not have a material impact on seasonality of our business, the first and third calendar quarters are seasonally lighter quarters for TAO Group as compared to its second and fourth calendar quarters. As the Company consolidates TAO Group results of operations on a three-month lag basis, the seasonally lighter quarters for TAO will be reflected in the second and fourth quarters of the Company's fiscal year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Management believes its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the Company's arrangements with multiple performance obligations, primarily multi-year sponsorship agreements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets\nThe Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets accounted for approximately 58% of the Company's consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2019 and consisted of the following:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indefinite-lived intangible assets\n</td> <td>176,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortizable intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization\n</td> <td>220,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment, net\n</td> <td>1,380,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,170,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn assessing the recoverability of the Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, the Company must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve significant uncertainties and judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its long-lived and/or indefinite-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. The Company has two operating and reportable segments, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business.\nFor purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company has three reporting units across its two operating segments, which are MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and TAO Group. TAO Group was acquired after the annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2017 and represents a separate reporting unit within the MSG Entertainment segment for goodwill impairment testing.\nThe goodwill balance reported on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 by reporting unit was as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Sports\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSG Entertainment\n</td> <td>76,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TAO Group\n</td> <td>88,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company's reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.\nThe Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for all of the Company's reporting units for the fiscal year 2019 impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as:\n \u2022 macroeconomic conditions; \n \u2022 industry and market considerations; \n \u2022 cost factors; \n \u2022 overall financial performance of the reporting unit; \n \u2022 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and \n \u2022 relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets.  The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and there was no impairment of goodwill identified for any of its reporting units. Based on these impairment tests, the Company's MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and TAO Group reporting units had sufficient safety margins, defined as the excess of the amount by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value of each reporting unit (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). For MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment the most recent quantitative assessments were used in making this determination and due to the proximity of the acquisition date for TAO Group to the goodwill impairment test date, the initial purchase price was assumed to be the fair value of the TAO Group reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test. The Company believes that if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nIdentifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 by reportable segment:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sports franchises (MSG Sports segment)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trademarks (MSG Entertainment segment)\n</td> <td>62,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Photographic related rights (MSG Sports segment)\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets in the MSG Sports segment and the majority of the trademarks in the MSG Entertainment segment. These assessments considered the events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. Examples of such events and circumstances include:\n \u2022 cost factors; \n \u2022 financial performance; \n \u2022 legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors; \n \u2022 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; \n \u2022 industry and market considerations; and \n \u2022 macroeconomic conditions. \nThe Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and there were no impairments identified. Based on these impairment tests, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of each identifiable indefinite-lived intangible asset's estimated fair value over its respective carrying value. The Company believes that if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nFor other long-lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.\nThe estimated useful lives and net carrying values of the Company's intangible assets subject to amortization as of June 30, 2019 are as follows: Table 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nUseful Lives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>25 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venue management contracts\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>25 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable lease assets\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>16 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Season ticket holder relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-compete agreements\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>5.75 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Festival rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other intangibles\n</td> <td>3 months\n</td> <td>to\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has recognized intangible assets for trade names, venue management contracts, favorable lease assets, season ticket holder relationships, non-compete agreements, festival rights and other intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The Company has determined that these intangible assets have finite lives.\nThe useful lives of the Company's long-lived assets are based on estimates of the period over which the Company expects the assets to be of economic benefit to the Company. In estimating the useful lives, the Company considers factors such as, but not limited to, risk of obsolescence, anticipated use, plans of the Company, and applicable laws and permit requirements. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that its estimated useful lives are appropriate.\nContingent Consideration\nSome of the Company's acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating targets.\nThe fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, the Company estimates the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration that the Company will pay to the former owners as a liability in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company measures its contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy, which can result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the fair value of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of TAO Group and CLG.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan\nThe Company utilizes actuarial methods to calculate pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related net periodic benefit cost which are based on actuarial assumptions. Key assumptions, the discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are important elements of the plans' expense and liability measurement and we evaluate these key assumptions annually. Other assumptions include demographic factors, such as mortality, retirement age and turnover. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to various factors, including, but not limited to, changing economic and market conditions. Differences between actual and expected occurrences could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation recorded by the Company. Material changes in the costs of the plans may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of the plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in asset levels and changes in legislation. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best estimate regarding future expectations.\nAccumulated and projected benefit obligations reflect the present value of future cash payments for benefits. We use the Willis Towers Watson U.S. Rate Link: 40-90 Discount Rate Model (which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds) to discount these benefit payments on a plan by plan basis, to select a rate at which we believe each plan's benefits could be effectively settled. Additionally, the Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows ( Spot Rate Approach\u201d). The Company believes the Spot Rate Approach provides a more accurate measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.\nLower discount rates increase the present value of benefit obligations and will usually increase the subsequent year's net periodic benefit cost. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations as of June 30, 2019 for the Company's Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan were 3.58% and 3.18%, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in each of these assumed discount rates would increase the projected benefit obligations for the Company's Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan at June 30, 2019 by $5,950 and $80, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.25%, 3.90% and 4.19%, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the Company's Pension Plans. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.25%, 3.67% and 4.06%, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the Company's Postretirement Plan. A 25 basis point decrease in these assumed discount rates would increase the total net periodic benefit cost for the Company's Pension Plans by $100 and decrease net periodic benefit cost for Postretirement Plan by $6 for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plans' asset allocation structures over a long-term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling, and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward-looking economic outlook, and economic/financial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return was selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (a) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b) projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Company's funded pension plans was 3.72% for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company's funded plans. Adverse market performance in the future could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the Company which could increase the Company's funding requirements related to these plans, as well as negatively affect the Company's operating results by increasing the net periodic benefit cost. A 25 basis point decrease in the long-term return on pension plan assets assumption would increase net periodic pension benefit cost by $300 for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nAnother important assumption for our Postretirement Plan is healthcare cost trend rates. We developed our estimate of the healthcare cost trend rates through examination of the Company's claims experience and the results of recent healthcare trend surveys.\nAssumptions for healthcare cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligation for our Postretirement Plan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic\nBenefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Benefit\nObligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year\n</td> <td>7.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.75%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\n</td> <td>2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2027\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and benefit obligation for our postretirement plan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019: Table 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) on\nTotal of Service\nand Interest Cost\nComponents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) on\nBenefit Obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One percentage point increase\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One percentage point decrease\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGAAP includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in the Company's earnings that otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur. For example, while the expected long-term rate of return on the plans' assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year. These differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses, which are then amortized over time.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

This section provides a general description of our business, as well as other matters that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition and in anticipating future trends.\nResults of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our segments are MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides a discussion of our financial condition, as well as an analysis of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes summaries of (i) our primary sources of liquidity and (ii) our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements that existed at June 30, 2019.\nSeasonality of Our Business. This section discusses the seasonal performance of our MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment segments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies. This section includes a discussion of accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a sports and entertainment business comprised of dynamic and powerful assets and brands. The Company is comprised of two business segments: MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, which is built on a foundation of iconic venues and compelling content, including live sports and entertainment events that we create, produce and present. The Company conducts\na significant portion of its operations at venues that it either owns or operates under long-term leases. The Company owns Madison Square Garden ( The Garden\u201d) and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre in Chicago. In addition, the Company leases Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\nDescription of Our Segments\nMSG Entertainment\nOur MSG Entertainment segment, which represented approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019, is one of the country's leaders in live entertainment. MSG Entertainment produces, presents and hosts live entertainment events, including (i) concerts and (ii) other live events such as family shows, performing arts events and special events, in our diverse collection of venues. Those venues include The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum, and The Chicago Theatre. The scope of our collection of venues enables us to showcase acts that cover a wide spectrum of genres and popular appeal.\nAlthough we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows in which case we have economic risk relating to the event.\nMSG Entertainment also creates, produces and/or presents live productions that are performed in the Company's venues. This includes the Christmas Spectacular, which is the top grossing live holiday family show in North America, featuring the Rockettes. The Christmas Spectacular has been performed at Radio City Music Hall for 86 years and more than one million tickets were sold for performances during the 2018 holiday season.\nIn July 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. This was followed in January 2017 by the Company's purchase of a controlling interest in TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands. These companies are part of the MSG Entertainment segment. In November 2017, the Company acquired a 100% controlling interest in Obscura, a creative studio, recognized for its work in designing and developing next-generation immersive experiences. Revenues generated by Obscura's third-party production business (and related costs) are reflected in the MSG Entertainment segment. The Company has decided to wind down this third-party productions business to focus on MSG Sphere development. Any costs incurred by Obscura that are associated with MSG Sphere development that are not capitalized are reported in Corporate and Other\u201d.\nRevenue Sources\nOur primary sources of revenue in our MSG Entertainment segment are ticket sales to our audiences for live events that we produce or promote/co-promote and license fees for our venues paid by third-party promoters in connection with events that we do not produce or promote/co-promote. We also generate revenue from other sources, including facility and ticketing fees, concessions, sponsorships and signage, a portion of suite license fees at The Garden, merchandising and tours at certain of our venues. The amount of revenue and expense we record in our MSG Entertainment segment for a given event depends to a significant extent on whether we are promoting or co-promoting the event or are licensing our venue to a third party. In addition, a significant component of the MSG Entertainment segment revenues are generated by the TAO Group through entertainment dining and nightlife offerings, which primarily consist of food and beverage sales and venue management fees.\nTicket Sales and Suite Licenses\nFor our productions and for entertainment events in our venues that we promote, we recognize revenues from the sale of tickets to our audiences. We sell tickets to the public through our box office, via our web sites and ticketing agencies and through group sales. The amount of revenue we earn from ticket sales depends on the number of shows and the mix of events that we promote, the capacity of the venue used, the extent to which we can sell to fully utilize the capacity and our ticket prices. During the fiscal year 2017, we implemented significant changes to how we sell Christmas Spectacular tickets. By eliminating block sales to third party brokers, we brought a significant number of tickets back in-house, which created the opportunity for more customers to buy tickets to the production directly from us.\nThe Garden has 21 Event Level suites, 58 Lexus Madison Level suites, and 18 Signature Level suites. Suite licenses at The Garden are generally sold to corporate customers pursuant to multi-year licenses. Under standard suite licenses, the licensees pay an annual license fee, which varies depending on the location of the suite. The license fee includes, for each seat in the suite, tickets for events at The Garden for which tickets are sold to the general public, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, suite holders separately pay for food and beverage service in their suites at The Garden. Revenues from the sale of suite licenses are shared between our MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments.\nVenue License Fees\nFor entertainment events held at our venues that we do not produce, promote or co-promote, we typically earn revenue from venue license fees charged to the third-party promoter of the event. The amount of license fees we charge varies by venue, as well as by the size of the production and the number of days utilized, among other factors. Our fees typically include both the cost of renting space in our venues and costs for providing event staff, such as front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including stagehands, electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers and security as well as production services such as staging, lighting and sound.\nFacility and Ticketing Fees\nFor all public and ticketed entertainment events held in our venues, we also earn additional revenues on substantially all tickets sold, whether we promote/co-promote the event or license the venue to a third party. These revenues are earned in the form of certain fees and assessments, including the facility fee we charge, and vary by venue.\nConcessions\nWe sell food and beverages during substantially all entertainment events held at our venues. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of our concession revenues, we also generate revenue from catering for our suites at The Garden.\nMerchandise\nWe earn revenues from the sale of merchandise relating to our proprietary productions and other live entertainment events that take place at our venues. The majority of our merchandise revenues are generated through on-site sales during performances of our productions and other live events. We also generate revenues from the sales of our Christmas Spectacular merchandise, such as ornaments and apparel, through traditional retail channels. Typically, revenues from our merchandise sales at our non-proprietary events relate to sales of merchandise provided by the artist, the producer or promoter of the event and are generally subject to a revenue sharing arrangement.\nVenue Signage and Sponsorship\nWe earn revenues through the sale of signage space and sponsorship rights in connection with our venues, productions and other live entertainment events. Signage revenues generally involve the sale of advertising space at The Garden during entertainment events and otherwise in our venues.\nSponsorship rights may require us to use the name, logos and other trademarks of sponsors in our advertising and in promotions for our venues, productions and other live entertainment events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our productions, events and venues in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in our venues or in the community.\nEntertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings\nWe earn revenues from entertainment dining and nightlife offerings through our operations of the TAO Group's restaurants and nightlife and hospitality venues. These revenues primarily consist of food and beverage sales and banquet hosting services at TAO Group leased restaurants and nightclubs. In addition, we earn fees from our real estate partners for operating certain of our restaurants and nightclubs.\nExpenses\nOur MSG Entertainment segment's principal expenses are payments made to performers of our productions, staging costs and day-of-event costs associated with events, and advertising costs. We charge a portion of our actual expenses associated with the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of our venues, along with a portion of our corporate expenses, to our MSG Entertainment segment. However, the operating results of our MSG Entertainment segment benefit from the fact that no rent is charged to the segment for use of the Company's owned venues. We do not allocate to our segments depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden or the Forum.\nPerformer Payments\nOur productions are performed by talented actors, dancers, singers, musicians and entertainers. In order to attract and retain this talent, we are required to pay our performers an amount that is commensurate with both their abilities and the demand for their services from other entertainment companies. Our productions typically feature ensemble casts (such as the Rockettes), where most of our performers are paid based on a standard scale,\u201d pursuant to CBAs we negotiate with the performers' unions. Certain performers, however, have individually negotiated contracts.\nStaging Costs\nStaging costs for our proprietary events as well as other events that we promote include the costs of sets, lighting, display technologies, special effects, sound and all of the other technical aspects involved in presenting a live entertainment event. These costs vary substantially depending on the nature of the particular show, but tend to be highest for large-scale theatrical productions, such as the Christmas Spectacular. For concerts we promote, the performer usually provides a fully-produced show. Along with performer salaries, the staging costs associated with a given production are an important factor in the determination of ticket prices.\nDay-of-Event Costs\nFor days on which MSG Entertainment stages its productions, promotes an event or provides one of our venues to a third-party promoter under a license fee arrangement, the event is charged the variable costs associated with such event, including box office staff, stagehands, ticket takers, ushers, security, and other similar expenses. In situations where we provide our venues to a third-party promoter under a license fee arrangement, day-of-event costs are typically included in the license fees charged to the promoter.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nWe incur significant costs promoting our productions and other events through various advertising campaigns, including advertising on outdoor platforms and in newspapers, on television and radio, and on social and digital platforms. In light of the intense competition for entertainment events, such expenditures are a necessity to drive interest in our productions and encourage members of the public to purchase tickets to our shows.\nEntertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings Costs\nThrough our ownership in the operations of the TAO Group restaurants and nightlife and hospitality venues, we incur costs for providing food and beverage as well as banquet hosting services to our customers. Our dining and nightlife offering costs primarily include the following:\n \u2022 labor costs, consisting of restaurant management salaries, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related items, including taxes and fringe benefits; \n \u2022 food and beverage costs; \n \u2022 operating costs, consisting of maintenance, utilities, bank and credit card charges, and any other restaurant-level expenses; and \n \u2022 occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, insurance premiums and taxes.  Factors Affecting Operating Results\nThe operating results of our MSG Entertainment segment are largely dependent on our ability to attract concerts and other live events to our venues, as well as the continuing popularity of the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall. Our MSG Entertainment segment recognized an operating loss during the year ended June 30, 2017, which includes a $33,629 write-off of deferred production costs related to the New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes ( New York Spectacular\u201d).\nOur MSG Entertainment segment's future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of these conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower demand for our entertainment and nightlife offerings, suite licenses and tickets to our live productions, concerts, family shows and other events, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, as well as lower levels of sponsorship and venue signage. These conditions may also affect the number of concerts, family shows and other events that take place in the future. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to explore additional opportunities to expand our presence in the entertainment industry. Any new investment may not initially contribute to operating income, but is intended to become operationally profitable over time. Our results will also be affected by investments in, and the success of, new productions.\nMSG Sports\nOur MSG Sports segment, which represented approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019, owns and operates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (the Knicks\u201d), a founding member of the NBA, and the New York Rangers (the Rangers\u201d), one of the original six\u201d franchises of the NHL. MSG Sports also owns and operates the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (the AHL\u201d), which is the primary player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Company owns and operates an NBA G League\nteam, named the Westchester Knicks, which plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY. The Knicks and Rangers play their home games at The Garden. In January 2019, the Company sold the New York Liberty (the Liberty\u201d) of the Women's National Basketball Association (the WNBA\u201d). For all periods through the sale date, MSG Sports includes the Liberty. Our professional sports franchises are collectively referred to herein as our sports teams.\u201d The MSG Sports segment also includes CLG, a premier North American esports organization, and Knicks Gaming, MSG's franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League. CLG and Knicks Gaming are collectively referred to herein as our esports teams,\u201d and, together with our sports teams, our teams.\u201d In addition, our sports business also promotes, produces and/or presents a broad array of live sporting events including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, and college wrestling.\nRevenue Sources\nWe earn revenue in our MSG Sports segment from several primary sources: ticket sales and a portion of suite rental fees at The Garden, our share of distributions from NHL and NBA league-wide national and international television contracts and other league-wide revenue sources, venue signage and other sponsorships, concessions and merchandising. Our MSG Sports segment also earns substantial fees from MSG Networks for the local media rights to telecast the games of our professional sports teams. We also earn venue license fees, primarily from the rental of The Garden to third-party promoters or conferences holding sporting events at our arena. The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our sports teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our sports teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenue derives from rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our sports teams and our ability to attract other compelling sports content.\nTicket Sales, Suite Licenses, Venue Licenses, Facility and Ticketing Fees\nTicket sales have historically constituted the largest single source of revenue for our MSG Sports segment. We sell tickets to our sports teams' home games through season tickets, which are typically held by long-term season subscribers, through group sales, and through single-game tickets, which are purchased by fans either individually or in multi-game packages. The prices of our tickets vary, depending on the sports team and the location of the seats. We generally review and set the price of our tickets before the start of each team's season. During the fiscal year 2017 we made changes to our ticketing polices, resulting in fewer full season tickets sold and more sales of individual and group tickets, as well as partial season plans.\nRevenues from the sale of suite licenses are shared between the MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments. See - MSG Entertainment - Revenue Sources\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition to our sports teams' home games, we also present or host other live sporting events at our venues. When the Company acts as the promoter or co-promoter of such events, the Company typically earns revenues from ticket sales and incurs expenses associated with the event. When these events are promoted by third-party promoters, the Company typically earns venue license fees from the promoter for use of our venues. When licensing our venues, the amount recorded as revenue also includes the event's variable costs such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staffs, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security and building services, which we pass along to the promoter. The number and mix of live sporting events, including whether we are the promoter or co-promoter of an event or license our venues to a third-party promoter, could have a significant impact on the level of revenues and expenses that we record in our MSG Sports segment.\nOur MSG Sports segment also earns revenues in the form of certain fees added to ticket prices for events held at our venues, regardless of whether we act as promoter or co-promoter for such events. This currently includes a facility fee the Company charges on tickets it sells to all events at our venues, except for our sports teams' season tickets and certain other limited exceptions.\nMedia Rights\nWe earn revenue from the licensing of media rights for our sports teams' home and away games and also through the receipt of our share of fees paid for league-wide media rights, which are awarded under contracts negotiated and administered by each league.\nThe Company and MSG Networks are parties to media rights agreements covering the local telecast rights for the Knicks and Rangers. The financial success of our MSG Sports segment is significantly dependent on the rights fees we receive from MSG Networks in connection with the telecast of our Knicks and Rangers games.\nNational and international telecast arrangements differ by league. Fees paid by telecasters under these arrangements are pooled by each league and then generally shared equally among all teams.\nVenue Signage and Sponsorships and Ad Sales Commission\nWe earn revenues through the sale of signage space at The Garden and sponsorship rights in connection with our teams and certain other sporting events. Our strategy is to develop marketing partnerships with world-class brands by creating customized platforms that achieve our partners' business objectives. Signage sales generally involve the sale of advertising space within The Garden during our sports teams' home games and include the sale of signage on the ice and on the boards of the hockey rink during Rangers games, courtside during Knicks games, and/or on the various scoreboards and display panels at The Garden. We offer both television camera-visible and non-camera-visible signage space.\nSponsorship rights generally require us to use the name, logos and other trademarks of a sponsor in our advertising and in promotions for our teams and during our sports events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our teams and venues in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in The Garden or in the community.\nThe Company and MSG Networks are parties to an advertising sales representation agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we have the exclusive right and obligation to sell advertising availabilities of MSG Networks. We are entitled to and earn commission revenue on such sales. The expense associated with advertising personnel, which was transferred from MSG Networks in connection with this advertising sales representation agreement, is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nConcessions\nWe sell food and beverages during all sporting events held at our venues. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of our concession revenues, we also provide higher-end dining at our full service restaurant and clubs as well as catering for suites at The Garden.\nMerchandise\nWe earn revenues from the sale of our teams' merchandise both through the in-venue (and in some cases, online) sale of items bearing the logos or other marks of our teams and through our share of sports league distributions of royalties and other revenues from the sports leagues' licensing of team and sports league trademarks, which revenues are generally shared equally among the teams in the sports leagues. By agreement among the teams, each of the sports leagues in which we operate acts as an agent for the sports teams to license their logos and other marks, as well as the marks of the leagues, subject to certain rights retained by the teams to license these marks within their arenas and the geographic areas in which they operate.\nExpenses\nThe most significant expenses in our MSG Sports segment are player and other team personnel salaries and charges for transactions relating to players for career-ending and season-ending injuries, trades, and waivers and contract termination costs of players and other team personnel, including team executives. We also incur costs for travel, player insurance, league operating assessments (including a 6% NBA assessment on regular season ticket sales), NHL and NBA revenue sharing and NBA luxury tax. We charge a portion of our actual expenses associated with the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of our venues, along with a portion of our corporate expenses, to our MSG Sports segment. However, the operating results of our MSG Sports segment benefit from the fact that no rent is charged to the segment for use of the Company's owned venues. We do not allocate to our segments depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden or the Forum.\nPlayer Salaries, Escrow System/Revenue Sharing and NBA Luxury Tax\nThe amount we pay an individual player is typically determined by negotiation between the player (typically represented by an agent) and us, and is generally influenced by the player's past performance, the amounts paid to players with comparable past performance by other sports teams and restrictions in the CBAs, including the salary floors and caps and NBA luxury tax. The leagues' CBAs typically contain restrictions on when players may move between league clubs following expiration of their contracts and what rights their current and former clubs have.\nNBA CBA. The NBA CBA expires after the 2023-24 season (although the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association ( NBPA\u201d) each have the right to terminate the CBA following the 2022-23 season). The NBA CBA contains a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team's aggregate player salaries with a requirement that the team pay any deficiency to the players on its roster) and a soft\u201d salary cap (i.e., a cap on each team's aggregate player salaries but with certain exceptions that enable teams to pay players more, sometimes substantially more, than the cap).\nNBA Luxury Tax. Amounts in this paragraph are in thousands, except for luxury tax rates. The NBA CBA provides for a luxury tax that is applicable to all teams with aggregate player salaries exceeding a threshold that is set prior to each season based upon projected league-wide revenues (as defined under the CBA). The luxury tax rates for teams with aggregate player salaries above such threshold start at $1.50 for each $1.00 of team salary above the threshold up to $5,000 and scale up to $3.25 for each $1.00 of team salary that is from $15,000 to $20,000 over the threshold, and an additional tax rate increment of $0.50 applies for each additional $5,000 (or part thereof) of team salary in excess of $20,000 over the threshold. In addition, for teams that are taxpayers in at least three of four previous seasons, the above tax rates are increased by $1.00 for each increment. Fifty percent of the aggregate luxury tax payments is a funding source for the revenue sharing plan and the remaining 50% of such payments is distributed in equal shares to non-taxpaying teams. For the 2018-19, 2017-18, and 2016-17 seasons, the Knicks were not a luxury tax payer and we recorded approximately $3,100, $2,200, and $500, respectively, of luxury tax proceeds from tax-paying teams. Tax obligations for years beyond the 2018-19 season will be subject to contractual player payroll obligations and corresponding NBA luxury tax thresholds. The Company recognizes the estimated amount associated with luxury tax expense or the amount it expects to receive as a non-tax paying team, if applicable, on a straight-line basis over the NBA regular season as a component of direct operating expenses.\nNBA Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NBA CBA also provides that players collectively receive a designated percentage of league-wide revenues (net of certain direct expenses) as compensation (approximately 51%), and the teams retain the remainder. The percentage of league-wide revenues paid as compensation and retained by the teams does not apply evenly across all teams and, accordingly, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Knicks' revenues than other NBA teams. Throughout each season, NBA teams withhold 10% of each player's salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league's aggregate player compensation exceeds the designated percentage of league-wide revenues, some or all of such escrowed amounts are distributed equally to all NBA teams. In the event that the league's aggregate player compensation is below the designated percentage of league-wide revenues, the teams will remit the shortfall to the NBPA for distribution to the players.\nThe NBA also has a revenue sharing plan that generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds to teams with below-average net revenues (as defined in the plan), subject to reduction or elimination based on individual team market size and profitability. The plan is funded by a combination of disproportionate contributions from teams with above-average net revenues, subject to certain profit-based limits (each as defined in the plan); 50% of aggregate league-wide luxury tax proceeds (see above); and collective league sources, if necessary. Additional amounts may also be distributed on a discretionary basis, funded by assessments on playoff ticket revenues and through collective league sources.\nWe record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from the escrow. Our net provision for these items for the year ended June 30, 2019 was approximately $36,000. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 season may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NBA teams for the season and other factors.\nNHL CBA. The NHL CBA expires September 15, 2022 (although the NHL and NHL Players' Association each have the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2019-20 season). The NHL CBA provides for a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team's aggregate player salaries) and a hard\u201d salary cap (i.e., teams may not exceed a stated maximum that was negotiated for the 2013-14 season and has been adjusted each season thereafter based upon league-wide revenues).\nNHL Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NHL CBA provides that each season the players receive as player compensation 50% of that season's league-wide revenues. Because the aggregate amount to be paid to the players is based upon league-wide revenues and not on a team-by-team basis, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Rangers' revenues than other NHL teams pay of their own revenues. In order to implement the salary cap system, NHL teams withhold a portion of each player's salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league's aggregate player compensation for a season exceeds the designated percentage (50%) of that season's league-wide revenues, the excess is retained by the league. Any such excess funds are distributed to all teams in equal shares.\nThe NHL CBA also provides for a revenue sharing plan. The plan generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds approximating 6.055% of league-wide revenues to certain qualifying lower-revenue teams and is funded as follows: (a) 50% from contributions by the top ten revenue earning teams (based on pre-season and regular season revenues) in accordance with a formula; (b) then from payments by teams participating in the playoffs, with each team contributing 35% of its gate receipts for each home playoff game; and (c) the remainder from centrally-generated NHL sources. We record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from the escrow. Our net provisions for these items for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $23,300 and $21,100, respectively. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 and 2017-18 seasons may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NHL teams for the season and other factors.\nOther Team Operating Expenses\nOur teams also pay expenses associated with day-to-day operations, including for travel, equipment maintenance and player insurance. Direct variable day-of-event costs incurred at The Garden, such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security, and event production are charged to our MSG Sports segment.\nOperating costs of the Company's training center in Greenburgh, NY are also charged to our MSG Sports segment. The operation of the Hartford Wolf Pack is also a net Rangers player development expense for our MSG Sports segment.\nAs members of the NBA and NHL, the Knicks and Rangers, respectively, are also subject to league assessments. The governing bodies of each league determine the amount of each season's league assessments that are required from each member team. The NBA imposed on each team a 6% assessment on regular season ticket revenue.\nOur MSG Sports segment also incurs costs associated with VIP amenities provided to certain ticket holders.\nOther Expenses\nMSG Sports also incurs selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nThe operating results of our MSG Sports segment are largely dependent on the continued popularity and/or on-ice or on-court competitiveness of our Rangers and Knicks teams, which have a direct effect on ticket sales for the teams' home games and are each team's largest single source of revenue, as well as our ability to attract high-caliber sporting events. As with other sports teams, the competitive positions of our sports teams depend primarily on our ability to develop, obtain and retain talented players, for which we compete with other professional sports teams. A significant factor in our ability to attract and retain talented players is player compensation. Our MSG Sports segment results reflect the impact of high costs for player salaries (including NBA luxury tax, if any) and salaries of non-player team personnel. In addition, we have incurred significant charges for costs associated with transactions relating to players on our sports teams for season-ending and career-ending injuries and for trades, waivers and contract terminations of players and other team personnel, including team executives. Waiver and termination costs reflect our efforts to improve the competitiveness of our sports teams. These transactions can result in significant charges as the Company recognizes the estimated ultimate costs of these events in the period in which they occur, although amounts due to these individuals are generally paid over their remaining contract terms. For example, the expense for these items was $53,134, $27,514 and $42,337 for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenses add to the volatility of the results of our MSG Sports segment. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to improve the overall quality of our sports teams and our efforts may result in continued significant expenses and charges. Such expenses and charges may result in future operating losses for our MSG Sports segment although it is not possible to predict their timing or amount. Our MSG Sports segment's performance has been, and may in the future be, impacted by work stoppages. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - General Risks - Organized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn addition to our MSG Sports segment's future performance being dependent upon the continued popularity and/or on-ice or on-court competitiveness of our Rangers and Knicks teams, it is also dependent on general economic conditions, in particular those in the New York City metropolitan area, and the effect of these conditions on our customers. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations as it may lead to lower demand for suite licenses and tickets to the games of our sports teams, which would also negatively affect merchandise and concession sales, as well as decrease levels of sponsorship and venue signage revenues. These conditions may also affect the number of other live sporting events that this segment is able to present.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nAdoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers\nThe Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606. As a result, the Company's revenues were lower by $22,996 and direct operating expenses were lower by $26,239 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in net decreases in MSG Entertainment's revenues and direct operating expenses of $24,347 and $24,545, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the application of principal versus agent revenue recognition on event-related food, beverage and merchandise activities. For the MSG Sports' operating results, the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in a net increase in revenues of $1,351 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily associated with professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues. In addition, the adoption of ASC Topic 606 resulted in a decrease in direct operating expenses of $1,694 for the year ended June 30, 2019, due to the application of principal versus agent revenue recognition on event-related food, beverage and merchandise activities.\nPrior year period results have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC Topic 606 and, therefore, the Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 are not directly comparable to results for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nUnder ASC Topic 606, the suite license revenues for the Company's MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports segments are now recognized proportionately as events at The Garden take place, as opposed to being recognized on a straight-line basis over the fiscal year under the prior standard. In addition, most of local media rights revenue is now recognized over the course of the regular season, as opposed to being recognized on a straight-line basis over the fiscal year under the prior standard.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Note 3. Revenue Recognition for further discussion of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nRenewal of a Ticketing Agreement\nThe Company's consolidated and segment operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the recognition of revenue for events that took place during prior year due to the renewal of the agreement with the Company's ticketing platform provider during fiscal year 2019. The following table presents the impact on the Company's consolidated revenues, operating income and adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 from events in the prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. \nCorporate Expenses and Venue Operating Costs\nThe Company allocates certain corporate costs and its performance venues operating expenses to both reportable segments. Allocated performance venue operating expenses include the non-event related costs of operating the Company's performance venues, and include such costs as rent for the Company's leased venues, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and labor related to the overall management of the venues. Depreciation expense on property and equipment related to The Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden and the Forum is not allocated to the reportable segments.\nPurchase Accounting Adjustments\nIn connection with the BCE, TAO Group, CLG and Obscura acquisitions in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 ( Recent Business Acquisitions\u201d), the Company recorded certain fair value adjustments related to acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations. For the Company's Recent Business Acquisitions, the Company recognized fair value adjustments primarily for (i) recognition of intangible assets such as trade names, venue management contracts, favorable leases, and festival rights, (ii) step-up of property and equipment, (iii) step-up of inventory, (iv) unfavorable lease obligation, and (v) goodwill. The aforementioned fair value adjustments, except for goodwill, will be expensed as incremental non-cash expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations based on their estimated useful lives ( Purchase Accounting Adjustments\u201d). The Company does not allocate any Purchase Accounting Adjustments to the reporting segments and reports any Purchase Accounting Adjustments as reconciliation items in reporting segment operating results. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Segment Information\u201d for more information on the presentation of Purchase Accounting Adjustments.\nInvestments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nIn July 2018, the Company acquired a 30% interest in SACO, a global provider of high-performance LED video lighting and media solutions for a total consideration of approximately $47,244. The Company is utilizing SACO as a preferred display technology provider for MSG Spheres and is benefiting from agreed upon commercial terms.\nIn addition, the Company also has other investments in various sports and entertainment companies and related technologies, accounted for either under the equity method or at fair value. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our investments in nonconsolidated affiliates.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended June 30, 2019 versus the Year Ended June 30, 2018\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.\n\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nThe following is a summary of changes in segments' operating results for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year.\n\n (a) See Business Segment Results\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the operating results of our segments. \nDirect operating expenses primarily include:\n \u2022 compensation expense for our sports teams' players and certain other team personnel; \n \u2022 cost of team personnel transactions for season-ending player injuries (net of anticipated insurance recoveries), trades, and waivers/contract termination costs of players and other team personnel; \n \u2022 NBA luxury tax, NBA and NHL revenue sharing and league assessments for the MSG Sports segment; \n \u2022 event costs related to the presentation, production and marketing of our live entertainment and other live sporting events; \n \u2022 venue lease, maintenance and other operating expenses; \n \u2022 the cost of concessions, merchandise and food and beverage sold at our venues; and \n \u2022 restaurant operating expenses, inclusive of labor costs.  Selling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative costs, including compensation, professional fees, sales and marketing costs, including non-event related advertising expenses, business development costs, as well as costs associated with the development of MSG Sphere, including technology and content development costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $31,507, or 34%, to $123,347 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) higher professional fees, inclusive of costs associated with the potential Sports Distribution, and (iii) the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs not related to its third-party production business.\nIn connection with its MSG Sphere initiative, the Company expects to continue increasing its investment in personnel, content and technology. Based on the timing of these efforts, the Company expects increased expenses in Corporate and Other in fiscal year 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $3,293, or 3%, to $119,193 as compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized.\nOperating loss - Corporate and Other\nOperating loss in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $29,276, or 17%, to $199,592 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of depreciation and amortization under Corporate and Other.\nEarnings (loss) in equity method investments\nEarnings in equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2019 were $7,062 as compared to a loss of $7,770 in the prior year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to (i) the improvement in the net earnings attributable to the Company's investees as compared to the prior year, (ii) the gain on the sale of an Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC ( AMSGE\u201d) investment during the current year prior to the Company's sale of its interest in AMSGE, and (iii) a gain on the sale of the Company's interest in AMSGE during the current year. The increase was partially offset by an impairment charge recorded for the Company's investment in Tribeca Enterprises LLC ( Tribeca Enterprises\u201d) and the amortization of basis difference attributable to intangible assets for the new investments in the current year. The Company sold its interest in Tribeca Enterprises, including the outstanding loan and PIK, effective August 5, 2019. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of an impairment charge recorded for the Company's investment in Tribeca Enterprises.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $3,628, or 59%, to $9,795 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher interest income earned by the Company as a result of higher interest rate. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense incurred under the TAO Senior Credit Agreement and 2017 TAO Credit Agreement. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the TAO Senior Credit Agreement entered in May 2019.\nMiscellaneous expenses, net\nMiscellaneous expenses, net in the current year principally consist of (i) a loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, (ii) non-service components of net period pension and post retirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07, and (iii) dividend income from the Company's investment in TSQ. Miscellaneous expenses, net in the prior year principally consist of non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d) significantly changed U.S. tax law and included a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $1,348 and income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $116,872.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $1,348 differs from income tax benefits derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to pretax loss primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance of $9,421, tax expense of $8,651 relating to nondeductible officers' compensation and tax expense of $3,054 relating to noncontrolling interests. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the statutory federal rate to the effective tax rate.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company used a blended statutory federal income rate of 28% based upon the number of days that it would be taxed at the former rate of 35% and the number of days it would be taxed at the new rate of 21%, effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 of $116,872 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the blended statutory federal rate of 28% to pretax income primarily as a result of a deferred income tax benefit of $113,494 related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities under provisions contained in the new tax legislation, of which (i) $51,015 was due to the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the lower federal income tax rate of 21%, and (ii) $62,479 was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to the new rules, which provide that future federal net operating losses have an unlimited carry-forward period. These rules on future federal net operating losses allow the Company to recognize a portion of its unrecognized deferred tax assets for future deductible items. Other decreases to the statutory rate include $13,211 of income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which offsets the income tax expense attributable to most of the operating income, and $1,974 of income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $1,800 of tax expense related to state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit), (ii) $1,998 of tax expense primarily related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) $2,006 of tax expense related to consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iv) $846 of tax expense related to a change in state tax rates and (v) $223 of other.\nAdjusted operating income\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is their operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits, and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, which is referred to as adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure. In addition to excluding the impact of items discussed above, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions is also excluded in evaluating the Company's consolidated adjusted operating income (loss). The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss).\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income: \n________________\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\n (a) Depreciation and amortization included purchase accounting adjustments of $17,531 and $18,134 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \n (b) Other purchase accounting adjustments for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 primarily included the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.  Adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $28,206, or 14%, to $169,758 as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following:\n\nIncrease in adjusted operating loss in Corporate and Other was lower than the increase in operating loss in Corporate and Other primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization.\nNet loss attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $7,299 and a net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of $7,245 as compared to $628 of net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and $6,518 of net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended June 30, 2018. These amounts represent the share of net loss of TAO Group, BCE, and CLG that are not attributable to the Company. In addition, the net loss attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests includes a proportional share of expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments.\nBusiness Segment Results\nMSG Entertainment\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Entertainment segment.\n\n-----\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nThe results of operations of the MSG Entertainment segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include Obscura's results of operations associated with its third-party production business from the date of acquisition, which was November 20, 2017. The current year results include activities from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. The Company made a decision to wind down Obscura's third-party production business to focus on MSG Sphere development.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $39,204, or 5%, to $819,930 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nThe increase in event-related revenues from concerts was primarily due to additional events and higher per event revenue during the current year, and to a lesser extent, the impact from the recognition during the current year of $1,278 of revenue associated with events that took place in prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. The increase was partially offset by the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year.\nThe increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to (i) higher ticket-related revenue mainly as a result of higher average ticket prices, (ii) an increase in paid attendance in the current year as compared to the prior year, and (iii) the recognition during the current year of $880 of revenue associated with performances that took place in prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal. The Company had 210 performances of the production in fiscal year 2019, as compared to 200 performances in fiscal year 2018 due to an extension of the show's run announced in December 2018. For fiscal year 2019, more than one million tickets were sold, representing a mid-single digit percentage increase as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings was primarily due to the impact of the opening of a new venue, partially offset by (i) the impact of the current year containing 52 weeks of operations as compared to 53 weeks during the prior year, due to the timing of the retail calendar, (ii) closing of one venue, and other decreases. TAO Group's operating results are recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2019 are for the period from April 2, 2018 to March 31, 2019, as compared to TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2018, which are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018.\nThe increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues was due to increased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory and rate increases in suite licenses.\nRevenues from Obscura are included as a result of its acquisition by the Company on November 20, 2017. The current year results include revenues from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. Revenues from Obscura are principally related to its third-party production business.\nThe decrease in event-related revenues from other live events was primarily due to (i) the impact of a large-scale special event series held at The Garden and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden during the prior year, (ii) lower per-event revenue during the current year as compared to the prior year and, to a lesser extent, (iii) the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year. The decrease was slightly offset by additional events held at the Company's venues during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related revenues was primarily due to lower ticket-related revenues from the Boston Calling Music Festival.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $24,218, or 5%, to $507,091 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings was primarily due to the costs associated with the opening of a new venue inclusive of increases in (i) employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) costs of food and beverage, and (iii) performer costs, as well as (iv) the impact of certain costs being reported as direct operating expenses during the current year as compared to being reported as selling, general and administrative expenses during the prior year.\nDirect operating expenses from Obscura are included as a result of its acquisition by the Company on November 20, 2017. The current year results include direct operating expenses from Obscura for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. Direct operating expenses from Obscura are principally related to third-party production business.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to (i) higher labor costs, (ii) higher costs associated with more performances in the current year, (iii) costs related to show enhancements, and (iv) higher marketing expenses during the current year as compared to the prior year. The Company had 210 performances of the production in fiscal year 2019, as compared to 200 performances in fiscal year 2018 due to an extension of the show's run announced in December 2018.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite licenses was primarily due to increased sales of existing sponsorship inventory.\nThe decrease in event-related direct operating expenses from other live events was primarily due to (i) the impact of a large-scale special event series held at The Garden and Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden during the prior year, (ii) the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year, and (iii) to a lesser extent, lower per event expenses during the current year as compared to prior year. The decrease was slightly offset by additional events held at the Company's venues during the current year as compared to prior year.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related direct operating expenses was due to lower costs related to the Boston Calling Music Festival in the current year as compared to prior year.\nThe decrease in event-related direct operating expenses from concerts was primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year. The decrease was largely offset by additional events held at the Company's venues and higher per event expenses during the current year as compared to prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $16,576, or 9%, to $208,577 as compared to the prior year mainly due to (i) higher employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) an increase in professional fees, (iii) venue pre-opening costs associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings, and (iv) the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs related to its third-party production business for a full fiscal year as compared to approximately seven months (from November 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018) in fiscal year 2018. The increase was partially offset by the impact of certain costs being reported as direct operating expenses during the current year as compared to being reported as selling, general and administrative expenses during the prior year.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $1,245, or 1%, to $86,092 as compared to the prior year due to increases in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses largely offset by higher revenues as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $4 to $118,348 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was lower than a decrease in operating income primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nMSG Sports\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Sports segment.\n\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $34,093, or 4%, to $812,746 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nThe increase in event-related revenues from other live sporting events was due to higher per event revenue, slightly offset by fewer events during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues from league distributions included the impact of timing.\nThe increase in local media rights fees from MSG Networks was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nThe increase in suite license fee revenue was primarily due to rate increases, partially offset by lower sales of suite products.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues and ad sales commission was primarily due to higher ad sales commission revenue and the impact of the new revenue recognition standard in the current year, partially offset by decreased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory.\nThe decrease in professional sports teams' pre/regular season ticket-related revenues was primarily due to lower average Rangers, Knicks and Liberty per-game revenue, partially offset by the impact of the recognition of $2,753 during the current year associated with games played in the prior year as a result of the ticketing agreement renewal.\nThe decrease in professional sports teams' pre/regular season food, beverage and merchandise sales was primarily due to lower average per-game revenue during the current year as compared to the prior year and the Liberty playing fewer games at The Garden during the current year as compared to the prior year. The Liberty played ten fewer regular season games at The Garden during the current year as compared to the prior year, as the Liberty played the majority of their home games at the Westchester County Center, located in White Plains, NY, during the current year. Additionally, the Liberty was sold in January 2019.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $28,967, or 6%, to $485,899 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nNet provisions for certain team personnel transactions and for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax were as follows:\n\nTeam personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2019 reflect provisions, net of recoveries recorded in the current year associated with prior year team personnel provisions, recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $46,950, (ii) player trades of $5,642, and (iii) season-ending player injuries of $542. Team personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflect provisions recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $21,559, (ii) season-ending player injuries of $4,273, which is net of insurance recoveries of $468 and (iii) player trades of $1,682.\nThe increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax reflects higher provisions for league revenue sharing expense of $1,647, partially offset by higher estimated NBA luxury tax credit of $914. Higher league revenue sharing expense primarily reflected higher estimated NHL and NBA revenue sharing expense for the 2018-19 season, partially offset by higher estimated net player escrow recoveries and, to a lesser extent, net adjustments to prior seasons' revenue sharing expense. The actual amounts for the 2018-19 season may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors. The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2018-19 and 2017-18 seasons and, therefore, received equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams.\nThe increase in event-related expenses associated with other live sporting events was due to higher per event expenses, slightly offset by fewer events during the current year as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in other team operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in league assessments and other net increases, partially offset by lower player insurance costs and lower day-of-event costs, primarily driven by the Liberty playing fewer games at The Garden during the current year as compared to the prior year. During the current year, the majority of the Liberty's home games were played at the Westchester County Center, located in White Plains, NY. Additionally, the Liberty was sold in January 2019.\nThe decrease in team personnel compensation was primarily due to roster changes at the Company's sports teams.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $11,409, or 6%, to $196,548 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits and an increase in marketing costs.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $6,580, or 5%, to $122,521 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher direct operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $5,408, or 4%, to $146,672, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was lower than the decrease in operating income primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nComparison of the Year Ended June 30, 2018 versus the Year Ended June 30, 2017\nFactors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\nTAO Group's Operating Results\nThe Company completed the TAO Group acquisition on January 31, 2017. TAO Group's financial statements are not available within the time constraints the Company requires to ensure the financial accuracy of the operating results. Therefore, the Company records TAO Group's operating results in its consolidated statements of operations under the MSG Entertainment segment on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related operating results for the year ended June 30, 2018 are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018. TAO Group's related operating results for the year ended June 30, 2017 are for the period from February 1, 2017 to March 26, 2017.\nCLG's Operating Results\nThe results of operations of the Company and the MSG Sports segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include CLG's results of operations from the date of acquisition, which was July 28, 2017. The Company's results for the year ended June 30, 2017 do not include any of CLG's operating results.\nObscura's Operating Results\nThe results of operations of the Company and the MSG Entertainment segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 include Obscura's results of operations from the date of acquisition, which was November 20, 2017. The Company's results for the year ended June 30, 2017 do not include any of Obscura's operating results.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.\n\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nThe following is a summary of changes in segments' operating results for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year.\n\n (a) See Business Segment Results\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the operating results of our segments. \n (b) In connection with the purchase price allocation of the TAO Group acquisition on January 31, 2017, the inventory value was increased by $8,705 and was fully expensed to direct operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2017 as the related inventory was consumed. In addition, the direct operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 principally reflect the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition.  Selling, general and administrative expenses - Corporate and Other\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $12,400, or 16%, to $91,840 as compared to prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits, as well as the inclusion of Obscura's selling, general and administrative costs not related to its third-party production business. The increase was partially offset by a management fee earned for providing management and strategic services to TAO Group (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion), which is eliminated in the Company's consolidated results of operations presented above, as well as certain favorable adjustments related to contingent payments for the Company's business acquisitions.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $15,098, or 14%, to $122,486 as compared to the prior year primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments and the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment associated with the business acquisitions (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\u201d for further discussion), partially offset by certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized.\nOperating loss - Corporate and Other\nOperating loss in Corporate and Other for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,298, or 4%, to $170,316 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of depreciation and amortization under Corporate and Other.\nLoss in equity method investments\nLoss in equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2018 improved $22,206, or 74%, to $7,770 as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $20,613 recorded during the prior year to write off the carrying value of the equity method investment in Fuse Media.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $1,480, or 19%, to $6,167 as compared to the prior year primarily due to interest expense incurred under the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for discussion. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income earned by the Company as a result of higher interest rates and a change in investment mix. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized interest income of $938, which was received in connection with the repayment of a loan receivable from one of the Company's nonconsolidated affiliates that was on a nonaccrual status.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net for the year ended June 30, 2018 principally consist of non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07. Miscellaneous income in the prior year consists principally of (i) non-service components of net period pension and postretirement benefit cost in accordance with ASU No. 2017-07 and (ii) the recovery of certain claims in connection with a third-party bankruptcy proceeding. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, TCJA was enacted, which significantly changed the existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company was required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment even though certain key aspects of the new law became effective January 1, 2018. The Company used a blended statutory federal income tax rate of 28% based upon the number of days that it will be taxed at the former rate of 35% and the number of days it will be taxed at the new rate of 21% to calculate its most recent effective tax rate.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $116,872 and income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $4,404.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2018 of $116,872 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the blended statutory federal rate of 28% to pretax income primarily as a result of a deferred income tax benefit of $113,494 related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities under provisions contained in the new tax legislation, of which (i) $51,015 was due to the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the lower federal income tax rate of 21%, and (ii) $62,479 was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to the new rules, which provide that future federal net operating losses have an unlimited carry-forward period. These rules on future federal net operating losses allow the Company to recognize a portion of its unrecognized deferred tax assets for future deductible items. Other decreases to the statutory rate include $13,211 of income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which offsets the income tax expense attributable to most of the operating income, and $1,974 of income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $1,800 of tax expense related to state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit), (ii) $1,998 of tax expense primarily related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) $2,006 of tax expense related to consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iv) $846 of tax expense related to a change in state tax rates and (v) $223 of other.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $4,404 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 35% to pretax income primarily as a result of (i) an increase of $30,697 in recorded federal and state valuation allowances, (ii) tax expense of $3,449 related to non-deductible expenses, (iii) the tax impact of consolidated partnership book income attributable to non-controlling interests of $1,414, (iv) deferred expense of $1,329 based on tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles that are not available as a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets, and (v) expense of $672 recorded due to a state rate change computed as a result of filed state tax returns. This tax expense is offset by (i) $6,716 of state tax benefit (net of federal effect), (ii) $6,477 of tax benefit related to other comprehensive income gains recorded in continuing operations and (iii) $354 of other.\nAdjusted operating income\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income:\n\n________________\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\n (a) Depreciation and amortization included purchase accounting adjustments of $18,134 and $3,152 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (b) Other purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily included the amortization of favorable leases in connection with the TAO Group acquisition. Other purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily included an inventory adjustment of $8,705 that was expensed to direct operating expenses and associated with the TAO Group acquisition on January 31, 2017 as the related inventory was consumed.  Adjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $96,291, or 95%, to $197,964 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nIncrease in adjusted operating loss in Corporate and Other were primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits, excluding share-based compensation expense, and the inclusion of Obscura expenses associated with the Company's business development initiatives partially offset by a management fee earned for providing management and strategic services to TAO Group (see - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion), which is eliminated in the Company's consolidated results of operations presented above. These increases were offset by certain favorable adjustments related to contingent payments for the Company's business acquisitions.\nNet income (loss) attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $628 and a net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of $6,518 as compared to $4,370 of net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and $304 of net income attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended June 30, 2017. These amounts represent the share of net income (loss) of TAO Group, BCE, and CLG that are not attributable to the Company. In addition, the net income (loss) attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests includes a proportional share of expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions\u201d for further discussion.\nBusiness Segment Results\nMSG Entertainment\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Entertainment segment.\n\nNM - Percentage is not meaningful\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $274,258, or 54%, to $780,726 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nThe inclusion of revenues associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings is the result of the acquisition of a 62.5% interest in TAO Group on January 31, 2017, and primarily reflects revenues generated from food and beverage sales. TAO Group's operating results are recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2018 are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018, as compared to TAO Group's related revenues for fiscal year 2017, which are for the period from February 1, 2017 to March 26, 2017. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at The Garden was due to a change in the mix of events (including the impact of a large-scale event held during the current year) and additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at Radio City Music Hall, excluding the Christmas Spectacular and the New York Spectacular, was primarily due to additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at the Forum was due to a change in the mix of events and an additional event held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden was primarily due to a change in the mix of events partially offset by fewer events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related revenues at The Chicago Theatre was primarily due to additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues from the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to higher ticket-related revenue, mainly as a result of higher average ticket prices and the impact of additional scheduled performances, partially offset by a decrease in average per-show paid attendance in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year. The Company had 200 scheduled performances of the production during the 2018 holiday season as compared to 197 scheduled performances during the 2017 holiday season. For the 2017 holiday season, more than one million tickets were sold, representing a low single digit percentage decrease as compared to the 2016 holiday season.\nThe increase in venue-related sponsorship and signage and suite rental fee revenues was due to higher suite rental fee revenue mainly driven by contractual rate increases.\nThe decrease in revenues from the presentation of the New York Spectacular was driven by no scheduled performances in fiscal year 2018 as compared to 56 scheduled performances presented in the prior year. This was a result of the Company's decision to suspend the planned 2017 presentation announced in February 2017.\nThe decrease in BCE event-related revenues was primarily due to a decrease in ticket-related revenue.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $104,911, or 28%, to $482,873 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\nThe inclusion of direct operating expenses associated with entertainment dining and nightlife offerings is the result of the acquisition of a 62.5% interest in TAO Group on January 31, 2017, and primarily reflects costs associated with food and beverage sales, inclusive of labor costs, as well as venue-related operating expenses. TAO Group's operating results are recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations on a three-month lag basis. As a result, TAO Group's related direct operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 are for the period from March 27, 2017 to April 1, 2018, as compared to TAO Group's related direct operating expenses for fiscal year 2017, which are for the period from February 1, 2017 to March 26, 2017. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion.\nThe increase in event-related direct operating expenses at The Garden was due to a change in the mix of events (including the impact of a large-scale event held during the current year) and additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related direct operating expenses at the Forum was due to a change in the mix of events as well as one additional event held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related direct operating expenses at Radio City Music Hall, excluding the Christmas Spectacular and the New York Spectacular, was due to additional events partially offset by a change in the mix of events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in BCE event-related direct operating expenses was due to higher costs related to the Boston Calling Music Festival in fiscal year 2018.\nThe increase in event-related direct operating expenses at The Chicago Theatre was primarily due to additional events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in venue operating costs was primarily due to higher labor-related costs at our venues during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in event-related direct operating expenses at Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden was due to a change in the mix of events partially offset by fewer events held at the venue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in direct operating expenses associated with the presentation of the Christmas Spectacular was primarily due to higher labor costs and an increase in deferred production cost amortization, partially offset by lower marketing expenses during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year. The Company had 200 scheduled performances of the production during the 2018 holiday season as compared to 197 scheduled performances during the 2017 holiday season.\nThe decrease in direct operating expenses associated with the presentation of the New York Spectacular was driven by no scheduled performances in fiscal year 2018 as compared to 56 scheduled performances presented in the prior year. This was a result of the Company's decision to suspend the planned 2017 presentation announced in February 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $72,449, or 61%, to $192,001 as compared to the prior year mainly due to (i) inclusion of TAO Group's selling, general and administrative costs, including a management fee incurred by TAO Group payable to the Company for providing management and strategic services and, to a lesser extent, (ii) higher professional fees and (iii) an increase in corporate general and administrative costs. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,176, or 63%, to $18,515 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expenses for TAO Group's property and equipment before the purchase accounting adjustments. See - Factors Affecting Operating Results from Acquisitions - TAO Group's Operating Results\u201d for further discussion.\nOperating income (loss)\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 improved $89,722 to $87,337 as compared to the prior year due to higher revenues, partially offset by increases in direct operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 improved by $95,075 to $118,352 as compared to the prior year due to higher revenues, partially offset by increases in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above, excluding share-based compensation expense.\nMSG Sports\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company's MSG Sports segment. \nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $33,331, or 4%, to $778,653 as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: \nThe decrease in professional sports team's playoff related revenues was primarily due to the Rangers playing six home playoff games as the team advanced to the second round of the playoffs in the prior year versus not qualifying for playoffs in fiscal year 2018.\nThe decrease in revenues from league distributions primarily reflects an NHL expansion fee of $15,500 and approximately $15,000 of non-recurring distributions from the NHL and NBA, which were both recorded by the Company in fiscal year 2017. These decreases were partially offset by other net increases, inclusive of league distributions related to CLG, which was acquired on July 28, 2017.\nThe decrease in event-related revenues from other live sporting events was due to a change in the mix of events held during the fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year and one event that generated lower revenue during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' sponsorship and signage revenues and ad sales commissions was primarily due to sales of new sponsorship and signage inventory, increased sales of existing sponsorship and signage inventory and the impact of a marketing partner, upon renewal of its agreement, shifting its marketing partnership spend from a combination of entertainment and sports entirely to sports.\nThe increase in local media rights fees from MSG Networks was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nThe increase in professional sports teams' pre/regular season ticket-related revenues was primarily due to higher average Rangers per-game revenue, partially offset by lower average Liberty and Knicks per-game revenue.\nThe increase in suite rental fee revenue was primarily due to contractual rate increases.\nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $16,063, or 3%, to $456,932 as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: \nThe decrease in professional sports teams' playoff related expenses was primarily due to the Rangers playing six home playoff games as the team advanced to the second round of the playoffs in the prior year versus not qualifying for playoffs in fiscal year 2018.\nThe decrease in event-related expenses associated with other live sporting events was primarily due to a change in the mix of events during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year, and to a lesser extent, one event that generated lower expense during the fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease in team personnel compensation was primarily due to lower overall player salaries during fiscal year 2018 as a result of roster changes, partially offset by higher other team personnel compensation and the inclusion of team personnel compensation for CLG, which was acquired on July 28, 2017.\nNet provisions for NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax and for certain team personnel transactions were as follows:\n\nThe decrease in net provisions for NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense (excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax reflects a lower provision for NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense of $1,878 and a higher estimated NBA luxury tax receipt of $1,712. Lower NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense primarily reflects an increase in estimated net player escrow recoveries, partially offset by higher estimated NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense for the 2017-18 season and, to a lesser extent, net adjustments to prior season's revenue sharing expense. The increase in estimated NBA luxury tax receipt is based on the Knicks' roster, which as of June 30, 2018 did not result in luxury tax for the 2017-18 season. The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2016-17 season and, therefore, received an equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams. The actual amounts for the 2017-18 season may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors.\nTeam personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflect provisions recorded for (i) waivers/contract terminations of $21,559, (ii) season-ending player injuries of $4,273, which is net of insurance recoveries of $468 and (iii) player trades of $1,682. Team personnel transactions for the year ended June 30, 2017 reflect provisions recorded for waivers/contract terminations and player trades of $13,979 and $8,000, respectively.\nThe increase in other team operating expenses was primarily due to higher day-of-event costs and league expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $22,820, or 11%, to $185,139 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower employee compensation and related benefits, and to a lesser extent, lower marketing costs, partially offset by an increase in corporate general and administrative costs. The reduction in employee compensation and related benefits as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by severance-related costs in the prior year, which were attributable to a separation agreement with a team executive.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $1,838, or 20%, to $7,481 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an intangible asset becoming fully amortized.\nOperating income\nOperating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $7,390, or 6%, to $129,101 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues, as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $6,502, or 4%, to $152,080, as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expense, and direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our businesses and maximum borrowing capacity under our $390,000 revolving credit facilities. Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related items, capital spending (including our planned construction of large-scale venues in Las Vegas and London), investments and related loans that we may fund from time to time, repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, repayment of debt, and the payment of earn-out obligations and mandatory purchases from prior acquisitions. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, challenging U.S. and global economic conditions could adversely impact its ability to do so at that time.\nWe regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. Without regard to the impact of the potential Sports Distribution, which would have a positive impact on the Company's liquidity, if and when it is completed, we believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately $1,086,000 in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $108,000 of short-term investments as of June 30, 2019, along with available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities combined with operating cash flows, over the next 12 months, to fund our operations, to pursue the development of the new venues discussed below and other new business opportunities and to repurchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (see Note 2 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's short-term investments).\nTAO Group's principal uses of cash include working capital related-items, investments in new venues, tax-related cash distributions, interest expense payments and repayment of debt. TAO Group plans to continue to grow its business through the opening of new venues. TAO Group regularly monitors and assesses its ability to meet its funding and investment requirements. Over the next 12 months, the Company believes that TAO Group has sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, cash generated from operations and its revolving credit facility to fund its operations, service debt obligations and pursue new business opportunities.\nMSG Spheres\nThe Company has made significant progress on MSG Sphere at The Venetian, its state-of-the-art entertainment venue currently under construction in Las Vegas.\nWe view both innovative design and cost management as key imperatives to the construction process. While it is always difficult to provide a definitive construction cost estimate for large-scale construction projects, it is particularly challenging for one as unique as MSG Sphere. In May, our Board of Directors approved a preliminary cost estimate of $1,200,000 based upon schematic designs for purposes of developing the Company's budget and financial projections. We expect the estimation process for MSG Sphere construction costs will be dynamic as the project moves forward. The actual construction costs for MSG Sphere in Las Vegas incurred through June 30, 2019 were approximately $109,000.\nIn June, the Company announced that it engaged AECOM - a leading builder known for creating bold, innovative projects - as its general contractor for the Las Vegas project. We made the strategic decision to enter into a cost plus\u201d construction contract with AECOM. While this type of contract adds to the complexity of the cost estimation process, we believe our cost plus\u201d construction contract with AECOM will help our efforts to maximize the quality of the work, while permitting us to play a more vigilant role in managing the project's costs, including full transparency into the selection of, negotiations with, and labor and materials utilized by subcontractors.\nIn order to further drive cost control, under the terms of the construction contract, AECOM will receive lower fees if the hard\u201d construction costs come in greater than an incentive benchmark\u201d agreed upon by the Company and AECOM. The process of setting the incentive benchmark began in July when AECOM provided the Company with its proposal, representing its estimate of the hard construction costs of the project. AECOM's initial benchmark proposal, together with the costs of additional core technology and estimated soft costs, results in a project cost estimate that is approximately $1,700,000. We believe this cost estimate is too high and are now in the contractual process of reviewing, testing and challenging the elements of AECOM's estimates and assumptions. We are also value engineering aspects of the project to further reduce costs. We intend to do this in a granular fashion using, among other resources, our outside project manager. We believe we will be successful in achieving significant cost reductions through this process, while noting that there are no assurances that we will reach an agreement on the incentive benchmark.\nThe above cost estimates for the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas have been reduced to reflect the $75,000 that the Las Vegas Sands Corp. has agreed to pay the Company to defray the construction costs of a pedestrian bridge that will link the venue to the Sands Expo Convention Center. The estimates and costs also do not contain significant capitalized and non-capitalized costs for items\nsuch as content creation, internal labor costs, and furniture and equipment. As with any major construction project, the construction of MSG Spheres is subject to potential unexpected delays, costs or other complications. Our goal is to open MSG Sphere in Las Vegas in calendar year 2021.\nSee Exhibit 10.65 to this Form 10-K for a copy of the Construction Agreement, dated May 13, 2019, by and between MSG Las Vegas, LLC and Hunt Construction Group Inc. (AECOM).\nIn February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to the Company's second MSG Sphere and first large-scale international venue. Cost estimates for MSG Sphere in London are still in development as the Company continues to refine its design, which it currently expects will be substantially similar to MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, including having approximately the same seating capacity. The Company submitted a planning application to the local planning authority in March 2019 and expects a planning determination by the end of calendar year 2019 (which may become the subject of further discussions with the planning authority). Our plan is to begin construction on the MSG Sphere venue in London only once we have received all necessary approvals and have further advanced our design for the venue.\nWe anticipate that MSG Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial incremental revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis. For additional information regarding the Company's capital expenditures related to the MSG Spheres, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn connection with these efforts, the Company will need to pursue additional capital beyond that which is available from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital.\nThe potential Sports Distribution, if consummated, will provide the Company with additional liquidity, some or all of which could be used to finance part of the cost of constructing the MSG Spheres. The current plan for the Sports Distribution contemplates that the Company would retain up to about one-third of the common stock of Sports Spinco. Some or all of that interest could be sold for cash by the Company.\nWe will continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where we believe next-generation venues such as the MSG Sphere can be successful.\nFinancing Agreements, Revolving Credit Facilities Provided to Nonconsolidated Affiliates and Stock Repurchases\nFinancing Agreements\nOn September 30, 2016, New York Knicks, LLC ( Knicks LLC\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $200,000 with a term of five years (the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed may be distributed to the Company except during an event of default. There was no borrowing under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, Knicks LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenant.\nOn September 30, 2016, Knicks LLC entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a lender for an initial maximum credit amount of $15,000 and a 364-day term (the Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility\u201d). Knicks LLC renewed this facility with the lender on the same terms in successive years and the facility has been renewed for a new term effective as of September 27, 2019. There was no borrowing under the Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019. This facility does not have financial covenants.\nOn January 25, 2017, New York Rangers, LLC ( Rangers LLC\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $150,000 with a term of five years (the Rangers Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed may be distributed to the Company except during an event of default. There was no borrowing under the Rangers Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, Rangers LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenant.\nOn May 23, 2019, TAO Group Intermediate Holdings LLC ( TAOIH\u201d) and TAO Group Operating LLC ( TAOG\u201d), entered into a credit agreement (the TAO Senior Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and the lenders party thereto. The TAO Senior Credit Agreement provides TAOG with senior secured credit facilities (the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) consisting of: (i) an initial $40,000 term loan facility with a term of five years and (ii) a $25,000 revolving credit facility with a term of five years (the TAO Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities were obtained without recourse to the Company or any of its affiliates (other than TAOG, TAOIH and its subsidiaries). The outstanding amount drawn\non the TAO Revolving Credit Facility was $15,000 as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, TAOIH was in compliance with the required financial covenants.\nOn May 23, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of TAO Group Holdings LLC entered into an intercompany subordinated term loan credit agreement providing for a credit facility of $49,000 that matures in August 2024 (the TAO Subordinated Credit Facility\u201d). The balances and interest-related activities pertaining to the TAO Subordinated Credit Agreement have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. As of June 30, 2019, TAO Group Holdings LLC was in compliance with the required financial covenants.\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility, Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility, Rangers Revolving Credit Facility and the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facilities Provided to Nonconsolidated Affiliates, Financing Agreements and Stock Repurchases\nSee Note 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of the Company's revolving credit facility extended to a nonconsolidated affiliate and the Company's stock repurchases, respectively.\nBilateral Letters of Credit Lines\nThe Company has established bilateral credit lines with a bank to issue letters of credit in support of the Company's business operations. The Company pays fees for the letters of credit that are credited against interest income the Company receives in return from its investments in notes receivable with the same bank. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $12,512 of letters of credit outstanding pursuant to which fees were credited against note investments. Of which, TAO Group had two letters of credit outstanding for $750 as of March 31, 2019.\nCash Flow Discussion\nAs of June 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $1,117,901, as compared to $1,256,620 as of June 30, 2018. The following table summarizes the Company's cash flow activities for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $56,376 to $161,253 as compared to the prior year primarily due to changes in certain assets and liabilities, as well as a decrease in net income to a net loss in the current year adjusted for non-cash items. The changes in certain assets and liabilities are driven by decreases in collections due to promoters and prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by higher accrued and other liabilities, all due to timing. The decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items was impacted by earnings in equity method investments in the current year as compared to a loss in the prior year and lower depreciation and amortization in the current year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $5,903 to $217,629 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items including (i) a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effective January 1, 2018, (ii) a write-off of deferred production costs associated with the New York Spectacular in the prior year, and (iii) an impairment charge to write off the carrying value of the Company's equity investment in Fuse Media in the prior year, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year. This increase was offset by a severance-related payment in fiscal year 2018 attributable to a separation agreement with a team executive which was accrued for as of June 30, 2017 and a decrease in cash received related to deferred revenue primarily due to timing.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased by $50,538 to $232,895 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the Company's investment in a British pound-denominated time deposit and an investment in SACO, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of the Company's 50% interest in AMSGE.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $81,944 to $182,357 as compared to the prior year primarily due to (i) a net decrease in business acquisitions, (ii) repayments received from loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, and (iii) the acquisition of available-for-sale securities in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by (i) higher capital expenditures in fiscal year 2018, primarily associated with the purchase of land in London and costs incurred in developing the Company's new venues in Las Vegas and London, (ii) new investments made in nonconsolidated affiliates, and (iii) a franchise fee payment made in fiscal year 2018 associated with CLG's membership in the League of Legends\u201d North American League Championship Series.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased by $20,649 to $71,746 as compared to the prior year due to the repayment of all obligations under the 2017 TAO Credit Agreement partially offset by (i) proceeds received from borrowings under the TAO Senior Credit Agreement, (ii) lower taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation in the current year as compared to the prior year, (iii repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the prior year as compared to no repurchases in the current year, and other financing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $107,428 to $51,097 as compared to the prior year largely due to lower repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the current year as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by (i) higher taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior year, (ii) distributions to noncontrolling interest holders related to the acquisition of TAO Group in fiscal year 2018 and (iii) a contingent consideration payment related to the acquisition of CLG in fiscal year 2018.\nContractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFuture cash payments required under contracts entered into by the Company in the normal course of business and outstanding letters of credit as of June 30, 2019 are summarized in the following table: \n_________________\n (a) Off balance sheet arrangements disclosed in the table above do not include MSG Sphere related commitments that are not reflected on the balance sheet of $1,049,781. Such arrangements are associated with the development and construction of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas. The timing of the future cash payments disclosed is uncertain and may change as the development and construction of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas progresses. \n (b) Contractual obligations not reflected on the balance sheet consist principally of the MSG Sports segment's obligations under employment agreements that the Company has with its professional sports teams' personnel that are generally guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination. \n (c) Operating lease obligations primarily represent future minimum rental payments on various long-term, noncancelable leases for the Company's venues, including the TAO Group venues, CLG facility, and various corporate offices. \n (d) Consist of letters of credit obtained by the Company as collateral for development of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas and lease agreements. \n (e) Consist primarily of amounts earned under employment agreements that the Company has with certain of its professional sports teams' personnel in the MSG Sports segment. In addition, the amount includes MSG Sphere related commitments of approximately $19,700, all due within fiscal year 2020. \n (f) Pension obligations have been excluded from the table above as the timing of the future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the future funding requirements under our pension obligations.  See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the revolving credit facilities provided by the Company to Tribeca Enterprises.\nIn connection with the TAO Group and CLG acquisitions, the Company has accrued contingent consideration liabilities as part of the purchase price. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the amount reflected on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. In addition, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the principal repayments required under the TAO Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the TAO Revolving Credit Facility.\nMSG and a subsidiary of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. entered into a 50-year ground lease in Las Vegas pursuant to which MSG has agreed to construct a large-scale venue. MSG has announced plans to construct an MSG Sphere on that site. See Item 1. Business - Our Business - Our Performance Venues - MSG Sphere.\u201d\nMSG has the right to increase its equity interest in TAO Group through a call right on the equity of the other TAO Group equityholders after the fifth anniversary of the closing date (January 31, 2022) and prior to such date in certain events. The other TAO Group equityholders have the right to put to TAO Group their equity interests in TAO Group after the fifth anniversary of the closing and, in certain circumstances to put to MSG prior to the fifth anniversary. The put and call prices are at fair market value (or in certain circumstances, subject to a discount). Consideration paid upon the exercise of any such put or call right shall be, at MSG's option, in cash, debt, or MSG Class A Common Stock, subject to certain limitations.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nThe dependence of the MSG Sports segment on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company's fiscal year. The dependence of the MSG Entertainment segment on revenues from the Christmas Spectacular generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income in the second quarter of the Company's fiscal year. In addition, while it does not have a material impact on seasonality of our business, the first and third calendar quarters are seasonally lighter quarters for TAO Group as compared to its second and fourth calendar quarters. As the Company consolidates TAO Group results of operations on a three-month lag basis, the seasonally lighter quarters for TAO will be reflected in the second and fourth quarters of the Company's fiscal year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Management believes its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the Company's arrangements with multiple performance obligations, primarily multi-year sponsorship agreements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets\nThe Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets accounted for approximately 58% of the Company's consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2019 and consisted of the following:\n\nIn assessing the recoverability of the Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, the Company must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve significant uncertainties and judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its long-lived and/or indefinite-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. The Company has two operating and reportable segments, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business.\nFor purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company has three reporting units across its two operating segments, which are MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and TAO Group. TAO Group was acquired after the annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2017 and represents a separate reporting unit within the MSG Entertainment segment for goodwill impairment testing.\nThe goodwill balance reported on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 by reporting unit was as follows:\n\n_________________\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company's reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.\nThe Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for all of the Company's reporting units for the fiscal year 2019 impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as:\n \u2022 macroeconomic conditions; \n \u2022 industry and market considerations; \n \u2022 cost factors; \n \u2022 overall financial performance of the reporting unit; \n \u2022 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and \n \u2022 relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets.  The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and there was no impairment of goodwill identified for any of its reporting units. Based on these impairment tests, the Company's MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and TAO Group reporting units had sufficient safety margins, defined as the excess of the amount by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value of each reporting unit (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). For MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment the most recent quantitative assessments were used in making this determination and due to the proximity of the acquisition date for TAO Group to the goodwill impairment test date, the initial purchase price was assumed to be the fair value of the TAO Group reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test. The Company believes that if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nIdentifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 by reportable segment:\n\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets in the MSG Sports segment and the majority of the trademarks in the MSG Entertainment segment. These assessments considered the events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. Examples of such events and circumstances include:\n \u2022 cost factors; \n \u2022 financial performance; \n \u2022 legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors; \n \u2022 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; \n \u2022 industry and market considerations; and \n \u2022 macroeconomic conditions. \nThe Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and there were no impairments identified. Based on these impairment tests, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of each identifiable indefinite-lived intangible asset's estimated fair value over its respective carrying value. The Company believes that if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nFor other long-lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.\nThe estimated useful lives and net carrying values of the Company's intangible assets subject to amortization as of June 30, 2019 are as follows: \nThe Company has recognized intangible assets for trade names, venue management contracts, favorable lease assets, season ticket holder relationships, non-compete agreements, festival rights and other intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The Company has determined that these intangible assets have finite lives.\nThe useful lives of the Company's long-lived assets are based on estimates of the period over which the Company expects the assets to be of economic benefit to the Company. In estimating the useful lives, the Company considers factors such as, but not limited to, risk of obsolescence, anticipated use, plans of the Company, and applicable laws and permit requirements. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that its estimated useful lives are appropriate.\nContingent Consideration\nSome of the Company's acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating targets.\nThe fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, the Company estimates the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration that the Company will pay to the former owners as a liability in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company measures its contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy, which can result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the fair value of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of TAO Group and CLG.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan\nThe Company utilizes actuarial methods to calculate pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related net periodic benefit cost which are based on actuarial assumptions. Key assumptions, the discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are important elements of the plans' expense and liability measurement and we evaluate these key assumptions annually. Other assumptions include demographic factors, such as mortality, retirement age and turnover. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to various factors, including, but not limited to, changing economic and market conditions. Differences between actual and expected occurrences could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation recorded by the Company. Material changes in the costs of the plans may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of the plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in asset levels and changes in legislation. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best estimate regarding future expectations.\nAccumulated and projected benefit obligations reflect the present value of future cash payments for benefits. We use the Willis Towers Watson U.S. Rate Link: 40-90 Discount Rate Model (which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds) to discount these benefit payments on a plan by plan basis, to select a rate at which we believe each plan's benefits could be effectively settled. Additionally, the Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows ( Spot Rate Approach\u201d). The Company believes the Spot Rate Approach provides a more accurate measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.\nLower discount rates increase the present value of benefit obligations and will usually increase the subsequent year's net periodic benefit cost. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations as of June 30, 2019 for the Company's Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan were 3.58% and 3.18%, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in each of these assumed discount rates would increase the projected benefit obligations for the Company's Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan at June 30, 2019 by $5,950 and $80, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.25%, 3.90% and 4.19%, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the Company's Pension Plans. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.25%, 3.67% and 4.06%, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the Company's Postretirement Plan. A 25 basis point decrease in these assumed discount rates would increase the total net periodic benefit cost for the Company's Pension Plans by $100 and decrease net periodic benefit cost for Postretirement Plan by $6 for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plans' asset allocation structures over a long-term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling, and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward-looking economic outlook, and economic/financial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return was selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (a) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b) projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Company's funded pension plans was 3.72% for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company's funded plans. Adverse market performance in the future could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the Company which could increase the Company's funding requirements related to these plans, as well as negatively affect the Company's operating results by increasing the net periodic benefit cost. A 25 basis point decrease in the long-term return on pension plan assets assumption would increase net periodic pension benefit cost by $300 for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nAnother important assumption for our Postretirement Plan is healthcare cost trend rates. We developed our estimate of the healthcare cost trend rates through examination of the Company's claims experience and the results of recent healthcare trend surveys.\nAssumptions for healthcare cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligation for our Postretirement Plan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019 are as follows:\n\nA one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and benefit obligation for our postretirement plan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019: \nGAAP includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in the Company's earnings that otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur. For example, while the expected long-term rate of return on the plans' assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year. These differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses, which are then amortized over time.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan.", "item_7_tables": "Table 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Key revenue sources include ticket sales, venue rentals, sponsorships, media rights, and concessions.\n\n- Major expenses are performer fees, team personnel costs, venue operating costs, concessions costs, and selling/administrative expenses.\n\n- For 2019 vs 2018:\n- Revenues increased 6% to $1.63 billion, driven by higher event-related and sponsorship revenues.\n- Operating loss was $13.9 million compared to income of $23.1 million in 2018, due to higher operating expenses. \n\n- The Company is developing large-scale venues called MSG Spheres in Las Vegas and London. Construction costs are estimated to be approx. $1.2 billion for Las Vegas. This will require significant capital investment.\n\n- The Company has $1.1 billion in cash/equivalents and borrowing capacity to fund operations and investments over the next 12 months. Additional financing may be needed for the MSG Spheres.\n\n- Key accounting policies involve revenue recognition, impairment testing for goodwill/intangibles, valuation of pension obligations, and contingent consideration liabilities. Estimates and assumptions in these areas can significantly impact reported results."}
